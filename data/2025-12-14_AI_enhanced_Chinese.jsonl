BEHAVIOR-1K focuses on everyday household tasks that people most want robots to assist with and these tasks introduce long-horizon mobile manipulation challenges in realistic settings, bridging the gap between current research and real-world, human-centric applications. This report presents our solution to the 2025 BEHAVIOR Challenge in a very close 2nd place and substantially outperforms the rest of the submissions. Building on $\u03c0_{0.5}$, we focus on systematically building our solution by studying the effects of training techniques and data.

In this work, we propose HeRD, a hierarchical reinforcement learning-diffusion policy that decomposes pushing tasks into two levels: high-level goal selection and low-level trajectory generation. We employ a high-level reinforcement learning (RL) agent to select intermediate spatial goals, and a low-level goal-conditioned diffusion model to generate feasible, efficient trajectories to reach them.\n  This architecture combines the long-term reward maximizing behaviour of RL with the generative capabilities of diffusion models. We evaluate our method in a 2D simulation environment and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline in success rate, path efficiency, and generalization across multiple environment configurations. Our results suggest that hierarchical control with generative low-level planning is a promising direction for scalable, goal-directed nonprehensile manipulation.

Exploiting this redundancy is crucial for achieving the desired workspace and dexterity required for the feasibility and optimisation of toolpath planning. Inverse kinematics algorithms can solve this in a fast, reactive framework, but these techniques are underutilised over the more computationally expensive offline planning methods. We propose a novel algorithm to solve functionally redundant inverse kinematics for robotic manipulation utilising a task space decomposition approach, the damped least-squares method and Halley's method to achieve fast and robust solutions with reduced joint motion. We evaluate our methodology in the case of toolpath optimisation in a cold spray coating application on a non-planar surface. The functionally redundant inverse kinematics algorithm can quickly solve motion plans that minimise joint motion, expanding the feasible operating space of the complex toolpath.

Among systems leveraging this, magnetic field-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems are particularly attractive because they can provide positioning information and build a magnetic field map on the fly. Moreover, they have bounded error within mapped regions. However, state-of-the-art methods typically require low-drift odometry data provided by visual odometry or a wheel encoder, etc. This is because these systems need to minimize/reduce positioning errors while exploring, which happens when they are in unmapped regions. To address these limitations, this work proposes a loosely coupled and a tightly coupled inertial magnetic SLAM (IM-SLAM) system. The proposed systems use commonly available low-cost sensors: an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a magnetometer array, and a barometer. The use of non-visual data provides a significant advantage over visual-based systems, making it robust to low-visibility conditions. Both systems employ state-space representations, and magnetic field models on different scales. The difference lies in how they use a local and global magnetic field model. The loosely coupled system uses these models separately in two state-space models, while the tightly coupled system integrates them into one state-space model. Experiment results show that the tightly coupled IM-SLAM system achieves lower positioning errors than the loosely coupled system in most scenarios, with typical errors on the order of meters per 100 meters traveled. These results demonstrate the feasiblity of developing a full 3D IM-SLAM systems using low-cost sensors and the potential of applying these systems in emergency response scenarios such as mine/fire rescue.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u60ef\u6027\u78c1SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u677e\u8026\u5408\u4e0e\u7d27\u8026\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u6210\u672cIMU\u3001\u78c1\u529b\u8ba1\u9635\u5217\u548c\u6c14\u538b\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u80fd\u89c1\u5ea6\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5efa\u56fe\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u89c6\u89c9\u6216\u8f6e\u5f0f\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u8f85\u52a9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u78c1SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u6216\u8f6e\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7b49\u4f4e\u6f02\u79fb\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u5730\u56fe\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f4e\u80fd\u89c1\u5ea6\u5e94\u6025\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u77ff\u4e95/\u706b\u707e\u6551\u63f4\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u677e\u8026\u5408\u548c\u7d27\u8026\u5408\u4e24\u79cdIM-SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a1\uff09\u677e\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u78c1\u573a\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u7d27\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u4e24\u79cd\u78c1\u573a\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5355\u4e00\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u5747\u4f7f\u7528IMU\u3001\u78c1\u529b\u8ba1\u9635\u5217\u548c\u6c14\u538b\u8ba1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u7d27\u8026\u5408IM-SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u591a\u6570\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e8e\u677e\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5178\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u7ea6\u4e3a\u6bcf100\u7c73\u884c\u7a0b\u6570\u7c73\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u5b8c\u65743D IM-SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4f4e\u80fd\u89c1\u5ea6\u5e94\u6025\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u77ff\u4e95/\u706b\u707e\u6551\u63f4\uff09\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u78c1SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7d27\u8026\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

On the Stochastic Nature and Abductive Appearance of Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "This article looks at how reasoning works in current Large Language Models (LLMs) that function using the token-completion method. It examines their stochastic nature and their similarity to human abductive reasoning. The argument is that these LLMs create text based on learned patterns rather than performing actual abductive reasoning. When their output seems abductive, this is largely because they are trained on human-generated texts that include reasoning structures. Examples are used to show how LLMs can produce plausible ideas, mimic commonsense reasoning, and give explanatory answers without being grounded in truth, semantics, verification, or understanding, and without performing any real abductive reasoning. This dual nature, where the models have a stochastic base but appear abductive in use, has important consequences for how LLMs are evaluated and applied. They can assist with generating ideas and supporting human thinking, but their outputs must be critically assessed because they cannot identify truth or verify their explanations. The article concludes by addressing five objections to these points, noting some limitations in the analysis, and offering an overall evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u770b\u4f3c\u8fdb\u884c\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u5219\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u771f\u503c\u5224\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8etoken\u8865\u5168\u7684LLMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0e\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u6f84\u6e05LLMs\u5b9e\u9645\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u8868\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\uff0c\u8bba\u8bc1LLMs\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u770b\u4f3c\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u5219\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6a21\u4eff\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\u3001\u6a21\u4eff\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90fd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u503c\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5177\u6709\u968f\u673a\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u4f46\u8868\u73b0\u4f3c\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8f85\u52a9\u4eba\u7c7b\u601d\u7ef4\u751f\u6210\u60f3\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u8f93\u51fa\u9700\u6279\u5224\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u4f9d\u8d56\u5176\u5224\u65ad\u771f\u4f2a\u6216\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

The Contextual Reward Machine reduces task complexity by decomposing grasping tasks into manageable sub-tasks. Each sub-task is associated with a stage-specific context, including a reward function, an action space, and a state abstraction function. This contextual information enables efficient intra-stage guidance and improves learning efficiency by reducing the state-action space and guiding exploration within clearly defined boundaries. In addition, transition rewards are introduced to encourage or penalize transitions between stages which guides the model toward desirable stage sequences and further accelerates convergence. When integrated with the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, the proposed method achieved a 95% success rate across 1,000 simulated grasping tasks encompassing diverse objects, affordances, and grasp topologies. It outperformed the state-of-the-art methods in both learning speed and success rate. The approach was transferred to a real robot, where it achieved a success rate of 83.3% in 60 grasping tasks over six affordances. These experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy, data efficiency, and learning efficiency.

We present a novel question generation pipeline that leverages both the text generation and the probabilistic reasoning abilities of SLMs to generate high-quality questions. Adopting a \"generate-then-validate\" strategy, our pipeline first performs expansive generation to create an abundance of candidate questions and refine them through selective validation based on novel probabilistic reasoning. We conducted two evaluation studies, one with seven human experts and the other with a large language model (LLM), to assess the quality of the generated questions.

Our assurance holds under both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, non-asymptotically, and does not require strong assumptions about the true system dynamics, the uncertainty sources, or the quality of the approximate dynamics model. Typically, uncertainty quantification is tackled by making strong assumptions about the error distribution or magnitude, or by relying on uncalibrated uncertainty estimates - i.e., with no link to frequentist probabilities - which are insufficient for safe control. Recently, conformal prediction has emerged as a statistical framework capable of providing distribution-free probabilistic guarantees on test-time prediction accuracy. While current conformal methods treat robots as Euclidean points, many systems have non-Euclidean configurations, e.g., some mobile robots have SE(2). In this work, we rigorously analyze configuration errors using Lie groups, extending previous Euclidean Space theoretical guarantees to SE(2). Our experiments on a simulated JetBot, and on a real MBot, suggest that by considering the configuration space's structure, our symmetry-informed nonconformity score leads to more volume-efficient prediction regions which represent the underlying uncertainty better than existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLAPS\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u611f\u77e5\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u6784\u5efa\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5305\u542b\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6982\u7387\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5f3a\u5047\u8bbe\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u5e03\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u672a\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fdd\u969c\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c6\u4e3a\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u8bb8\u591a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff09\u5177\u6709\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u5982SE(2)\uff09", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u79f0\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5CLAPS\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u674e\u7fa4\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u6790\u914d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5c06\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6269\u5c55\u5230SE(2)\u7b49\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u975e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u5206", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62dfJetBot\u548c\u771f\u5b9eMBot\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bf9\u79f0\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u975e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u4f53\u79ef\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8868\u793a\u5e95\u5c42\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027", "conclusion": "CLAPS\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5f3a\u5047\u8bbe\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u6e90\u6216\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b58\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236"}}

This study establishes that this bottleneck arises from existing generative paradigms succumbing to the Statistical Smoothing Trap, a phenomenon that overlooks the high-entropy information acquisition and structured cognitive processes integral to expert-level writing. To address this limitation, we propose the DeepNews Framework, an agentic workflow that explicitly models the implicit cognitive processes of seasoned financial journalists. The framework integrates three core modules: first, a dual-granularity retrieval mechanism grounded in information foraging theory, which enforces a 10:1 saturated information input ratio to mitigate hallucinatory outputs; second, schema-guided strategic planning, a process leveraging domain expert knowledge bases (narrative schemas) and Atomic Blocks to forge a robust logical skeleton; third, adversarial constraint prompting, a technique deploying tactics including Rhythm Break and Logic Fog to disrupt the probabilistic smoothness inherent in model-generated text. Experiments delineate a salient Knowledge Cliff in deep financial reporting: content truthfulness collapses when retrieved context falls below 15,000 characters, while a high-redundancy input exceeding 30,000 characters stabilizes the Hallucination-Free Rate (HFR) above 85%.

Recently, agricultural robots have been developed to detect and remove weeds using mechanical tools or precise herbicide sprays. Mechanical weeding is inefficient over large fields, and herbicides harm the soil ecosystem. Laser weeding with mobile robots has emerged as a sustainable alternative in precision farming. In this paper, we present an autonomous weeding robot that uses controlled exposure to a low energy laser beam for weed removal. The proposed robot is six-wheeled with a novel double four-bar suspension for higher stability. The laser is guided towards the detected weeds by a three-dimensional linear actuation mechanism. Field tests have demonstrated the robot's capability to navigate agricultural terrains effectively by overcoming obstacles up to 15 cm in height.

These inferred persona attributes are then incorporated into the response generation prompt to produce user-tailored replies.

However, achieving both high load capacity and adaptive compliance in a compact form remains challenging. This paper presents an under-actuated tendon-driven robotic finger (UTRF) featuring a synchronous tendon routing that mechanically couples all joints with fixed angular velocity ratios, enabling the entire finger to be actuated by a single actuator. This approach significantly reduces the number of actuators required in multi-finger hands, resulting in a lighter and more compact structure without sacrificing stiffness or compliance. The kinematic and static models of the finger are derived, incorporating tendon elasticity to predict structural stiffness. A single-finger prototype was fabricated and tested under static loading, showing an average deflection prediction error of 1.0 mm (0.322% of total finger length) and a measured stiffness of 1.2x10^3 N/m under a 3 kg tip load. Integration into a five-finger robotic hand (UTRF-RoboHand) demonstrates effective object manipulation across diverse scenarios, confirming that the proposed routing achieves predictable stiffness and reliable grasping performance with a minimal actuator count.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u8171\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u6307\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u6b65\u8171\u7ef3\u8def\u7531\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u9a71\u52a8\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\u6240\u6709\u5173\u8282\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u521a\u5ea6\u548c\u987a\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u9a71\u52a8\u5668\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8171\u9a71\u52a8\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u6307\u5728\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u7d27\u51d1\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u987a\u5e94\u6027\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u8171\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u6307\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u540c\u6b65\u8171\u7ef3\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u5173\u8282\u673a\u68b0\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\uff0c\u4f7f\u6574\u4e2a\u624b\u6307\u53ef\u7531\u5355\u4e2a\u9a71\u52a8\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u624b\u6307\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u9759\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u8171\u7ef3\u5f39\u6027\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u6784\u521a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u6307\u539f\u578b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u8f6c\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a1.0 mm\uff08\u603b\u6307\u957f\u76840.322%\uff09\uff0c\u57283 kg\u5c16\u7aef\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u6d4b\u5f97\u521a\u5ea6\u4e3a1.2x10^3 N/m\u3002\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e94\u6307\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7269\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u8171\u7ef3\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u521a\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u591a\u6307\u624b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u5668\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u8f7b\u3001\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

In this paper, we study the safety degradation that comes with adapting LLMs to new tasks. We attribute this safety compromise to catastrophic forgetting and frame the problem of preserving safety when fine-tuning as a continual learning (CL) problem. We consider the fine-tuning-as-a-service setup where the user uploads their data to a service provider to get a customized model that excels on the user's selected task. We adapt several CL approaches from the literature and systematically evaluate their ability to mitigate safety degradation. These include regularization-based, memory-based, and model merging approaches. We consider two scenarios, (1) benign user data and (2) poisoned user data.

Among these, DER outperforms both other CL methods and existing safety-preserving baselines while maintaining task utility.

While recent vision-language large models demonstrate strong reasoning abilities, they often underperform task-specific panoramic small models in VLN tasks. To address this, we propose CLASH (Collaborative Large-Small Hierarchy), a VLN-CE framework that integrates a reactive small-model planner (RSMP) with a reflective large-model reasoner (RLMR). RSMP adopts a causal-learning-based dual-branch architecture to enhance generalization, while RLMR leverages panoramic visual prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning to support interpretable spatial understanding and navigation. We further introduce an uncertainty-aware collaboration mechanism (UCM) that adaptively fuses decisions from both models. For obstacle avoidance, in simulation, we replace the rule-based controller with a fully learnable point-goal policy, and in real-world deployment, we design a LiDAR-based clustering module for generating navigable waypoints and pair it with an online SLAM-based local controller. CLASH achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results (ranking 1-st) on the VLN-CE leaderboard, significantly improving SR and SPL on the test-unseen set over the previous SoTA methods.

To overcome these limitations, we propose RoboNeuron, a universal deployment framework for embodied intelligence. RoboNeuron is the first framework to deeply integrate the cognitive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models with the real-time execution backbone of the Robot Operating System (ROS). We utilize the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a semantic bridge, enabling the LLM to dynamically orchestrate underlying robotic tools.

However, these advancements remain largely limited to English, reducing their accessibility for non--English speakers. It is essential to extend these capabilities to a broader range of languages. This paper explores the challenges of adapting an English-trained VLM to different languages. To this end, we will explore and compare different methods for their performance and computational cost. We consider a translation-based pipeline, LoRA finetuning, and a two-stage finetuning strategy that separates vision adaptation from language adaptation. To evaluate these methods, we use a combination of standard multimodal benchmarks translated into the target language and manual assessments by native experts. The results reveal that dataset translation remains a major bottleneck in multilingual VLM performance, with data quality limiting the effectiveness of training and evaluation. These findings suggest that future efforts should focus on native-language dataset collection and improved translation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c06\u82f1\u8bed\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7ba1\u9053\u3001LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ffb\u8bd1\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u82f1\u8bed\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u7528\u6237\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u80fd\u529b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u7403\u7528\u6237\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2\uff09LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b3\uff09\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u9002\u914d\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u9002\u914d\u5206\u79bb\uff09\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f7f\u7528\u7ffb\u8bd1\u540e\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6bcd\u8bed\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ffb\u8bd1\u662f\u591a\u8bed\u8a00VLM\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e94\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u539f\u751f\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Learning process takes time. Babies start learning to move in the restricted liquid area called placenta. Children often are limited by underdeveloped body. Even adults are not allowed to participate in complex competitions right away. However, with robots, when learning from scratch, we often don't have the privilege of waiting for dozen millions of steps. \"Swaddling\" regularization is responsible for restraining an agent in rapid but unstable development penalizing action strength in a specific way not affecting actions directly. The Symphony, Transitional-policy Deterministic Actor and Critic algorithm, is a concise combination of different ideas for possibility of training humanoid robots from scratch with Sample Efficiency, Sample Proximity and Safety of Actions in mind. It is no secret that continuous increase in Gaussian noise without appropriate smoothing is harmful for motors and gearboxes. Compared to Stochastic algorithms, we set a limited parametric noise and promote a reduced strength of actions, safely increasing entropy, since the actions are kind of immersed in weaker noise. When actions require more extreme values, actions rise above the weak noise. Training becomes empirically much safer for both the environment around and the robot's mechanisms. We use Fading Replay Buffer: using a fixed formula containing the hyperbolic tangent, we adjust the batch sampling probability: the memory contains a recent memory and a long-term memory trail. Fading Replay Buffer allows us to use Temporal Advantage when we improve the current Critic Network prediction compared to the exponential moving average. Temporal Advantage allows us to update Actor and Critic in one pass, as well as combine Actor and Critic in one Object and implement their Losses in one line.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSymphony\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\"\u8941\u8913\"\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9650\u5236\u52a8\u4f5c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u3001Fading Replay Buffer\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u80fd\u7b49\u5f85\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u6b65\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u968f\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u7535\u673a\u548c\u9f7f\u8f6e\u7bb1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \"\u8941\u8913\"\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff1a\u9650\u5236\u52a8\u4f5c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4f46\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b2. \u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u53c2\u6570\u566a\u58f0\u800c\u975e\u8fde\u7eed\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\uff1b3.

Existing open-source coding agents provide transparency but frequently fall short when pushed to these industrial-scale workloads, while proprietary coding agents offer strong practical performance but limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We present the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), an open-sourced AI software engineer that can operate at an industrial scale. CCA is built atop the Confucius SDK, an open-sourced agent development platform designed around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK introduces a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension module for robust tool use. Moreover, a meta-agent automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid agent development on new tasks, environments, and tool stacks.

This paper presents a unified GNSS/UWB/IMU fusion framework for seamless pedestrian localization and provides a controlled comparison of three probabilistic back-ends: an error-state extended Kalman filter, sliding-window factor graph optimization, and a particle filter. The system uses chest-mounted IMU-based PDR as the motion backbone and integrates absolute updates from GNSS outdoors and UWB indoors. To enhance transition robustness and mitigate urban GNSS degradation, we introduce a lightweight map-based feasibility constraint derived from OpenStreetMap building footprints, treating most building interiors as non-navigable while allowing motion inside a designated UWB-instrumented building. The framework is implemented in ROS 2 and runs in real time on a wearable platform, with visualization in Foxglove. We evaluate three scenarios: indoor (UWB+PDR), outdoor (GNSS+PDR), and seamless outdoor-indoor (GNSS+UWB+PDR).

Sliding window attention (SWA) reduces this cost to linear complexity, but naively enabling complete SWA at inference-time for models pretrained with full attention (FA) causes severe long-context performance degradation due to training-inference mismatch. This makes us wonder: Can FA-pretrained LLMs be well adapted to SWA without pretraining? We investigate this by proposing Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a set of practical recipes that combine five methods for better adaptation: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling; (2) preserving \"sink\" tokens; (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers; (4) chain-of-thought (CoT); and (5) fine-tuning. Our experiments show that SWA adaptation is feasible while non-trivial: no single method suffices, yet specific synergistic combinations effectively recover the original long-context performance. We further analyze the performance-efficiency trade-offs of different SWAA configurations and provide recommended recipes for diverse scenarios.

In some scenarios, vision is occluded. The robot can then no longer obtain real-time scene state information through visual feedback. This is called ``blind manipulation\". In this manuscript, a novel physically-driven contact cognition method, called ``Contact SLAM\", is proposed. It estimates the state of the environment and achieves manipulation using only tactile sensing and prior knowledge of the scene. To maximize exploration efficiency, this manuscript also designs an active exploration policy. The policy gradually reduces uncertainties in the manipulation scene.

To address these limitations, we propose CoopRAG, a novel RAG framework for the question answering task in which a retriever and an LLM work cooperatively with each other by exchanging informative knowledge, and the earlier and later layers of the retriever model work cooperatively with each other to accurately rank the retrieved documents relevant to a given query. In this framework, we (i) unroll a question into sub-questions and a reasoning chain in which uncertain positions are masked, (ii) retrieve the documents relevant to the question augmented with the sub-questions and the reasoning chain, (iii) rerank the documents by contrasting layers of the retriever, and (iv) reconstruct the reasoning chain by filling the masked positions via the LLM. Our experiments demonstrate that CoopRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QA methods on three multi-hop QA datasets as well as a simple QA dataset in terms of both the retrieval and QA performances.

The challenging matching problem between robots and visual detection renders existing methods highly dependent on identity-encoded hardware or delicate tuning algorithms. Overconfident yet erroneous matches may bring about irreversible damage to the localization system. To address this issue, we introduce Mr. Virgil, an end-to-end learning multi-robot visual-range relative localization framework, consisting of a graph neural network for data association between UWB rangings and visual detections, and a differentiable pose graph optimization (PGO) back-end. The graph-based front-end supplies robust matching results, accurate initial position predictions, and credible uncertainty estimates, which are subsequently integrated into the PGO back-end to elevate the accuracy of the final pose estimation. Additionally, a decentralized system is implemented for real-world applications. Experiments spanning varying robot numbers, simulation and real-world, occlusion and non-occlusion conditions showcase the stability and exactitude under various scenes compared to conventional methods.

These tools generate \"tortured phrases\", statistically improbable synonyms (e.g. \"counterfeit consciousness\" for \"artificial intelligence\"), that preserve the local grammar while obscuring the original source. Most existing detection methods depend heavily on static blocklists or general-domain language models, which suffer from high false-negative rates for novel obfuscations and cannot determine the source of the plagiarized content. In this paper, we propose Semantic Reconstruction of Adversarial Plagiarism (SRAP), a framework designed not only to detect these anomalies but to mathematically recover the original terminology. We use a two-stage architecture: (1) statistical anomaly detection with a domain-specific masked language model (SciBERT) using token-level pseudo-perplexity, and (2) source-based semantic reconstruction using dense vector retrieval (FAISS) and sentence-level alignment (SBERT). Experiments on a parallel corpus of adversarial scientific text show that while zero-shot baselines fail completely (0.00 percent restoration accuracy), our retrieval-augmented approach achieves 23.67 percent restoration accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods. We also show that static decision boundaries are necessary for robust detection in jargon-heavy scientific text, since dynamic thresholding fails under high variance.

Training of novice pilots is protracted due to the lack of functional and easily accessible training simulators. Moreover, work on parafoil trajectory planning suitable for aiding human training remains limited. To bridge this gap, we study the problem of computing safe trajectories for human-piloted parafoil flight and examine how such trajectories fare against human-generated solutions. For the algorithmic part, we adapt the sampling-based motion planner Stable Sparse RRT (SST) by Li et al., to cope with the problem constraints while minimizing the bank angle (control effort) as a proxy for safety. We then compare the computer-generated solutions with data from human-generated parafoil flight, where the algorithm offers a relative cost improvement of 20\\%-80\\% over the performance of the human pilot. We observe that human pilots tend to, first, close the horizontal distance to the landing area, and then address the vertical gap by spiraling down to the suitable altitude for starting a landing maneuver. The algorithm considered here makes smoother and more gradual descents, arriving at the landing area at the precise altitude necessary for the final approach while maintaining safety constraints. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of computer-generated guidelines, rather than traditional rules of thumb, which can be integrated into future simulators to train pilots for safer and more cost-effective flights.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6ed1\u7fd4\u4f1e\u98de\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u98de\u884c\u5458\u80fd\u63d0\u534720%-80%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u5212\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6ed1\u7fd4\u4f1e\u4e8b\u6545\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u64cd\u63a7\u548c\u7740\u9646\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6e90\u4e8e\u4eba\u4e3a\u5224\u65ad\u5931\u8bef\u3002\u65b0\u624b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f3a\u4e4f\u529f\u80fd\u5b8c\u5584\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u4e14\u9002\u5408\u8f85\u52a9\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6ed1\u7fd4\u4f1e\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u5668Stable Sparse RRT (SST)\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u503e\u659c\u89d2\uff08\u63a7\u5236\u52aa\u529b\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u76f8\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u98de\u884c\u6570\u636e\u670920%-80%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6210\u672c\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u98de\u884c\u5458\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5148\u6c34\u5e73\u63a5\u8fd1\u7740\u9646\u533a\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u76d8\u65cb\u4e0b\u964d\u8c03\u6574\u9ad8\u5ea6\uff1b\u800c\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u6e10\u8fdb\u7684\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5230\u8fbe\u7740\u9646\u533a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\uff08\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6cd5\u5219\uff09\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u98de\u884c\u5458\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u66f4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u98de\u884c\u3002"}}

Under this framework, LLMs can operate different types of robots to complete unpredictable complex tasks across various scenarios. This framework features strong generalization, robustness, and efficiency. The application-level system built around it can fully enhance bidirectional human-robot intent understanding and lower the threshold for human-robot interaction. Regarding robot task planning, the vast majority of existing studies focus on the application of large models in single-task scenarios and for single robot types. These algorithms often have complex structures and lack generalizability. Thus, the proposed LEO-RobotAgent framework is designed with a streamlined structure as much as possible, enabling large models to independently think, plan, and act within this clear framework. We provide a modular and easily registrable toolset, allowing large models to flexibly call various tools to meet different requirements. Meanwhile, the framework incorporates a human-robot interaction mechanism, enabling the algorithm to collaborate with humans like a partner. Experiments have verified that this framework can be easily adapted to mainstream robot platforms including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), robotic arms, and wheeled robot, and efficiently execute a variety of carefully designed tasks with different complexity levels.

Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u524d\u6cbf\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u540d\u4e49\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u7269\u7406/\u8bed\u4e49\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc71600+\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u573a\u666f\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301\u5b8c\u6574\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u524d\u6cbf\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b(Veo)\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u652f\u6301\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u8865\u5168\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u6cbf\u591a\u4e2a\u6cdb\u5316\u8f74\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u5305\u542b\u65b0\u4ea4\u4e92\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u65b0\u89c6\u89c9\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u65b0\u5e72\u6270\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u540d\u4e49\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e0d\u540c\u6cdb\u5316\u8f74\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u7ea2\u961f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee5\u66b4\u9732\u8fdd\u53cd\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u540d\u4e49\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5230\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u518d\u5230\u7269\u7406\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u3002\u901a\u8fc71600+\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u516b\u4e2aGemini\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u548c\u4e94\u4e2a\u53cc\u624b\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

In traditional generative grammar, systematic contrasts in grammaticality such as subject-auxiliary inversion and the licensing of parasitic gaps are taken as evidence for an internal, hierarchical grammar. In this paper, we test whether large language models (LLMs), trained only on surface forms, reproduce these contrasts in ways that imply an underlying structural representation.\n  We focus on two classic constructions: subject-auxiliary inversion (testing recognition of the subject boundary) and parasitic gap licensing (testing abstract dependency structure). We evaluate models including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 using prompts eliciting acceptability ratings. Results show that LLMs reliably distinguish between grammatical and ungrammatical variants in both constructions, and as such support that they are sensitive to structure and not just linear order.

Ethical Emergency Braking with Deep Reinforcement Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to enhance driving safety, for example by enabling safe vehicle following and more efficient traffic scheduling. For such future deployments, safety requirements should be addressed, where the primary such are avoidance of vehicle collisions and substantial mitigating of harm when collisions are unavoidable. However, conservative worst-case-based control strategies come at the price of reduced flexibility and may compromise overall performance. In light of this, we investigate how Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can be leveraged to improve safety in multi-vehicle-following scenarios involving emergency braking. Specifically, we investigate how DRL with vehicle-to-vehicle communication can be used to ethically select an emergency breaking profile in scenarios where overall, or collective, three-vehicle harm reduction or collision avoidance shall be obtained instead of single-vehicle such. As an algorithm, we provide a hybrid approach that combines DRL with a previously published method based on analytical expressions for selecting optimal constant deceleration. By combining DRL with the previous method, the proposed hybrid approach increases the reliability compared to standalone DRL, while achieving superior performance in terms of overall harm reduction and collision avoidance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5206\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u8f66\u8ddf\u968f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7d27\u6025\u5236\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u6574\u4f53\u4f24\u5bb3\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u7f51\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86(CAVs)\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u591a\u8f66\u8ddf\u968f\u7d27\u6025\u5236\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f66\u8f86\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u5b9e\u73b0\u6574\u4f53\u4f24\u5bb3\u51cf\u5c11\u6216\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u8f66\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(DRL)\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u6052\u5b9a\u51cf\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u5229\u7528DRL\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f66\u8f86\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u8f66\u534f\u540c\u7d27\u6025\u5236\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528DRL\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u4f24\u5bb3\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408DRL\u548c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8f66\u8ddf\u968f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7d27\u6025\u5236\u52a8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6574\u4f53\u4f24\u5bb3\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff0c\u4e3aCAVs\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Studies suggest that this over-reliance on high-resource languages, such as English, hampers LLM performance in mid- and low-resource languages. To mitigate this problem, we propose to (i) optimize the language distribution by training a small proxy model within a domain-reweighing DoGE algorithm that we extend to XDoGE for a multilingual setup, and (ii) rescale the data and train a full-size model with the established language weights either from scratch or within a continual pre-training phase (CPT). We target six languages possessing a variety of geographic and intra- and inter-language-family relations, namely, English and Spanish (high-resource), Portuguese and Catalan (mid-resource), Galician and Basque (low-resource).

Namely, we seek to stabilize an equilateral polygonal formation on closed planar differentiable curves after a path sweep. The task of finding an inscribed regular polygon centered at the point of interest is solved via a randomized multi-start Newton-Like algorithm for which one is able to ascertain the existence of a minimizer. Then we design a continuous feedback law that guarantees convergence to, and sufficient sweeping of the curve, followed by convergence to the desired formation vertices while ensuring inter-agent avoidance. The proposed approach is validated through numerical simulations for different classes of curves and different rigid formations.

Causal reasoning demands multihop composition and strict conjunctive control, and reliance on spurious lexical relations of the input could provide misleading results. We hypothesize that, due to their ability to project the input into a latent space, encoder and encoder decoder architectures are better suited for said multihop conjunctive reasoning versus decoder only models. To do this, we compare fine-tuned versions of all the aforementioned architectures with zero and few shot ICL in both natural language and non natural language scenarios. We find that ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning, often overfocusing on irrelevant input features. In particular, decoder only models are noticeably brittle to distributional shifts, while finetuned encoder and encoder decoder models can generalize more robustly across our tests, including the non natural language split. Both architectures are only matched or surpassed by decoder only architectures at large scales. We conclude by noting that for cost effective, short horizon robust causal reasoning, encoder or encoder decoder architectures with targeted finetuning are preferable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784LLM\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0ICL\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4e2d\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u6bd4\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65f6\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u624d\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5b83\u4eec\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u8981\u591a\u8df3\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5408\u53d6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u865a\u5047\u8bcd\u6c47\u5173\u7cfb\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u7248\u672c\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672cICL\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u5305\u62ec\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u975e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u3002\u5047\u8bbe\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u56e0\u5176\u80fd\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u591a\u8df3\u5408\u53d6\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "ICL\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e38\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u660e\u663e\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u800c\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u975e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\uff09\u80fd\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u5730\u6cdb\u5316\u3002\u4ec5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65f6\uff0c\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u624d\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u3001\u77ed\u671f\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6216\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u66f4\u4e3a\u53ef\u53d6\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65f6\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u624d\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Analytical models lose fidelity under these nonlinear and nonstationary effects, while standard data-driven methods such as deep neural networks and Gaussian processes cannot represent the diverse residual behaviors that arise across different operating conditions. We propose a regime-conditioned diffusion framework that models the full distribution of residual forces using a conditional diffusion process and a lightweight temporal encoder. The encoder extracts a compact summary of recent motion and configuration, enabling consistent residual predictions even through abrupt transitions or unseen payloads. When combined with an adaptive controller, the framework enables dynamics uncertainty compensation and yields markedly improved tracking accuracy in real-world tests.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u7a7a\u4e2d\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7684\u6b8b\u4f59\u529b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u9645\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u7a7a\u4e2d\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\u65f6\u7ecf\u5386\u914d\u7f6e\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u60ef\u6027\u8026\u5408\u529b\u548c\u7a7a\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u7cbe\u786e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6548\u5e94\u4e0b\u5931\u53bb\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6b8b\u4f59\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u6b8b\u4f59\u529b\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u6700\u8fd1\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u7a81\u7136\u8f6c\u53d8\u6216\u672a\u89c1\u8f7d\u8377\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6b8b\u4f59\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8865\u507f\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u7a7a\u4e2d\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6b8b\u4f59\u529b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we introduce RoleRMBench, the first systematic benchmark for reward modeling in role-playing dialogue, covering seven fine-grained capabilities from narrative management to role consistency and engagement. Evaluation on RoleRMBench reveals large and consistent gaps between general-purpose reward models and human judgment, particularly in narrative and stylistic dimensions. We further propose RoleRM, a reward model trained with Continuous Implicit Preferences (CIP), which reformulates subjective evaluation as continuous consistent pairwise supervision under multiple structuring strategies. Comprehensive experiments show that RoleRM surpasses strong open- and closed-source reward models by over 24% on average, demonstrating substantial gains in narrative coherence and stylistic fidelity.

While recent generative models can synthesize useful data for individual tasks, they do not exploit the compositional structure of robotic domains and struggle to generalize to unseen task combinations. We propose a semantic compositional diffusion transformer that factorizes transitions into robot-, object-, obstacle-, and objective-specific components and learns their interactions through attention. Once trained on a limited subset of tasks, we show that our model can zero-shot generate high-quality transitions from which we can learn control policies for unseen task combinations. Then, we introduce an iterative self-improvement procedure in which synthetic data is validated via offline reinforcement learning and incorporated into subsequent training rounds.

To address these challenges, we present AgriGPT-Omni, an agricultural omni-framework that integrates speech, vision, and text in a unified framework. First, we construct a scalable data synthesis and collection pipeline that converts agricultural texts and images into training data, resulting in the largest agricultural speech dataset to date, including 492K synthetic and 1.4K real speech samples across six languages. Second, based on this, we train the first agricultural omni-model via a three-stage paradigm: textual knowledge injection, progressive multimodal alignment, and GRPO-based reinforcement learning, enabling unified reasoning across languages and modalities. Third, we propose AgriBench-Omni-2K, the first tri-modal benchmark for agriculture, covering diverse speech-vision-text tasks and multilingual slices, with standardized protocols and reproducible tools. Experiments show that AgriGPT-Omni significantly outperforms general-purpose baselines on multilingual and multimodal reasoning as well as real-world speech understanding.

We propose a reinforcement learning approach enabling a drone to navigate unknown three-dimensional tubes without any prior knowledge of their geometry, relying solely on local observations from LiDAR and a conditional visual detection of the tube center. In contrast, the Pure Pursuit algorithm, used as a deterministic baseline, benefits from explicit access to the centerline, creating an information asymmetry designed to assess the ability of RL to compensate for the absence of a geometric model. The agent is trained through a progressive Curriculum Learning strategy that gradually exposes it to increasingly curved geometries, where the tube center frequently disappears from the visual field. A turning-negotiation mechanism, based on the combination of direct visibility, directional memory, and LiDAR symmetry cues, proves essential for ensuring stable navigation under such partial observability conditions. Experiments show that the PPO policy acquires robust and generalizable behavior, consistently outperforming the deterministic controller despite its limited access to geometric information. Validation in a high-fidelity 3D environment further confirms the transferability of the learned behavior to a continuous physical dynamics.\n  The proposed approach thus provides a complete framework for autonomous navigation in unknown tubular environments and opens perspectives for industrial, underground, or medical applications where progressing through narrow and weakly perceptive conduits represents a central challenge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8ba9\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u90e8LiDAR\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u7ba1\u9053\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u5899\u58c1\u63a5\u8fd1\u4ee5\u53ca\u611f\u77e5\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u3001\u5730\u4e0b\u548c\u533b\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08PPO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LiDAR\u5c40\u90e8\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u9010\u6b65\u66b4\u9732\u7ed9\u5f2f\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8f6c\u5f2f\u534f\u5546\u673a\u5236\u5904\u7406\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027", "result": "PPO\u7b56\u7565\u83b7\u5f97\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff08Pure Pursuit\uff09", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u672a\u77e5\u7ba1\u9053\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u3001\u5730\u4e0b\u548c\u533b\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u4e14\u611f\u77e5\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u524d\u8fdb\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f"}}

Integrating these signals is challenging due to their fundamental frequency and informational disparities. In this work, we propose ImplicitRDP, a unified end-to-end visual-force diffusion policy that integrates visual planning and reactive force control within a single network. We introduce Structural Slow-Fast Learning, a mechanism utilizing causal attention to simultaneously process asynchronous visual and force tokens, allowing the policy to perform closed-loop adjustments at the force frequency while maintaining the temporal coherence of action chunks. Furthermore, to mitigate modality collapse where end-to-end models fail to adjust the weights across different modalities, we propose Virtual-target-based Representation Regularization. This auxiliary objective maps force feedback into the same space as the action, providing a stronger, physics-grounded learning signal than raw force prediction. Extensive experiments on contact-rich tasks demonstrate that ImplicitRDP significantly outperforms both vision-only and hierarchical baselines, achieving superior reactivity and success rates with a streamlined training pipeline.

Regulations such as the European AI Act require identifying and mitigating biases against protected groups in data, with the ultimate goal of preventing unfair model outputs. However, practical guidance and operationalization are lacking. We propose a comprehensive data bias detection and mitigation pipeline comprising four components that address two data bias types, namely representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes for a configurable sensitive attribute. First, we leverage LLM-generated word lists created based on quality criteria to detect relevant group labels. Second, representation bias is quantified using the Demographic Representation Score. Third, we detect and mitigate stereotypes using sociolinguistically informed filtering. Finally, we compensate representation bias through Grammar- and Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation. We conduct a two-fold evaluation using the examples of gender, religion and age. First, the effectiveness of each individual component on data debiasing is evaluated through human validation and baseline comparison. The findings demonstrate that we successfully reduce representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes in a text dataset. Second, the effect of data debiasing on model bias reduction is evaluated by bias benchmarking of several models (0.6B-8B parameters), fine-tuned on the debiased text dataset. This evaluation reveals that LLMs fine-tuned on debiased data do not consistently show improved performance on bias benchmarks, exposing critical gaps in current evaluation methodologies and highlighting the need for targeted data manipulation to address manifested model bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6570\u636e\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7f13\u89e3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6765\u5904\u7406\u8868\u793a\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u5316\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u89c1\u57fa\u51c6\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6709\u5bb3\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u503e\u659c\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u6b27\u76dfAI\u6cd5\u6848\u7b49\u6cd5\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u9488\u5bf9\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u6570\u636e\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6570\u636e\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7f13\u89e3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u7684LLM\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u5173\u7fa4\u4f53\u6807\u7b7e\u8bcd\u8868\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u4eba\u53e3\u8868\u793a\u5206\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u8868\u793a\u504f\u89c1\uff1b3) \u793e\u4f1a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff1b4) \u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u8865\u507f\u8868\u793a\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6027\u522b\u3001\u5b97\u6559\u548c\u5e74\u9f84\u4e09\u4e2a\u4f8b\u5b50\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u53cc\u91cd\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1a1) \u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u793a\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u663e\u6027\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff1b2) \u5bf9\u5728\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b(0.6B-8B\u53c2\u6570)\u8fdb\u884c\u504f\u89c1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684LLM\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5e76\u672a\u4e00\u81f4\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u64cd\u4f5c\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u6570\u636e\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u5316\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u80fd\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

This advancement is also inseparable from the oversight automated by reliable verifiers. However, current outcome-based verifiers (OVs) are unable to inspect the unreliable intermediate steps in the long reasoning chains of thought (CoTs). Meanwhile, current process-based verifiers (PVs) have difficulties in reliably detecting errors in the complex long CoTs, limited by the scarcity of high-quality annotations due to the prohibitive costs of human annotations. Therefore, we propose the \\textbf{O}utcome-based \\textbf{P}rocess \\textbf{V}erifier (OPV), which verifies the rationale process of summarized outcomes from long CoTs to achieve both accurate and efficient verification and enable large-scale annotation. To empower the proposed verifier, we adopt an iterative active learning framework with expert annotations to progressively improve the verification capability of OPV with fewer annotation costs. Specifically, in each iteration, the most uncertain cases of the current best OPV are annotated and then subsequently used to train a new OPV through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR for the next round. Extensive experiments demonstrate OPV's superior performance and broad applicability.

We present TRIDENT (Transcription and Routing Intelligence for Dispatcher-Empowered National Triage), a three-layer dispatcher-support architecture designed to structure emergency call inputs for human application of established triage protocols (the ESI for routine operations and START for mass casualty events), even when automatic speech recognition fails.\n  The system combines Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR, local entity extraction via large language models, and bio-acoustic distress detection to provide dispatchers with three complementary signals: transcription confidence, structured clinical entities, and vocal stress indicators. Our key insight is that low ASR confidence, rather than representing system failure, serves as a valuable queue prioritization signal -- particularly when combined with elevated vocal distress markers indicating a caller in crisis whose speech may have shifted toward basilectal registers. A complementary insight drives the entity extraction layer: trained responders and composed bystanders may report life-threatening emergencies without elevated vocal stress, requiring semantic analysis to capture clinical indicators that paralinguistic features miss.\n  We describe the architectural design, theoretical grounding in psycholinguistic research on stress-induced code-switching, and deployment considerations for offline operation during disaster scenarios.

This advancement is also inseparable from the oversight automated by reliable verifiers. However, current outcome-based verifiers (OVs) are unable to inspect the unreliable intermediate steps in the long reasoning chains of thought (CoTs). Meanwhile, current process-based verifiers (PVs) have difficulties in reliably detecting errors in the complex long CoTs, limited by the scarcity of high-quality annotations due to the prohibitive costs of human annotations. Therefore, we propose the Outcome-based Process Verifier (OPV), which verifies the rationale process of summarized outcomes from long CoTs to achieve both accurate and efficient verification and enable large-scale annotation. To empower the proposed verifier, we adopt an iterative active learning framework with expert annotations to progressively improve the verification capability of OPV with fewer annotation costs. Specifically, in each iteration, the most uncertain cases of the current best OPV are annotated and then subsequently used to train a new OPV through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR for the next round. Extensive experiments demonstrate OPV's superior performance and broad applicability.

Massively multilingual models still underperform compared to language-specific adaptations, especially at smaller model scales. In this work, we investigate scaling as an efficient strategy for adapting pretrained models to new target languages. Through comprehensive scaling ablations with approximately FLOP-matched models, we test whether upscaling an English base model enables more effective and resource-efficient adaptation than standard continued pretraining. We find that, once exposed to sufficient target-language data, larger upscaled models can match or surpass the performance of smaller models continually pretrained on much more data, demonstrating the benefits of scaling for data efficiency. Scaling also helps preserve the base model's capabilities in English, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we explore whether such scaled, language-specific models can be merged to construct modular and flexible multilingual systems. We find that while merging remains less effective than joint multilingual training, upscaled merges perform better than smaller ones.

In many such settings, speakers of Indian languages frequently communicate using romanized text rather than native scripts, yet existing research rarely evaluates this orthographic variation using real-world data. We investigate how romanization impacts the reliability of LLMs in a critical domain: maternal and newborn healthcare triage. We benchmark leading LLMs on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries spanning five Indian languages and Nepali. Our results reveal consistent degradation in performance for romanized messages, with F1 scores trailing those of native scripts by 5-12 points. At our partner maternal health organization in India, this gap could cause nearly 2 million excess errors in triage. Crucially, this performance gap by scripts is not due to a failure in clinical reasoning. We demonstrate that LLMs often correctly infer the semantic intent of romanized queries. Nevertheless, their final classification outputs remain brittle in the presence of orthographic noise in romanized inputs. Our findings highlight a critical safety blind spot in LLM-based health systems: models that appear to understand romanized input may still fail to act on it reliably.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u6587\u672c\u65f6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6bcd\u5a74\u533b\u7597\u5206\u8bca\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d5-12\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9020\u6210\u8fd1200\u4e07\u989d\u5916\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7ecf\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u6587\u672c\u800c\u975e\u539f\u751f\u6587\u5b57\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u6d41\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5f88\u5c11\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e66\u5199\u53d8\u4f53\u5bf9LLMs\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b\u4e94\u79cd\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u8bed\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u751f\u6210\u67e5\u8be2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u9886\u5148\u7684LLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u6587\u672c\u548c\u539f\u751f\u6587\u5b57\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u6d88\u606f\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u4e0b\u964d\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u6bd4\u539f\u751f\u6587\u5b57\u4f4e5-12\u70b9\uff1b\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u6bcd\u5a74\u5065\u5eb7\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u8ddd\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd1200\u4e07\u989d\u5916\u5206\u8bca\u9519\u8bef\uff1bLLMs\u901a\u5e38\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u63a8\u65ad\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u7ec8\u5206\u7c7b\u8f93\u51fa\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u62fc\u5199\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u4ecd\u7136\u8106\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5065\u5eb7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u76f2\u70b9\uff1a\u770b\u4f3c\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u4ecd\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u5bf9\u5176\u91c7\u53d6\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u6784\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\u3002"}}

The package provides a simple high-level interface (AutoFusionClassifier) that trains the full pipeline end-to-end with minimal configuration, and a flexible API for advanced users. Under the hood, LabelFusion integrates vector signals from both sources by concatenating the ML backbone's embeddings with the LLM-derived per-class scores -- obtained through structured prompt-engineering strategies -- and feeds this joint representation into a compact multi-layer perceptron (FusionMLP) that produces the final prediction. This learned fusion approach captures complementary strengths of LLM reasoning and traditional transformer-based classifiers, yielding robust performance across domains -- achieving 92.4% accuracy on AG News and 92.3% on 10-class Reuters 21578 topic classification -- while enabling practical trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "LabelFusion\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u878d\u5408\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edfTransformer\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfTransformer\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u505a\u51fa\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4f20\u7edfTransformer\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u4e0eLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6bcf\u7c7b\u5f97\u5206\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u83b7\u5f97\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u62fc\u63a5\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8054\u5408\u8868\u793a\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\uff08FusionMLP\uff09\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728AG News\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523092.4%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u572810\u7c7bReuters 21578\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523092.3%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LabelFusion\u6210\u529f\u878d\u5408\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4f20\u7edfTransformer\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit (1937) using computational text analysis. Dialogue was extracted with regular expressions, then preprocessed, and scored using the NRC-VAD lexicon to quantify emotional dimensions. The results show that the dialogue maintains a generally positive (high valence) and calm (low arousal) tone, with a gradually increasing sense of agency (dominance) as the story progresses. These patterns reflect the novel's emotional rhythm: moments of danger and excitement are regularly balanced by humor, camaraderie, and relief. Visualizations -- including emotional trajectory graphs and word clouds -- highlight how Tolkien's language cycles between tension and comfort. By combining computational tools with literary interpretation, this study demonstrates how digital methods can uncover subtle emotional structures in literature, revealing the steady rhythm and emotional modulation that shape the storytelling in The Hobbit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u300a\u970d\u6bd4\u7279\u4eba\u300b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u57fa\u8c03\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6574\u4f53\u79ef\u6781\u5e73\u9759\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u6545\u4e8b\u8fdb\u5c55\u4ee3\u7406\u611f\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u60c5\u611f\u5728\u7d27\u5f20\u4e0e\u8212\u9002\u95f4\u5faa\u73af", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u6587\u5b66\u4f5c\u54c1\u4e2d\u7684\u5fae\u5999\u60c5\u611f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u300a\u970d\u6bd4\u7279\u4eba\u300b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8282\u594f\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u63d0\u53d6\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5e94\u7528NRC-VAD\u8bcd\u5178\u91cf\u5316\u60c5\u611f\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u6548\u4ef7\u3001\u5524\u9192\u5ea6\u3001\u652f\u914d\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u60c5\u611f\u8f68\u8ff9\u56fe\u548c\u8bcd\u4e91\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5206\u6790", "result": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6574\u4f53\u4fdd\u6301\u79ef\u6781\uff08\u9ad8\u6548\u4ef7\uff09\u548c\u51b7\u9759\uff08\u4f4e\u5524\u9192\u5ea6\uff09\u7684\u57fa\u8c03\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u6545\u4e8b\u8fdb\u5c55\u4ee3\u7406\u611f\uff08\u652f\u914d\u5ea6\uff09\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u60c5\u611f\u5728\u5371\u9669\u5174\u594b\u4e0e\u5e7d\u9ed8\u6170\u85c9\u95f4\u5e73\u8861\u5faa\u73af", "conclusion": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u6587\u5b66\u9610\u91ca\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u6587\u5b66\u4f5c\u54c1\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u300a\u970d\u6bd4\u7279\u4eba\u300b\u4e2d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8282\u594f\u548c\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u53d9\u4e8b"}}

As research increasingly leverages audio-visual materials to analyze the display of emotions, the emergence of multimodal generative AI promises great advances. However, we lack evidence about the effectiveness of multimodal AI in emotion analysis. This paper addresses this gap by evaluating current multimodal large language models (mLLMs) in video-based analysis of emotional arousal in two complementary data sets of human-labeled video recordings. I find that under ideal circumstances, mLLMs' emotional arousal ratings are highly reliable and show little to know indication of demographic bias. However, in recordings of speakers in real-world parliamentary debates, mLLMs' arousal ratings fail to deliver on this promise with potential negative consequences for downstream statistical inferences. This study therefore underscores the need for continued, thorough evaluation of emerging generative AI methods in political analysis and contributes a suitable replicable framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u89c6\u9891\u60c5\u7eea\u5524\u8d77\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8bae\u4f1a\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73", "motivation": "\u60c5\u7eea\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210AI\u4e3a\u60c5\u7eea\u5206\u6790\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u673a\u9047\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e", "method": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u60c5\u7eea\u5524\u8d77\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u8bae\u4f1a\u8fa9\u8bba\u573a\u666f", "result": "\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bmLLMs\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u5524\u8d77\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u65e0\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8bae\u4f1a\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7eed\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u5174\u751f\u6210AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6"}}
