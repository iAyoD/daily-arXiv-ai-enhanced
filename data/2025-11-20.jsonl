Existing approaches typically rely on either lane-changing or inter-vehicle gap creation strategies based solely on local or neighboring information, often leading to suboptimal performance in terms of safety and traffic efficiency. In this paper, we present a V2X (vehicle-to-everything communication)-assisted Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for on-ramp merging that effectively coordinates the complex interplay between lane-changing and inter-vehicle gap adaptation strategies by utilizing zone-specific global information available from a roadside unit (RSU). The merging control problem is formulated as a Multiagent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (MA-POMDP), where agents leverage both local and global observations through V2X communication. To support both discrete and continuous control decisions, we design a hybrid action space and adopt a parameterized deep Q-learning approach. Extensive simulations, integrating the SUMO traffic simulator and the MOSAIC V2X simulator, demonstrate that our framework significantly improves merging success rate, traffic efficiency, and road safety across diverse traffic scenarios."}

The framework extracts vehicle trajectories using YOLOv8 and ByteTrack, computes kinematic features, and employs GPT-5 zero-shot prompting to compare autonomous and human-driven vehicles, generating 35 structured behavioral rule hypotheses. These rules are tested on a validation set, iteratively refined based on failure cases to filter spurious correlations, and compiled into a high-confidence rule library. The framework is evaluated on an independent test set for speed change prediction, lane change prediction, and autonomous vehicle identification tasks. Experiments on over 1500 hours of real traffic videos show that the framework achieves 90.0% accuracy and 93.3% F1-score in autonomous vehicle identification. The discovered rules clearly reveal distinctive characteristics of autonomous vehicles in speed control smoothness, lane change conservativeness, and acceleration stability, with each rule accompanied by semantic description, applicable context, and validation confidence."}

We probe this by training linear classifiers on hidden states after the first t reasoning tokens, showing that eventual correctness is highly predictable after only a few tokens, even when longer outputs are needed to reach a definite answer. We show that, for harder questions, a drop in predictive accuracy highlights a selection artifact: hard items are disproportionately represented in long CoTs. Overall, our results imply that for reasoning models, internal self-assessment of success tends to emerge after only a few tokens, with implications for interpretability and for inference-time control."}

We present LiveCLKTBench, an automated generation pipeline specifically designed to isolate and measure cross-lingual knowledge transfer. Our pipeline identifies self-contained, time-sensitive knowledge entities from real-world domains, filters them based on temporal occurrence, and verifies them against the model's knowledge. The documents of these valid entities are then used to generate factual questions, which are translated into multiple languages to evaluate transferability across linguistic boundaries. Using LiveCLKTBench, we evaluate several LLMs across five languages and observe that cross-lingual transfer is strongly influenced by linguistic distance and often asymmetric across language directions. While larger models improve transfer, the gains diminish with scale and vary across domains. These findings provide new insights into multilingual transfer and demonstrate the value of LiveCLKTBench as a reliable benchmark for future research."}

COMPASS quantifies context reliance via a transparent metric, the Context Reliance Score (CRS), which serves as an online probe of how attention heads ground generation in evidence. Using this interpretable signal, a PID controller dynamically modulates attention heads to maintain factual consistency without retraining or multi-pass decoding.

Although speech synthesis systems have made significant progress in generating natural and intelligible speech, primarily through architectures that implicitly model prosodic features such as pitch, intensity, and duration, the construction of datasets with explicit prosodic segmentation and their impact on spontaneous speech synthesis remains largely unexplored. This paper evaluates the effects of manual and automatic prosodic segmentation annotations in Brazilian Portuguese on the quality of speech synthesized by a non-autoregressive model, FastSpeech 2. Experimental results show that training with prosodic segmentation produced slightly more intelligible and acoustically natural speech. While automatic segmentation tends to create more regular segments, manual prosodic segmentation introduces greater variability, which contributes to more natural prosody. Analysis of neutral declarative utterances showed that both training approaches reproduced the expected nuclear accent pattern, but the prosodic model aligned more closely with natural pre-nuclear contours.

We introduce VIRAL, a visual sim-to-real framework that learns humanoid loco-manipulation entirely in simulation and deploys it zero-shot to real hardware. VIRAL follows a teacher-student design: a privileged RL teacher, operating on full state, learns long-horizon loco-manipulation using a delta action space and reference state initialization. A vision-based student policy is then distilled from the teacher via large-scale simulation with tiled rendering, trained with a mixture of online DAgger and behavior cloning. We find that compute scale is critical: scaling simulation to tens of GPUs (up to 64) makes both teacher and student training reliable, while low-compute regimes often fail. To bridge the sim-to-real gap, VIRAL combines large-scale visual domain randomization over lighting, materials, camera parameters, image quality, and sensor delays--with real-to-sim alignment of the dexterous hands and cameras. Deployed on a Unitree G1 humanoid, the resulting RGB-based policy performs continuous loco-manipulation for up to 54 cycles, generalizing to diverse spatial and appearance variations without any real-world fine-tuning, and approaching expert-level teleoperation performance. Extensive ablations dissect the key design choices required to make RGB-based humanoid loco-manipulation work in practice."}

These capabilities allow using Timed Rebeca to correctly model ROS2 node topographies, recurring physical signals, motion primitives and other timed and time-convertible behaviors.

To mitigate attention-level compression, HTP partitions the input into blocks and prepends block-level summary tokens to subsequent blocks, creating multiple pathways for backward information flow.

When multiple agents interact, it is inherently difficult for them to autonomously break the symmetry of deciding how to pass each other. To tackle this problem, we introduce an approach that quantifies cooperative symmetry-breaking strategies using a topological invariant called the winding number, and learns the strategies themselves through reinforcement learning. Our method features a hierarchical policy consisting of a learning-based Planner, which plans topological cooperative strategies, and a model-based Controller, which executes them. Through reinforcement learning, the Planner learns to produce two types of parameters for the Controller: one is the topological cooperative strategy represented by winding numbers, and the other is a set of dynamic weights that determine which agent interaction to prioritize in dense scenarios where multiple agents cross simultaneously. The Controller then generates collision-free and efficient motions based on the strategy and weights provided by the Planner. This hierarchical structure combines the flexible decision-making ability of learning-based methods with the reliability of model-based approaches. Simulation and real-world robot experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines, particularly in dense environments, by efficiently avoiding collisions and deadlocks while achieving superior navigation performance.

To address this issue, we propose TASA (Teaching According to Students' Aptitude), a student-aware tutoring framework that integrates persona, memory, and forgetting dynamics for personalized mathematics learning. Specifically, TASA maintains a structured student persona capturing proficiency profiles and an event memory recording prior learning interactions. By incorporating a continuous forgetting curve with knowledge tracing, TASA dynamically updates each student's mastery state and generates contextually appropriate, difficulty-calibrated questions and explanations. Empirical results demonstrate that TASA achieves superior learning outcomes and more adaptive tutoring behavior compared to representative baselines, underscoring the importance of modeling temporal forgetting and learner profiles in LLM-based tutoring systems."}

Existing vision models and fixed RGB-D camera systems fundamentally fail to reconcile wide-area coverage with fine-grained detail acquisition, severely limiting their efficacy in open-world robotic applications. To address this issue, we propose EyeVLA, a robotic eyeball for active visual perception that can take proactive actions based on instructions, enabling clear observation of fine-grained target objects and detailed information across a wide spatial extent. EyeVLA discretizes action behaviors into action tokens and integrates them with vision-language models (VLMs) that possess strong open-world understanding capabilities, enabling joint modeling of vision, language, and actions within a single autoregressive sequence. By using the 2D bounding box coordinates to guide the reasoning chain and applying reinforcement learning to refine the viewpoint selection policy, we transfer the open-world scene understanding capability of the VLM to a vision language action (VLA) policy using only minimal real-world data. Experiments show that our system efficiently performs instructed scenes in real-world environments and actively acquires more accurate visual information through instruction-driven actions of rotation and zoom, thereby achieving strong environmental perception capabilities. EyeVLA introduces a novel robotic vision system that leverages detailed and spatially rich, large-scale embodied data, and actively acquires highly informative visual observations for downstream embodied tasks."}

As multilingual Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, robust evaluation methodologies are essential to drive progress toward equitable AI for low-resource languages. Current multilingual VLM evaluations suffer from four major limitations: reliance on unverified auto-translations, narrow task/domain coverage, limited sample sizes, and lack of cultural and natively sourced Question-Answering (QA). To address these gaps, we present a scalable framework to evaluate VLMs in Indian languages and compare it with performance in English. Using the framework, we generate HinTel-AlignBench, a benchmark that draws from diverse sources in Hindi and Telugu with English-aligned samples. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a semi-automated dataset creation framework combining back-translation, filtering, and human verification; (2) the most comprehensive vision-language benchmark for Hindi and and Telugu, including adapted English datasets (VQAv2, RealWorldQA, CLEVR-Math) and native novel Indic datasets (JEE for STEM, VAANI for cultural grounding) with approximately 4,000 QA pairs per language; and (3) a detailed performance analysis of various State-of-the-Art (SOTA) open-weight and closed-source VLMs. We find a regression in performance for tasks in English versus in Indian languages for 4 out of 5 tasks across all the models, with an average regression of 8.3 points in Hindi and 5.5 points for Telugu. We categorize common failure modes to highlight concrete areas of improvement in multilingual multimodal understanding."}

While existing approaches often assume complete environmental unpredictability or rely on global planners, these assumptions limit scalability and practical deployment in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a scalable, region-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework for path planning in dynamic environments. Our method builds on the observation that environmental changes, although dynamic, are often localized within bounded regions. To exploit this, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the environment and deploy distributed RL agents that adapt to changes locally. We further propose a retraining mechanism based on sub-environment success rates to determine when policy updates are necessary. Two training paradigms are explored: single-agent Q-learning and multi-agent federated Q-learning, where local Q-tables are aggregated periodically to accelerate the learning process. Unlike prior work, we evaluate our methods in more realistic settings, where multiple simultaneous obstacle changes and increasing difficulty levels are present. Results show that the federated variants consistently outperform their single-agent counterparts and closely approach the performance of A* Oracle while maintaining shorter adaptation times and robust scalability. Although initial training remains time-consuming in large environments, our decentralized framework eliminates the need for a global planner and lays the groundwork for future improvements using deep RL and flexible environment decomposition."}

We provide the first comprehensive study grounding ID in interpretable text properties through cross-encoder analysis, linguistic features, and sparse autoencoders (SAEs). In this work, we establish three key findings. First, ID is complementary to entropy-based metrics: after controlling for length, the two are uncorrelated, with ID capturing geometric complexity orthogonal to prediction quality. Second, ID exhibits robust genre stratification: scientific prose shows low ID (~8), encyclopedic content medium ID (~9), and creative/opinion writing high ID (~10.5) across all models tested. This reveals that contemporary LLMs find scientific text \"representationally simple\" while fiction requires additional degrees of freedom. Third, using SAEs, we identify causal features: scientific signals (formal tone, report templates, statistics) reduce ID; humanized signals (personalization, emotion, narrative) increase it. Steering experiments confirm these effects are causal. Thus, for contemporary models, scientific writing appears comparatively \"easy\", whereas fiction, opinion, and affect add representational degrees of freedom. Our multi-faceted analysis provides practical guidance for the proper use of ID and the sound interpretation of ID-based results."}

The proposed method uses a particle swarm optimization algorithm that explores the search space to find positions for performing the trajectory. An $α$-shape algorithm is then used to draw the borders of the feasibility areas, and the largest circle inscribed is calculated from the Voronoi diagrams. The aim of this approach is to provide a robustness criterion in the context of robot placement inaccuracies that may be encountered, for example, if the robot is placed on a mobile base when the system is deployed by an operator. The approach developed uses an inverse kinematics model to evaluate all initial configurations, then moves the robot end-effector along the reference trajectory using the Jacobian matrix and assigns a score to the attempt. For the Fanuc CRX10iA/L robot, there can be up to 16 solutions to the inverse kinematics model. The calculation of these solutions is not trivial and requires a specific study that planning tools such as MoveIt cannot fully take into account. Additionally, the optimization process must consider constraints such as joint limits, singularities, and workspace limitations to ensure feasible and efficient trajectory execution."}

Recently, DeepSeek-OCR conducted research into the feasibility of Contexts Optical Compression and achieved preliminary results. Inspired by this, we introduce Context Cascade Compression C3 to explore the upper limits of text compression. Our method cascades two LLMs of different sizes to handle the compression and decoding tasks. Specifically, a small LLM, acting as the first stage, performs text compression by condensing a long context into a set of latent tokens (e.g., 32 or 64 in length), achieving a high ratio of text tokens to latent tokens. A large LLM, as the second stage, then executes the decoding task on this compressed context. Experiments show that at a 20x compression ratio (where the number of text tokens is 20 times the number of latent tokens), our model achieves 98% decoding accuracy, compared to approximately 60% for DeepSeek-OCR. When we further increase the compression ratio to 40x, the accuracy is maintained at around 93%. This indicates that in the domain of context compression, C3 Compression demonstrates superior performance and feasibility over optical character compression. C3 uses a simpler, pure-text pipeline that ignores factors like layout, color, and information loss from a visual encoder. This also suggests a potential upper bound for compression ratios in future work on optical character compression, OCR, and related fields.

Traditional methods often fail to account for complex reasoning -- such as distance, geometry, and inter-object relationships -- while vision-language models (VLMs), despite strong reasoning abilities, struggle to produce a fine-grained region of outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose C2F-Space, a novel coarse-to-fine space-grounding framework that (i) estimates an approximated yet spatially consistent region using a VLM, then (ii) refines the region to align with the local environment through superpixelization. For the coarse estimation, we design a grid-based visual-grounding prompt with a propose-validate strategy, maximizing VLM's spatial understanding and yielding physically and semantically valid canonical region (i.e., ellipses). For the refinement, we locally adapt the region to surrounding environment without over-relaxed to free space. We construct a new space-grounding benchmark and compare C2F-Space with five state-of-the-art baselines using success rate and intersection-over-union. Our C2F-Space significantly outperforms all baselines. Our ablation study confirms the effectiveness of each module in the two-step process and their synergistic effect of the combined framework. We finally demonstrate the applicability of C2F-Space to simulated robotic pick-and-place tasks."}

This work studies the possibility of conducting the denoising process only partially before executing an action, allowing the plant to evolve according to its dynamics in parallel to the reverse-time diffusion dynamics ongoing on the computer. In a classical diffusion policy setting, the plant dynamics are usually slow and the two dynamical processes are uncoupled.

To this end, we introduce dual-efficiency, comprising (i) step-level efficiency, which minimizes tokens per step, and (ii) trajectory-level efficiency, which minimizes the number of steps to complete a task. Building on this definition, we propose DEPO, a dual-efficiency preference optimization method that jointly rewards succinct responses and fewer action steps. Experiments on WebShop and BabyAI show that DEPO cuts token usage by up to 60.9% and steps by up to 26.9%, while achieving up to a 29.3% improvement in performance. DEPO also generalizes to three out-of-domain math benchmarks and retains its efficiency gains when trained on only 25% of the data. Our project page is at https://opencausalab.github.io/DEPO."}

However, variations in patient anatomy and complex human-in-the-loop interactions pose significant challenges for autonomous robotic scanning. Existing ultrasound scanning robots are commonly limited to relatively low generalization and inefficient data utilization. To overcome these limitations, we present UltraDP, a Diffusion-Policy-based method that receives multi-sensory inputs (ultrasound images, wrist camera images, contact wrench, and probe pose) and generates actions that are fit for multi-modal action distributions in autonomous ultrasound scanning of carotid artery. We propose a specialized guidance module to enable the policy to output actions that center the artery in ultrasound images. To ensure stable contact and safe interaction between the robot and the human subject, a hybrid force-impedance controller is utilized to drive the robot to track such trajectories. Also, we have built a large-scale training dataset for carotid scanning comprising 210 scans with 460k sample pairs from 21 volunteers of both genders. By exploring our guidance module and DP's strong generalization ability, UltraDP achieves a 95% success rate in transverse scanning on previously unseen subjects, demonstrating its effectiveness."}

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Trained on diverse human-authored texts, Large Language Models (LLMs) unlocked the potential for Creative Natural Language Generation (CNLG), benefiting various applications like advertising and storytelling. Nevertheless, CNLG still remains difficult due to two main challenges. (1) Multi-objective flexibility: user requirements are often personalized, fine-grained, and pluralistic, which LLMs struggle to satisfy simultaneously; (2) Interpretive complexity: beyond generation, creativity also involves understanding and interpreting implicit meaning to enhance users' perception. These challenges significantly limit current methods, especially in short-form text generation, in generating creative and insightful content. To address this, we focus on Chinese baby naming, a representative short-form CNLG task requiring adherence to explicit user constraints (e.g., length, semantics, anthroponymy) while offering meaningful aesthetic explanations. We propose NAMeGEn, a novel multi-agent optimization framework that iteratively alternates between objective extraction, name generation, and evaluation to meet diverse requirements and generate accurate explanations. To support this task, we further construct a classical Chinese poetry corpus with 17k+ poems to enhance aesthetics, and introduce CBNames, a new benchmark with tailored metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NAMeGEn effectively generates creative names that meet diverse, personalized requirements while providing meaningful explanations, outperforming six baseline methods spanning various LLM backbones without any training."}

We introduce LLM-MemCluster, a novel framework that reconceptualizes clustering as a fully LLM-native task. It leverages a Dynamic Memory to instill state awareness and a Dual-Prompt Strategy to enable the model to reason about and determine the number of clusters. Evaluated on several benchmark datasets, our tuning-free framework significantly and consistently outperforms strong baselines.

With the resultant growth of attention on language processing, significant challenges have emerged, including the lack of standardisation in organising and sharing linguistic data and the absence of standardised and reproducible processing methodologies. Striving for future standardisation, we first propose the Language Processing Data Structure (LPDS), a data structure inspired by the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a widely adopted standard for handling neuroscience data. It provides a folder structure and file naming conventions for linguistic research. Second, we introduce pelican nlp, a modular and extensible Python package designed to enable streamlined language processing, from initial data cleaning and task-specific preprocessing to the extraction of sophisticated linguistic and acoustic features, such as semantic embeddings and prosodic metrics. The entire processing workflow can be specified within a single, shareable configuration file, which pelican nlp then executes on LPDS-formatted data. Depending on the specifications, the reproducible output can consist of preprocessed language data or standardised extraction of both linguistic and acoustic features and corresponding result aggregations. LPDS and pelican nlp collectively offer an end-to-end processing pipeline for linguistic data, designed to ensure methodological transparency and enhance reproducibility."}

We first curate a dataset, PHSD, which contains over 1,000 hours of diverse in-the-wild egocentric data and over 20 hours of on-task data directly aligned to the target manipulation tasks. This enables learning a large egocentric language-conditioned flow matching policy, Human0. With domain adaptation techniques, Human0 minimizes the gap between humans and humanoids.

However, it is ethically and practically infeasible to conduct experiments that require controlling human learners' language inputs. This poses challenges for the verifiability and scalability of language acquisition modeling, particularly in Chinese second language acquisition (SLA). While LLMs provide a controllable and reproducible alternative, a systematic benchmark to support phase-wise modeling and assessment is still lacking. In this paper, we present HSKBenchmark, the first benchmark for staged modeling and writing assessment of LLMs in Chinese SLA. It covers HSK levels 3 to 6 and includes authentic textbooks with 6.76 million tokens, 16K synthetic instruction samples, 30 test topics, and a linguistically grounded evaluation system. To simulate human learning trajectories, we introduce a curriculum-tuning framework that trains models from beginner to advanced levels. An evaluation system is created to examine level-based grammar coverage, writing errors, lexical and syntactic complexity, and holistic scoring. We also build HSKAgent, fine-tuned on 10K learner compositions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HSKBenchmark not only models Chinese SLA effectively, but also serves as a reliable benchmark for dynamic writing assessment in LLMs. Our fine-tuned LLMs have writing performance on par with advanced human learners and exhibit human-like acquisition characteristics. The HSKBenchmark, HSKAgent, and checkpoints serve as foundational tools and resources, with the potential to pave the way for future research on language acquisition modeling and LLMs interpretability.

However, these works assume tokenisation is applied to inputs with unboundedly large alphabets -- an unrealistic assumption, given that in practice tokenisers operate over fixed-size alphabets, such as bytes or Unicode characters. We close this gap by analysing tokenisation over bounded $n$-ary alphabets, considering two natural variants: bottom-up tokenisation and direct tokenisation, where we must, respectively, select a sequence of merge operations or a vocabulary whose application optimally compresses a dataset. First, we note that proving hardness results for an $n$-ary alphabet proves the same results for alphabets of any larger size. We then prove that even with binary alphabets, both variants are not only NP-complete, but admit no polynomial-time approximation scheme (unless P=NP). We further show that direct tokenisation remains NP-complete even when applied to unary alphabets. While unary alphabets may not be practically useful, this result establishes that the computational intractability of tokenisation is not an artifact of large alphabets or complex constructions, but a fundamental barrier. Overall, our results explain why practical algorithms such as BPE and UnigramLM are heuristic, and points toward approximation algorithms being an important path going forward for tokenisation research."}
