Recent advances in image-to-3D models enable the\ncreation of animations directly from user-hand drawings. Distinguished from\nconventional 3D animation, drawing-based 3D animation is crucial to preserve\nartist's unique style properties, such as rough contours and distinct stroke\npatterns. However, recent methods still exhibit quality deterioration in style\nproperties, especially under occlusions caused by overlapping body parts,\nleading to contour flickering and stroke blurring. This occurs due to a\n`stylization pose gap' between training and inference in stylization networks\ndesigned to preserve drawing styles in drawing-based 3D animation systems. The\nstylization pose gap denotes that input target poses used to train the\nstylization network are always in occlusion-free poses, while target poses\nencountered in an inference include diverse occlusions under dynamic motions.\nTo this end, we propose Occlusion-robust Stylization Framework (OSF) for\ndrawing-based 3D animation. We found that while employing object's edge can be\neffective input prior for guiding stylization, it becomes notably inaccurate\nwhen occlusions occur at inference. Thus, our proposed OSF provides\nocclusion-robust edge guidance for stylization network using optical flow,\nensuring a consistent stylization even under occlusions. Furthermore, OSF\noperates in a single run instead of the previous two-stage method, achieving\n2.4x faster inference and 2.1x less memory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aOSF\u7684\u906e\u6321\u9c81\u68d2\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed8\u56fe\u76843D\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u906e\u6321\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed8\u56fe\u76843D\u52a8\u753b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u906e\u6321\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u98ce\u683c\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u7c97\u7cd9\u8f6e\u5ed3\u548c\u72ec\u7279\u7b14\u89e6\uff09\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\uff08\u5373'\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u59ff\u6001\u95f4\u9699'\uff09\u9020\u6210\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOSF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5149\u6d41\u63d0\u4f9b\u906e\u6321\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u906e\u6321\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "OSF\u5728\u906e\u6321\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53472.4\u500d\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u51cf\u5c112.1\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "OSF\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u906e\u6321\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed8\u56fe\u76843D\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Results from one-way MANOVAs, one-way ANOVAS, and\nSupport Vector Machines revealed that the LLM-generated texts differed\nsignificantly from human-written texts for each variable, with ChatGPT-o4 mini\nand -4.5 differing the most. Within these two groups, ChatGPT-4.5 demonstrated\nhigher levels of lexical diversity despite producing fewer tokens. The human\nwriters' lexical diversity did not differ across subgroups (i.e., education,\nlanguage status).

Manuscript currently under review", "summary": "Greater theorizing of methods in the computational humanities is needed for\nepistemological and interpretive clarity, and therefore the maturation of the\nfield. In this paper, we frame such modeling work as engaging in translation\nwork from a cultural, linguistic domain into a computational, mathematical\ndomain, and back again. Translators benefit from articulating the theory of\ntheir translation process, and so do computational humanists in their work --\nto ensure internal consistency, avoid subtle yet consequential translation\nerrors, and facilitate interpretive transparency. Our contribution in this\npaper is to lay out a particularly consequential dimension of the lack of\ntheorizing and the sorts of translation errors that emerge in our modeling\npractices as a result. Along these lines we introduce the idea of semiotic\ncomplexity as the degree to which the meaning of some text may vary across\ninterpretive lenses, and make the case that dominant modeling practices --\nespecially around evaluation -- commit a translation error by treating\nsemiotically complex data as semiotically simple when it seems\nepistemologically convenient by conferring superficial clarity. We then lay out\nseveral recommendations for researchers to better account for these\nepistemological issues in their own work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u547c\u5401\u52a0\u5f3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u4eba\u6587\u5b66\u79d1\u4e2d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5efa\u6a21\u5de5\u4f5c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u7406\u8bba\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u4eba\u6587\u5b66\u79d1\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7406\u8bba\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u89e3\u91ca\u900f\u660e\u6027\u548c\u9886\u57df\u6210\u719f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5efa\u6a21\u5de5\u4f5c\u89c6\u4e3a\u4ece\u6587\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u9886\u57df\u5230\u8ba1\u7b97\u6570\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7b26\u53f7\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u5efa\u6a21\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u56e0\u5ffd\u89c6\u7b26\u53f7\u590d\u6742\u6027\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u7406\u8bba\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u4f53\u5efa\u8bae\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring\nsemantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the\naudio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and\nspatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the\nsemantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded\nspatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful\ninformation can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators\nderived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or\nfrequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the\nfirst framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to\ngenerate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes\nthe generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We\nmeticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing\nspatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts\n(VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between\nthe audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop\nan efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional\nguidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video\ngeneration in a training-free manner.

We highlight several critical gaps in the field that\nindicate the need for further research: (1) the predominance of\nretrieval-focused tasks that require minimal reasoning beyond mathematical and\nlogical operations; (2) significant challenges faced by models when processing\ncomplex table structures, large-scale tables, length context, or multi-table\nscenarios; and (3) the limited generalization of models across different\ntabular representations and formats.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8868\u683c\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8868\u683c\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u8868\u683c\u56e0\u5176\u590d\u6742\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5728LLMs\u548cMLLMs\u4e2d\u5907\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u683c\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7c7b\u8868\u683c\u8f93\u5165\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u8868\u683c\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1a\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3001\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u8868\u683c\u7684\u6311\u6218\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8868\u683c\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, most\nexisting research follows the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) paradigm,\nwhich heavily depends on sequential linguistic instructions, limiting its\nscalability and autonomy. To address this gap, we introduce UAV-ON, a benchmark\nfor large-scale Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) by aerial agents in\nopen-world environments, where agents operate based on high-level semantic\ngoals without relying on detailed instructional guidance as in VLN. UAV-ON\ncomprises 14 high-fidelity Unreal Engine environments with diverse semantic\nregions and complex spatial layouts, covering urban, natural, and mixed-use\nsettings. It defines 1270 annotated target objects, each characterized by an\ninstance-level instruction that encodes category, physical footprint, and\nvisual descriptors, allowing grounded reasoning. These instructions serve as\nsemantic goals, introducing realistic ambiguity and complex reasoning\nchallenges for aerial agents. To evaluate the benchmark, we implement several\nbaseline methods, including Aerial ObjectNav Agent (AOA), a modular policy that\nintegrates instruction semantics with egocentric observations for long-horizon,\ngoal-directed exploration.

Juzek"], "title": "Model Misalignment and Language Change: Traces of AI-Associated Language in Unscripted Spoken English", "comment": "Accepted at AIES 2025. To appear in the AIES Proceedings. 14 pages, 2\n  figures, 2 tables. Licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0", "summary": "In recent years, written language, particularly in science and education, has\nundergone remarkable shifts in word usage. These changes are widely attributed\nto the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely\non a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target\naudience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are\noften linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to\ngenerate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes\nin the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a\ndataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from\nconversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends\nbefore and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated\nwords. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of\nthese words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and\nLLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no\nsignificant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of\nwords affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language\nuse.

Such \"digital twins\" are useful for simulations, virtual reality,\nmarketing, robot policy fine-tuning, and part inspection. 3D object scanning\nusually requires multi-camera arrays, precise laser scanners, or robot\nwrist-mounted cameras, which have restricted workspaces. We propose Omni-Scan,\na pipeline for producing high-quality 3D Gaussian Splat models using a\nbi-manual robot that grasps an object with one gripper and rotates the object\nwith respect to a stationary camera. The object is then re-grasped by a second\ngripper to expose surfaces that were occluded by the first gripper. We present\nthe Omni-Scan robot pipeline using DepthAny-thing, Segment Anything, as well as\nRAFT optical flow models to identify and isolate objects held by a robot\ngripper while removing the gripper and the background.

Existing methods are either ill-suited to precisely control\nhigh-dimensional upper-body joints, or difficult to ensure both robustness and\naccuracy, especially when upper-body motions are fast. This paper proposes a\nnovel time optimization policy (TOP), to train a standing manipulation control\nmodel that ensures balance, precision, and time efficiency simultaneously, with\nthe idea of adjusting the time trajectory of upper-body motions but not only\nstrengthening the disturbance resistance of the lower-body. Our approach\nconsists of three parts. Firstly, we utilize motion prior to represent\nupper-body motions to enhance the coordination ability between the upper and\nlower-body by training a variational autoencoder (VAE). Then we decouple the\nwhole-body control into an upper-body PD controller for precision and a\nlower-body RL controller to enhance robust stability. Finally, we train TOP\nmethod in conjunction with the decoupled controller and VAE to reduce the\nbalance burden resulting from fast upper-body motions that would destabilize\nthe robot and exceed the capabilities of the lower-body RL policy. The\neffectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated via both simulation and\nreal world experiments, which demonstrate the superiority on standing\nmanipulation tasks stably and accurately.

Modern LiDARs face key challenges in\nseveral real-world scenarios, such as long-distance or low-albedo objects,\nproducing sparse or erroneous point clouds.

Our adapter modifies only the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer\nblock, preserving the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Through\nsupervised experiments and ablations on the COD10K dataset as well as low-data\nsubsets of COCO and ADE20K, we show that incorporating fixed text embeddings as\ninput improves segmentation performance over purely spatial prompt baselines.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first work to use text prompts for segmentation\non the COD10K dataset. These results suggest that integrating semantic\nconditioning into SAM's architecture offers a practical and scalable path for\nefficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAM-PTx\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684CLIP\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u522b\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86SAM\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u8bed\u4e49\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4f20\u7edf\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u5982\u70b9\u548c\u6846\uff09\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u5668Parallel-Text\uff0c\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6ce8\u5165SAM\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u539f\u59cb\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u5728COD10K\u3001COCO\u548cADE20K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u56fa\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d0\u793a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u96c6\u6210\u5230SAM\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However,\nexisting work predominantly assumes the effectiveness of the demonstrations\nprovided within ICL, while many research indicates that not all demonstrations\nare effective, failing to yielding any performance improvement during ICL.\nTherefore, in this paper, we investigate the reasons behind demonstration\nineffectiveness. Our analysis is based on gradient flow and linear\nself-attention models. By setting the gradient flow to zero, we deduce that a\ndemonstration becomes ineffective if its information has either been learned by\nthe model or is irrelevant to the user query. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nin multi-layer models, the disparity in effectiveness among demonstrations is\namplified with layer increasing, causing the model to focus more on effective\nones. Considering that current demonstration selection methods primarily focus\non the relevance to the user query while overlooking the information that the\nmodel has already assimilated, we propose a novel method called GradS, which\nleverages gradient flow for demonstration selection. We use the magnitude of\nthe gradient flow of the demonstration with respect to a given user query as\nthe criterion, thereby ensuring the effectiveness of the chosen ones. We\nvalidate our derivation and GradS on four prominent LLMs across five mainstream\ndatasets.

Existing rule-based enforcement systems, such as\nAgentSpec, focus on developing reactive safety rules, which typically respond\nonly when unsafe behavior is imminent or has already occurred. These systems\nlack foresight and struggle with long-horizon dependencies and distribution\nshifts. To address these limitations, we propose Pro2Guard, a proactive runtime\nenforcement framework grounded in probabilistic reachability analysis.\nPro2Guard abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states and learns a\nDiscrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from execution traces. At runtime, it\nanticipates future risks by estimating the probability of reaching unsafe\nstates, triggering interventions before violations occur when the predicted\nrisk exceeds a user-defined threshold. By incorporating semantic validity\nchecks and leveraging PAC bounds, Pro2Guard ensures statistical reliability\nwhile approximating the underlying ground-truth model.

In this work, we propose\nFlat-LoRA and its efficient version i.e., EFlat-LoRA, to seek flat minima for\nLoRA. Concretely, we theoretically demonstrate that perturbations in the full\nparameter space can be transferred to the low-rank subspace. This approach\neliminates the potential interference introduced by perturbations across\nmultiple matrices in the low-rank subspace. Our extensive experiments on large\nlanguage models and vision-language models demonstrate that EFlat-LoRA achieves\noptimize efficiency comparable to that of LoRA while simultaneously attaining\ncomparable or even better performance. For example, on the GLUE dataset with\nRoBERTa-large, EFlat-LoRA outperforms LoRA and full fine-tuning by 1.0% and\n0.5% on average, respectively. On vision-language models e.g., Qwen-VL-Chat\nshows performance improvements of 1.5% and 1.0% on SQA and VizWiz datasets,\nrespectively. These empirical results also verify that the generalization of\nLoRA is closely related to sharpness, which is omitted by previous methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faFlat-LoRA\u548cEFlat-LoRA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bfb\u627e\u5e73\u5766\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u6765\u63d0\u5347LoRA\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfLoRA\u548c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22LoRA\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e73\u5766\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u5173\u7cfb\u7814\u7a76\u4e0a\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFlat-LoRA\u548cEFlat-LoRA\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u4f4e\u79e9\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u591a\u77e9\u9635\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5728GLUE\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cEFlat-LoRA\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eLoRA\u548c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "EFlat-LoRA\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86LoRA\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u5173\u8054\u3002"}}

Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and\nshape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in\nbiological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the\nlimited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive\nmulti-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an\nextended version of our scalable AniMer framework.

A key\ninnovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer\n(ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture\npartitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves)\nand taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and\ncommon anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical\nshortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a\ndiffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces\ntwo large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for\nbirds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for\nbirds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities.

Project page:\n  https://gwxuan.github.io/IGL-Nav/", "summary": "Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging\nproblem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or\nmodular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot\nfully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and\nthe goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image\nin 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian\n(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS\noptimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly\nleveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is\nprohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D\nGaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal\nnavigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as\nnew images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely\nlocalize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space\nmatching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent\nis close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization\nvia differentiable rendering.

However, fine-tuning with few images introduces an inherent\ntrade-off between aligning with the target distribution (e.g., subject\nfidelity) and preserving the broad knowledge of the original model (e.g., text\neditability). Existing sampling guidance methods, such as classifier-free\nguidance (CFG) and autoguidance (AG), fail to effectively guide the output\ntoward well-balanced space: CFG restricts the adaptation to the target\ndistribution, while AG compromises text alignment. To address these\nlimitations, we propose personalization guidance, a simple yet effective method\nleveraging an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt.

Most current AIG text detection datasets focus on\nzero-shot generations, but little work has been done on few-shot or one-shot\ngenerations, where LLMs are given human texts as an example. In response, we\nintroduce the Diverse Adversarial Corpus of Texts Yielded from Language models\n(DACTYL), a challenging AIG text detection dataset focusing on\none-shot/few-shot generations. We also include texts from domain-specific\ncontinued-pre-trained (CPT) language models, where we fully train all\nparameters using a memory-efficient optimization approach. Many existing AIG\ntext detectors struggle significantly on our dataset, indicating a potential\nvulnerability to one-shot/few-shot and CPT-generated texts. We also train our\nown classifiers using two approaches: standard binary cross-entropy (BCE)\noptimization and a more recent approach, deep X-risk optimization (DXO). While\nBCE-trained classifiers marginally outperform DXO classifiers on the DACTYL\ntest set, the latter excels on out-of-distribution (OOD) texts.

The unified spatio-temporal space brings two benefits,\ni.e., efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. 1) Efficient\nfeature transmission: each static object yields a single observation in the\nspatial temporal space, and thus only requires transmission only once (whereas\nprior methods re-transmit all the object features multiple times). 2) superior\nfeature fusion: merging the multi-agent and multi-time fusion into a unified\nspatial-temporal aggregation enables a more holistic perspective, thereby\nenhancing perception performance in challenging scenarios.

This design alleviates the ambiguity caused by\ninsufficient consistency information of views and ensures completeness and\nsmoothness in the reconstruction results. Secondly, we employ an\nuncertainty-guided depth constraint to back up the feature consistency loss in\nareas with occlusion and insignificant features, which recovers geometry\ndetails for better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which can produce\nhigh-quality geometry with sparse-view input, especially in the scenarios with\nsmall overlapping views.

Recent\nKGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on\nGNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation\nstrategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly\nperform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited\nadaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement,\nwhile the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate\npath evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM\ncalls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive\nMCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search\nwith adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR\nemploys a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based\nplanner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search\nspace.

To this end, we propose\nthe first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It\nintegrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based\nHand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt\nstrategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip\nRecognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand\nPrompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip\nfeatures during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction\nPhoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from\nphoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through\nsemantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS\ndataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a\nmixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nCued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios\ncompared with state-of-the-art methods.

To\naddress this, we propose DAPT, an effective PT framework based on an intuitive\ndecouple-before-align concept. First, we propose to explicitly decouple the\nvisual modality into the foreground and background representation via\nexploiting coarse-and-fine visual segmenting cues, and then both of these\ndecoupled patterns are aligned with the original foreground texts and the\nhand-crafted background classes, thereby symmetrically strengthening the modal\nalignment.

We introduce two key\ninnovations to address this challenge: i) Structured Latent Space, a\ntraining-based approach to impose a desired channel-wise structure on the\nlatent space with front latent channels capturing object structures and latter\nlatent channels capturing image details; ii) Augmented Diffusion Training, an\naugmented diffusion training strategy with additional diffusion training\nobjectives on object latent channels to accelerate convergence. With these\ntechniques, DC-AE 1.5 delivers faster convergence and better diffusion scaling\nresults than DC-AE. On ImageNet 512x512, DC-AE-1.5-f64c128 delivers better\nimage generation quality than DC-AE-f32c32 while being 4x faster.

Our experiments reveal that different LLMs\nexhibit varying levels of effectiveness in Python code generation.\nAdditionally, results show that Python code generation achieves superior\nperformance in tabular question answering compared to alternative approaches.\nAlthough our ranking among zero-shot systems is unknown at the time of this\npaper's submission, our system achieved eighth place in Subtask I and sixth\nplace in Subtask~II among the 30 systems that outperformed the baseline in the\nopen-source models category.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86SemEval-2025 Task 8\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u751f\u6210Python\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6392\u540d\u9760\u524d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u7684Python\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684Pandas\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5404\u5f02\uff0cPython\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6392\u540d\u524d\u516b\u548c\u524d\u516d\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684Python\u4ee3\u7801\u5728\u8868\u683c\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

While\nthe inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses\ninternal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given\ntask. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce\nDAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive\nLength Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models.

While recent deep learning methods have advanced lesion segmentation,\nthey primarily target large lesions and neglect valuable longitudinal and\nclinical information routinely used by radiologists. In real-world screening,\ndetecting subtle or emerging lesions requires radiologists to compare across\ntimepoints and consider previous radiology assessments, such as the BI-RADS\nscore.

Mamba, as an emerging state space model with\ninherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable\nfor processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features. However,\ndue to the particularity of underwater scenes, there are many challenges in\napplying Mamba to UIS. The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot\nmaintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of\nseverely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the\nhidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the\nunderstanding of instance objects. In this work, we propose the first\nMamba-based underwater instance segmentation model UIS-Mamba, and design two\ninnovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), to\nmigrate Mamba to the underwater task. DTS module maintains the continuity of\nthe internal features of the instance objects by allowing the patches to\ndynamically offset and scale, thereby guiding the minimum spanning tree and\nproviding dynamic local receptive fields.

Existing external safeguards fall into\ntwo types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I\nmodel-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image\nfilters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly\nand introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems\nlike Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a\nU-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1)\nearly denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2)\ncross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image\nregions.

In this paper, we propose\nHiPrune, a training-free and model-agnostic token Pruning framework that\nexploits the Hierarchical attention structure within vision encoders.

However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by\nextreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth\ndiscontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous\nmotion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and\nfail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion\nfields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We\nobserve that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion\nsub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion\npatterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in\ntwo-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework. Specifically, we first\ndevise a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition strategy that exploits inlier\nprobability signals to perform a structure-aware decomposition of the motion\nfield into heterogeneous sub-fields, sharply curbing outlier-induced bias.\nNext, we introduce an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier that enhances each\nsub-field along spatial-context and channel-semantic paths and routes it to a\ncustomized expert for targeted modeling, thereby decoupling heterogeneous\nmotion regimes, suppressing cross-sub-field interference and representational\nentanglement, and yielding fine-grained motion-field rectification. With this\nminimalist design, GeoMoE outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in\nrelative pose and homography estimation and shows strong generalization.

Through extensive evaluation, we identify key\nfactors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations,\nincluding: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and\nthe likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between\nsingle-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image\ncontexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional\nplacement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of\nobject identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we\npropose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image\nattention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention\nproportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that\nour method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic\nintegration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u8c61\u76f8\u5173\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u57fa\u51c6MIHBench\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e73\u8861\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMIHBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e73\u8861\u673a\u5236\u8c03\u6574\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6574\u5408\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u591a\u56fe\u50cfMLLMs\u4e2d\u5e7b\u89c9\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce PILOT, a framework\ndesigned to overcome these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a novel\ndual-branch prompt learning mechanism that dynamically integrates a pool of\nlearnable prompts with structured semantic attributes, enabling the model to\nadaptively weight the most relevant anomaly cues for each input image; and (2)\na label-free test-time adaptation strategy that updates the learnable prompt\nparameters using high-confidence pseudo-labels from unlabeled test data.\nExtensive experiments on 13 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that\nPILOT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and\nlocalization under domain shift.", "AI": {"tldr": "PILOT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "PILOT\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u6574\u5408\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u63d0\u793a\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u572813\u4e2a\u5de5\u4e1a\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPILOT\u5728\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "PILOT\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Using NIST's Point\nCloud City dataset (Enfield and Memphis collections), we investigate challenges\nin unifying differently labeled 3D data. Our methodology employs a graded\nschema with the KPConv architecture, evaluating performance through IoU metrics\non safety-relevant features. Results indicate performance variability:\ngeometrically large objects (e.g. stairs, windows) achieve higher segmentation\nperformance, suggesting potential for navigational context, while smaller\nsafety-critical features exhibit lower recognition rates. Performance is\nimpacted by class imbalance and the limited geometric distinction of smaller\nobjects in typical lidar scans, indicating limitations in detecting certain\nsafety-relevant features using current point-cloud methods. Key identified\nchallenges include insufficient labeled data, difficulties in unifying class\nlabels across datasets, and the need for standardization. Potential directions\ninclude automated labeling and multi-dataset learning strategies.
