At execution time, upon specifying a\nconjunction of one or more learned predicates, SymSkill uses a symbolic planner\nto compose and reorder learned skills to achieve the symbolic goals, while\nperforming recovery at both the motion and symbolic levels in real time.\nCoupled with a compliant controller, SymSkill enables safe and uninterrupted\nexecution under human and environmental disturbances. In RoboCasa simulation,\nSymSkill can execute 12 single-step tasks with 85% success rate. Without\nadditional data, it composes these skills into multi-step plans requiring up to\n6 skill recompositions, recovering robustly from execution failures. On a real\nFranka robot, we demonstrate SymSkill, learning from 5 minutes of unsegmented\nand unlabeled play data, is capable of performing multiple tasks simply by goal\nspecifications.

Considering actuator dynamics is essential for more effective and\nreliable operation, particularly during aggressive flight maneuvers or recovery\nfrom sudden disturbances. While prior studies have investigated actuator-aware\ncontrol for conventional and fixed-tilt multirotors, these approaches rely on\nlinear relationships between actuator input and wrench, which cannot capture\nthe nonlinearities induced by variable tilt angles. In this work, we exploit\nthe cascade structure between the rigid-body dynamics of the multirotor and its\nnonlinear actuator dynamics to design the proposed backstepping controller and\nestablish exponential stability of the overall system. Furthermore, we reveal\nparametric uncertainty in the actuator model through experiments, and we\ndemonstrate that the proposed controller remains robust against such\nuncertainty. The controller was compared against a baseline that does not\naccount for actuator dynamics across three experimental scenarios: fast\ntranslational tracking, rapid rotational tracking, and recovery from sudden\ndisturbance. The proposed method consistently achieved better tracking\nperformance, and notably, while the baseline diverged and crashed during the\nfastest translational trajectory tracking and the recovery experiment, the\nproposed controller maintained stability and successfully completed the tasks,\nthereby demonstrating its effectiveness."}

To mitigate the effect of simulator inductive\nbias, the key idea is to train policies jointly across multiple simulators,\nencouraging the learned controller to capture dynamics that generalize beyond\nany single simulator's assumptions.

Leveraging FalconGym 2.0's editability, we propose a\nPerformance-Guided Refinement (PGR) algorithm, which concentrates visual\npolicy's training on challenging tracks while iteratively improving its\nperformance. Across two case studies (fixed-wing UAVs and quadrotors) with\ndistinct dynamics and environments, we show that a single visual policy trained\nwith PGR in FalconGym 2.0 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in\ngeneralization and robustness: it generalizes to three unseen tracks with 100%\nsuccess without per-track retraining and maintains higher success rates under\ngate-pose perturbations. Finally, we demonstrate that the visual policy trained\nwith PGR in FalconGym 2.0 can be zero-shot sim-to-real transferred to a\nquadrotor hardware, achieving a 98.6% success rate (69 / 70 gates) over 30\ntrials spanning two three-gate tracks and a moving-gate track."}

Current approaches\naddress this gap by retargeting human motion data to humanoid embodiments and\nthen training reinforcement learning (RL) policies to imitate these reference\ntrajectories. However, artifacts introduced during retargeting, such as foot\nsliding, self-penetration, and physically infeasible motion are often left in\nthe reference trajectories for the RL policy to correct. While prior work has\ndemonstrated motion tracking abilities, they often require extensive reward\nengineering and domain randomization to succeed. In this paper, we\nsystematically evaluate how retargeting quality affects policy performance when\nexcessive reward tuning is suppressed. To address issues that we identify with\nexisting retargeting methods, we propose a new retargeting method, General\nMotion Retargeting (GMR). We evaluate GMR alongside two open-source\nretargeters, PHC and ProtoMotions, as well as with a high-quality closed-source\ndataset from Unitree. Using BeyondMimic for policy training, we isolate\nretargeting effects without reward tuning. Our experiments on a diverse subset\nof the LAFAN1 dataset reveal that while most motions can be tracked, artifacts\nin retargeted data significantly reduce policy robustness, particularly for\ndynamic or long sequences. GMR consistently outperforms existing open-source\nmethods in both tracking performance and faithfulness to the source motion,\nachieving perceptual fidelity and policy success rates close to the\nclosed-source baseline.

View-Invariant Policy Learning with Camera Conditioning", "comment": "Code and project materials are available at\n  ripl.github.io/know_your_camera", "summary": "We study view-invariant imitation learning by explicitly conditioning\npolicies on camera extrinsics. Using Plucker embeddings of per-pixel rays, we\nshow that conditioning on extrinsics significantly improves generalization\nacross viewpoints for standard behavior cloning policies, including ACT,\nDiffusion Policy, and SmolVLA. To evaluate policy robustness under realistic\nviewpoint shifts, we introduce six manipulation tasks in RoboSuite and\nManiSkill that pair \"fixed\" and \"randomized\" scene variants, decoupling\nbackground cues from camera pose. Our analysis reveals that policies without\nextrinsics often infer camera pose using visual cues from static backgrounds in\nfixed scenes; this shortcut collapses when workspace geometry or camera\nplacement shifts. Conditioning on extrinsics restores performance and yields\nrobust RGB-only control without depth. We release the tasks, demonstrations,\nand code at https://ripl.github.io/know_your_camera/ ."}

However, pretrained policies usually perform poorly without\nsufficient in-domain data. Besides, human-collected demonstrations entail\nsubstantial labour and tend to encompass mixed-quality data and redundant\ninformation. As a workaround, human-in-the-loop systems gather domain-specific\ndata for policy post-training, and exploit closed-loop policy feedback to offer\ninformative guidance, but usually require full-time human surveillance during\npolicy rollout. In this work, we devise ARMADA, a multi-robot deployment and\nadaptation system with human-in-the-loop shared control, featuring an\nautonomous online failure detection method named FLOAT. Thanks to FLOAT, ARMADA\nenables paralleled policy rollout and requests human intervention only when\nnecessary, significantly reducing reliance on human supervision. Hence, ARMADA\nenables efficient acquisition of in-domain data, and leads to more scalable\ndeployment and faster adaptation to new scenarios. We evaluate the performance\nof ARMADA on four real-world tasks. FLOAT achieves nearly 95% accuracy on\naverage, surpassing prior state-of-the-art failure detection approaches by over\n20%. Besides, ARMADA manifests more than 4$\\times$ increase in success rate and\ngreater than 2$\\times$ reduction in human intervention rate over multiple\nrounds of policy rollout and post-training, compared to previous\nhuman-in-the-loop learning methods."}
