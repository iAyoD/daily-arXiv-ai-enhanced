Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMMKD是一个多模态多教师知识蒸馏框架，通过特征融合、多教师蒸馏和自适应优化，实现了轻量高效的图像文本检索模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉语言预训练模型在移动设备部署受限，主要由于模型尺寸大和计算复杂度高，需要开发轻量级但有效的检索模型。

Method: 采用多模态特征融合网络提取图像和文本特征，设计多教师知识蒸馏框架预训练两个CLIP教师模型，使用KL散度进行概率分布匹配，并设计自适应动态权重方案处理多目标优化问题。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，AMMKD在显著降低模型复杂度的同时实现了优越性能。

Conclusion: AMMKD框架有效解决了移动设备部署问题，验证了其有效性和灵活性，为轻量级多模态检索提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The success of large-scale visual language pretraining (VLP) models has
driven widespread adoption of image-text retrieval tasks. However, their
deployment on mobile devices remains limited due to large model sizes and
computational complexity. We propose Adaptive Multi-Modal Multi-Teacher
Knowledge Distillation (AMMKD), a novel framework that integrates multi-modal
feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to
deliver lightweight yet effective retrieval models. Specifically, our method
begins with a feature fusion network that extracts and merges discriminative
features from both the image and text modalities. To reduce model parameters
and further improve performance, we design a multi-teacher knowledge
distillation framework to pre-train two CLIP teacher models. We decouple
modalities by pre-computing and storing text features as class vectors via the
teacher text encoder to enhance efficiency. To better align teacher and student
outputs, we apply KL scatter for probability distribution matching. Finally, we
design an adaptive dynamic weighting scheme that treats multi-teacher
distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem. By leveraging gradient
space diversity, we dynamically adjust the influence of each teacher, reducing
conflicts and guiding the student toward more optimal learning directions.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMMKD
achieves superior performance while significantly reducing model complexity,
validating its effectiveness and flexibility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出创新的二维可持续性评估系统FMS和ASC指标，在多模态任务中验证了其普适性，为绿色AI研究提供量化评估基础


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型训练产生高碳排放问题，平衡算法性能与能耗的核心挑战

Method: 提出可持续调和平均数(FMS)和可持续曲线下面积(ASC)两个量化指标，构建多模态任务基准测试

Result: 实验证明该系统能为跨任务算法评估提供量化依据，推动绿色AI研究从理论走向实践

Conclusion: 该可持续性评估框架为行业建立算法能效标准提供方法论支持，促进AI可持续发展

Abstract: This work focuses on the high carbon emissions generated by deep learning
model training, specifically addressing the core challenge of balancing
algorithm performance and energy consumption. It proposes an innovative
two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the
traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study
pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio
and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy
consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the
algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the
sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to
characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout
the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study
constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning.
Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for
evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI
research from theory to practice. Our sustainability evaluation framework code
can be found here, providing methodological support for the industry to
establish algorithm energy efficiency standards.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MESTI新型动态输入模态和MEGANet网络，通过梯度注意力机制提升微表情识别性能，在多个数据集上达到最先进水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统输入模态（Apex Frame、光流、动态图像）难以捕捉微表情的细微短暂特征，导致识别性能不佳

Method: 开发MESTI将视频序列转换为单张图像保留微运动特征；设计MEGANet网络包含梯度注意力块增强细粒度运动特征提取

Result: 在CASMEII和SAMM数据集上达到最高准确率，MESTI替换现有网络输入能持续提升性能，建立新的性能基准

Conclusion: MESTI是优越的输入模态，MEGANet是先进的识别网络，为更有效的微表情识别系统铺平道路

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task due to the subtle
and fleeting nature of micro-expressions. Traditional input modalities, such as
Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture
these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this
study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel
dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image
while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements.
Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network
(MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the
extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining
MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER.
Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI,
comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures
(VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing
the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent
performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and
Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves
state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of
MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new
benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the
potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced
recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety
of applications.

### [6] [Scaffold Diffusion: Sparse Multi-Category Voxel Structure Generation with Discrete Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00062)
*Justin Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scaffold Diffusion是一个用于生成稀疏多类别3D体素结构的生成模型，使用离散扩散语言模型处理体素作为token，在98%稀疏度的数据上仍能生成真实连贯的结构


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D体素结构生成中立方内存扩展和类别不平衡的问题，特别是处理高稀疏度数据时的挑战

Method: 将体素视为token，使用离散扩散语言模型生成3D体素结构，扩展了离散扩散模型在空间连贯3D结构生成中的应用

Result: 在Minecraft房屋结构数据集上评估，相比基线方法和自回归模型，能够生成更真实和连贯的结构，即使训练数据稀疏度超过98%

Conclusion: 离散扩散为3D稀疏体素生成建模提供了一个有前景的框架，能够有效处理高稀疏度数据的生成问题

Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult
due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the
significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold
Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel
structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete
diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete
diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains
such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on
Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that,
unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion
produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over
98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize
generated samples and the generation process. Our results highlight discrete
diffusion as a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling.

### [7] [Dual-Stage Global and Local Feature Framework for Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00108)
*Anas M. Ali,Anis Koubaa,Bilel Benjdira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SGLC框架解决高分辨率图像去雾问题，通过全局特征生成器和局部特征增强器的组合，在保持全局上下文的同时增强局部细节，显著提升PSNR指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去雾模型在处理高分辨率图像时性能下降严重，主要原因是难以有效结合全局上下文信息和局部精细细节，需要新的方法来应对这一挑战

Method: SGLC框架包含两个主要组件：全局特征生成器(GFG)负责场景的全局理解生成初步去雾结果，局部特征增强器(LFE)随后细化局部细节和像素级特征，实现全局外观与局部结构的交互

Result: 在高分辨率数据集上的实验表明，SGLC显著提升了峰值信噪比(PSNR)，证明其在大规模雾化图像处理中的有效性

Conclusion: SGLC设计具有模型无关性，可以与任何去雾网络结合，通过全局-局部特征融合机制同时利用场景级线索和细节信息，显著提高高分辨率环境下的视觉保真度

Abstract: Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital
images, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in
the computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have
demonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated
high-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to
downsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads
to a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the
difficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with
localized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this
chapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local
Features Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for
high-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:
the Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The
GFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual
understanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary
output by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby
capturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To
evaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer
architecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on
high-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in
addressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is
model-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed
global-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners
can harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving
visual fidelity in high-resolution environments.

### [8] [Self-supervised large-scale kidney abnormality detection in drug safety assessment studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00131)
*Ivan Slootweg,Natalia P. García-De-La-Puente,Geert Litjens,Salma Dammak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了首个大规模自监督异常检测模型用于肾脏毒理病理学，通过自监督方法在UNI基础模型特征上实现了优于随机水平的异常检测性能，可帮助排除正常切片从而降低药物开发成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肾脏异常检测是临床前药物开发的关键环节，但传统方法需要人工检查数百至数千张全切片图像，耗时耗力且大部分图像都是正常的。需要自动化方法来提高效率。

Method: 使用来自158种化合物的药物安全性评估研究数据，探索基于UNI基础模型特征提取的异常检测方法。比较了简单的k近邻分类器和自监督方法在相同特征上的表现。

Result: k近邻分类器表现与随机水平相当，表明仅使用基础模型特征不足以检测异常。而自监督方法在相同特征上实现了AUC 0.62和89%的阴性预测值，优于随机水平。

Conclusion: 自监督方法在肾脏异常检测方面显示出潜力，经过进一步开发可用于药物安全性评估中排除正常切片，显著降低药物开发的时间和成本。

Abstract: Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug
development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to
thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are
normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study,
we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model
for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from
158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on
this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show
that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at
chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for
detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method
applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a
negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be
used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the
costs and time associated with drug development.

Conclusion: 研究强调了进一步提升VLLMs在复杂环境中鲁棒性的迫切需求，为未来模型改进提供了重要见解和基准数据集。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for
Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) capable of performing a wide range of
visual understanding tasks. While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance
on standard natural images, their capabilities have not been thoroughly
explored in cluttered datasets where there is complex environment having
deformed shaped objects. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset
specifically designed for waste classification in real-world scenarios,
characterized by complex environments and deformed shaped objects. Along with
this dataset, we present an in-depth evaluation approach to rigorously assess
the robustness and accuracy of VLLMs. The introduced dataset and comprehensive
analysis provide valuable insights into the performance of VLLMs under
challenging conditions. Our findings highlight the critical need for further
advancements in VLLM's robustness to perform better in complex environments.
The dataset and code for our experiments will be made publicly available.

*Faizan Farooq Khan,Vladan Stojnić,Zakaria Laskar,Mohamed Elhoseiny,Giorgos Tolias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种通过生成式模型将文本查询转换为视觉查询，结合多模态分数融合的文本-图像检索方法，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然CLIP等视觉-语言模型提供了开放词汇的文本-图像检索方案，但文本和图像在表征空间中存在显著的模态间距，限制了检索性能。

Method: 采用两步接近：先通过生成模型将文本查询转换为视觉查询，然后使用视觉模型评估图像-图像相似性。还包含聚合网络来结合多个生成图像的表征，并融合不同查询模态的相似性分数。

Result: 经过大量评估，该方法在文本-图像检索任务上持续超越仅依靠文本查询的检索方法。

Conclusion: 通过涉及视觉编码器、视觉-语言模型和文本-图像生成模型的多模态方法，可以有效缩小文本和图像间的模态间距，显著提升检索效果。

Abstract: This work explores text-to-image retrieval for queries that specify or
describe a semantic category. While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP
offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to
distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To
bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform
the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we
estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we
introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a
single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query
modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and
text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it
consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

*Younggun Kim,Sirnam Swetha,Fazil Kagdi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了PRISM基准测试和Safe-LLaVA数据集，用于评估和减少多模态大语言模型中的生物特征信息泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理视觉语言任务时，即使未被明确要求，也会推断并泄露敏感的生物特征信息（如种族、性别、年龄等），这在现实应用和社会敏感领域中存在严重的隐私风险。目前缺乏公开的数据集和基准来全面评估或缓解这种生物特征泄露问题。

Method: 1) 引入PRISM基准测试，评估模型在两个方面的表现：拒绝生物特征相关查询和在保持语义忠实度的同时避免一般响应中的隐式生物特征泄露；2) 对广泛使用的LLaVA数据集进行详细审计，发现预训练和指令数据中存在大量生物特征泄露；3) 开发Safe-LLaVA数据集，通过系统性地从LLaVA数据集中移除显式和隐式生物特征信息来构建首个隐私保护的多模态大语言模型训练数据集。

Result: 1) PRISM基准测试揭示了不同多模态大语言模型在各种生物特征属性上的泄露情况，详细展示了隐私违规行为；2) 在Safe-LLaVA数据集上微调的模型显著减少了生物特征泄露；3) 提供了公开可用的Safe-LLaVA数据集和PRISM基准测试。

Conclusion: Safe-LLaVA和PRISM共同为多模态大语言模型的隐私对齐开发和评估设立了新标准，为解决模型中的生物特征信息泄露问题提供了有效的解决方案和评估框架。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and
reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight,
and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This
raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and
socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available
dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric
leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware
Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to
assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2)
implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic
faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA
datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and
instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first
privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing
explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations
on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes,
highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on
Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric
leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA & PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned
development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset & PRISM benchmark
are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kyh9191/Safe-LLaVA,
and the source code is available at

TL;DR: VEME是一种新颖的跨模态对齐方法，通过构建自我中心的世界模型来增强视觉语言模型在动态环境中的时空推理和泛化能力，在导航和问答任务上取得1%-3%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在静态场景理解表现出色，但在动态开放环境中的时空推理和适应性方面存在局限，特别是在任务导向导航和具身问答等任务中，对细粒度时空线索和物理世界理解不足。

Method: 提出VEME框架，包含三个核心组件：1）跨模态对齐框架连接对象、空间表征和视觉语义；2）动态隐式认知地图实现任务相关的几何-语义记忆召回；3）基于指令的导航推理框架利用具身先验进行长期规划和高效探索。

Result: 在VSI-Bench和VLN-CE基准测试中，相比传统方法实现了1%-3%的准确率和探索效率提升，显著改善了动态环境中的推理和规划能力。

Conclusion: 通过嵌入几何感知的时空经验，VEME方法有效增强了视觉语言模型在未知动态环境中的泛化能力和推理性能，为具身智能发展提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in
unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence.
While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene
understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to
dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question
answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained
spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we
propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization
in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model.
Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment
framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with
spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic,
implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant
geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and
reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and
efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic
experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in
dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate
1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 叶状肿瘤在影像学上与良性纤维腺瘤相似，术前分类困难，常导致不必要的手术切除，需要开发更准确的诊断方法

Method: 开发双分支神经网络，从81例确诊患者的超声图像和临床数据中提取并融合特征，采用类别感知采样和分层5折交叉验证防止类别不平衡和数据泄露

Conclusion: 多模态AI有潜力作为非侵入性诊断工具，减少不必要活检，改善乳腺肿瘤管理的临床决策

Abstract: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are
difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to
benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To
address this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates
breast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve
diagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts
and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects
with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold
cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The
results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines
in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image
encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal
setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and
0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to
serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and
improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

Space and Time (LSST) is predicted to find O(10^5) gravitational lenses over
the next decade, demanding automated classifiers. In this work, we introduce
GraViT, a PyTorch pipeline for gravitational lens detection that leverages
extensive pretraining of state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) models and
MLP-Mixer. We assess the impact of transfer learning on classification
performance by examining data quality (source and sample size), model
architecture (selection and fine-tuning), training strategies (augmentation,
normalization, and optimization), and ensemble predictions. This study
reproduces the experiments in a previous systematic comparison of neural
networks and provides insights into the detectability of strong gravitational
lenses on that common test sample. We fine-tune ten architectures using
datasets from HOLISMOKES VI and SuGOHI X, and benchmark them against
convolutional baselines, discussing complexity and inference-time analysis.

### [15] [A High-Accuracy Fast Hough Transform with Linear-Log-Cubed Computational Complexity for Arbitrary-Shaped Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00231)
*Danil Kazimirov,Dmitry Nikolaev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FHT2SP算法，在保持恒定有界误差的同时实现近最优计算复杂度，解决了传统快速Hough变换算法在精度和效率之间的权衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有快速Hough变换算法要么计算复杂度最优但精度随尺度恶化，要么精度恒定但计算成本接近立方复杂度，需要找到两者平衡的解决方案

Method: 基于Brady的超像素概念，将其扩展到任意形状（超越原始幂次方约束），并集成到FHT2DT算法中，通过适当选择超像素大小来控制精度和效率

Result: FHT2SP算法实现了近最优计算复杂度O(wh ln³ w)，同时保持与图像大小无关的恒定有界近似误差，可通过元参数控制误差

Conclusion: FHT2SP算法成功解决了Hough变换中计算复杂度和精度之间的权衡问题，为各种应用提供了快速且高精度的解决方案

Abstract: The Hough transform (HT) is a fundamental tool across various domains, from
classical image analysis to neural networks and tomography. Two key aspects of
the algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and
accuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous
lines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms
with optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for
power-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$
extend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that
worsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded
error but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$
algorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our
development of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes
beyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the
$FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an
image of shape $w \times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal
computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(wh \ln^3 w)$, while keeping the
approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, and
controllable via a meta-parameter. We provide theoretical and experimental
analyses of the algorithm's complexity and accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种语言引导的生成式视觉系统，用于制造业残留轮廓检测，通过条件GAN和视觉语言建模实现CAD级精度，在FabTrack数据集上提升了轮廓保真度和几何对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业计算机视觉系统常受噪声、材料变异和不受控成像条件影响，传统边缘检测器和手工流程效果有限，需要更精确的解决方案。

Method: 三阶段系统：数据采集与预处理、条件GAN轮廓生成、基于视觉语言模型的多模态轮廓细化，采用人机协作的标准提示词工程。

Result: 在FabTrack数据集上提高了轮廓保真度，增强了边缘连续性和几何对齐，减少了手动追踪。GPT-image-1在标准化条件下在结构准确性和感知质量上均优于Gemini 2.0 Flash。

Conclusion: VLM引导的生成式工作流程有望突破传统管道的限制，推动工业计算机视觉的发展。

Abstract: Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material
variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of
classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a
language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in
manufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized
into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using
a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language
modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process
and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack
datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge
continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the
refinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including
Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided
workflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1
consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and
perceptual quality. These findings demonstrate the promise of VLM-guided
generative workflows for advancing industrial computer vision beyond the
limitations of classical pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出LIMO方法，结合信息论和参数高效微调技术，在transductive few-shot learning中显著提升CLIP模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前transductive few-shot learning主要关注纯视觉模型，在视觉-语言基础模型领域研究较少，需要针对VLMs的专门方法

Method: 提出LIMO损失函数，包含三个互补项：视觉输入与文本类别描述的互信息、KL散度惩罚项、基于标注样本的标准交叉熵损失；探索参数高效微调策略

Result: LIMO大幅超越近期transductive few-shot CLIP方法，相比最佳inductive方法也有显著提升

Conclusion: 信息论方法和参数高效微调在transductive few-shot setting中具有巨大潜力，仅调整模型参数子集即可获得性能大幅提升

Abstract: Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing
on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent
context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent
methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs
and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we
leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive
transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three
complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and
the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the
text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss
based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed
fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and
explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly,
we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of
adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot
setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms
the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields
significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MorphGen是一种通过显式建模细胞核形态和空间组织来提高组织病理学图像域泛化能力的方法，结合监督对比学习和随机权重平均技术，能够抵抗染色伪影和领域偏移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织病理学全切片图像存在机构间差异（组织制备、染色、成像条件），而病理学家依赖领域不变的形态学特征进行诊断。受此启发，研究旨在学习对领域偏移具有鲁棒性的癌症表征。

Method: 提出MorphGen方法：1）整合组织病理学图像、增强技术和细胞核分割掩码；2）在监督对比学习框架中对齐图像和细胞核掩码的潜在表示；3）结合随机权重平均（SWA）技术寻找更平坦的最小值以增强泛化能力。

Result: 注意力图分析显示MorphGen主要依赖核形态、细胞组成和空间细胞组织进行分类。该方法对图像损坏（如染色伪影）和对抗攻击表现出韧性，不仅实现了OOD泛化，还解决了数字病理学深度学习系统的关键脆弱性。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模生物学上鲁棒的核形态和空间组织，MorphGen能够学习到对领域偏移具有抵抗力的癌症表征，为计算组织病理学的域泛化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by
heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue
preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike
machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological
cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia,
chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal
architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain
diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that
explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial
organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are
resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided
Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations,
and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning
framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks,
MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological
atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific
features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate
stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima.
Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear
morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors
or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience
of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining
artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but
also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for
digital pathology. Code, datasets, and trained models are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种专门针对视觉到床的互信息基于的视觉token剪枝策略，通过保持跨模态对齐和模态内信息多样性，在减少88.9%token的情况下仍能保持性能，并实现了56.7%的推理速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型中视觉token序列会导致计算和内存成本显著增加，现有的token剪枝方法存在成本高或重要性评估不优的问题，导致保留了过多的冗余token。

Method: 首先分析视视和文本到床的冗余性差异，专门针对视觉token进行剪枝。提出互信息基于的token剪枝策略，移除与文本到床语义不对齐的视觉token，保持跨模态对齐。通过购式算法最大化保留token在嵌入空间中的预期成对距离，保持模态内信息多样性。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和LLaVA-NEXT-7B等模型上，方法能够减少88.9%的token数量，同时保持了强劲的性能表现，实现了推理速度56.7%的提升。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的视觉token剪枝策略通过合理的重要性评估，有效减少了计算资源消耗，为大型多模态模型的高效推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across
various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token
sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly
processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially
raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has
emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning
methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics,
leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy
differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively
on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy
that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal
informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning
strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual
tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual
modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained
tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the
expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently
with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as
LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference
speed.

Conclusion: CryptoFace将为需要强大可证明安全性的安全人脸识别系统提供支持

Abstract: Face recognition is central to many authentication, security, and
personalized applications. Yet, it suffers from significant privacy risks,
particularly arising from unauthorized access to sensitive biometric data. This
paper introduces CryptoFace, the first end-to-end encrypted face recognition
system with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It enables secure processing of
facial data across all stages of a face-recognition process--feature
extraction, storage, and matching--without exposing raw images or features. We
introduce a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to support
higher-dimensional tensors via patch-based processing while reducing the
multiplicative depth and, thus, inference latency. Parallel FHE evaluation of
these networks ensures near-resolution-independent latency. On standard face
recognition benchmarks, CryptoFace significantly accelerates inference and
increases verification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art FHE neural
networks adapted for face recognition. CryptoFace will facilitate secure face
recognition systems requiring robust and provable security. The code is

Conclusion: 大量实验验证了该融合方法的优越性、可靠性和稳定性，为实时图像融合应用提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Current advanced research on infrared and visible image fusion primarily
focuses on improving fusion performance, often neglecting the applicability on
real-time fusion devices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
towards extremely fast fusion via distillation to learnable lookup tables
specifically designed for image fusion, termed as LUT-Fuse. Firstly, we develop
a look-up table structure that utilizing low-order approximation encoding and
high-level joint contextual scene encoding, which is well-suited for
multi-modal fusion. Moreover, given the lack of ground truth in multi-modal
image fusion, we naturally proposed the efficient LUT distillation strategy
instead of traditional quantization LUT methods. By integrating the performance
of the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) into the MM-LUT model, our method
achieves significant breakthroughs in efficiency and performance. It typically
requires less than one-tenth of the time compared to the current lightweight
SOTA fusion algorithms, ensuring high operational speed across various
scenarios, even in low-power mobile devices. Extensive experiments validate the
superiority, reliability, and stability of our fusion approach. The code is

Motivation: 现有的单域游移方法忽视了一个容易获取的资源：目标部署环境的文本描述。这些文本元数据在实际应用中常见但被忽视，可以在严重数据限制下显著提升模型的通用性。

Method: 提出STAR模块：1) 使用目标描述的文本嵌入构建目标锚定子空间；2) 将源图像特征向目标域重定中；3) 通过谱投影保留与目标线索对齐的方向，废弃源特定噪音；4) 使用视觉-语言蒸馈对齐背榜特征与VLM的语义几何；5) 采用特征空间Mixup确保源与目标表示之间的平滑迁移。

Result: 在多个图像分类和物体检测标准数据集上的实验证明，STAR方法显示出优势性能。证明最小化的文本元数据可以在严重数据限制下显著提升模型的通用性。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了一种新的思路：实用且常被忽视的文本元数据可以在无法获取目标域数据的情况下，显著提升模型在未见数据环境中的部署稳健性，为在目标环境中部署稳健模型打开了新途径。

Abstract: Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically
under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization
(SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning
invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual
descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented
Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the
textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to
guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget
Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into
source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR
uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target
description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then
utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues
while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language
distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR
further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source
and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image
classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority.
This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and
often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe
data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target
environments with unseen data.

achieving up to 92.02% classification accuracy and an RMSE of 7.70 with the
EfficientNet-B0 backbone. The model delivers an 18.5% improvement over
single-modality approaches while maintaining low computational overhead, making
it suitable for deployment on edge devices. AQFusionNet provides a scalable and

Motivation: 高光谱图像去噪是后续任务的关键预处理步骤。干净的HSI通常存在于低维子空间中，但如何充分使用这种物理特性进行有效去噪同时保留图像细节是一个挑战。

Method: 在U-Net架构中嵌入秩最小化模块(RMM)，将特征图变换到小波域并对低频分量应用奇异值阈值处理(SVT)，通过自适应学习参数来灵活捕捉不同场景下的低秩性，并采用迭代细化过程自适应结合中间去噪结果和噪声输入。

Result: 实验结果表明ILRNet在合成和真实世界噪声去除任务中都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ILRNet成功整合了模型驱动和数据驱动方法的优势，通过特征域中的低秩约束和迭代细化过程，实现了高效的高光谱图像去噪和细节保留。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for
subsequent tasks. The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace,
which can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the
physical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such
physical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details.
This paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address
these challenges. ILRNet integrates the strengths of model-driven and
data-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module (RMM) within a
U-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain
and applies singular value thresholding (SVT) to the low-frequency components
during the forward pass, leveraging the spectral low-rankness of HSIs in the
feature domain. The parameter, closely related to the hyperparameter of the
singular vector thresholding algorithm, is adaptively learned from the data,
allowing for flexible and effective capture of low-rankness across different
scenarios. Additionally, ILRNet features an iterative refinement process that
adaptively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with noisy inputs. This manner
ensures progressive enhancement and superior preservation of image details.
Experimental results demonstrate that ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted
Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two
major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and
insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development
of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an
effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video
understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness.
Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise
Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video
encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video
Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate
surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware
Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved
multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of
surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble
to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM.
Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks,
including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness
of our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding. The source code is

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的视觉-语义注意力势场框架，揭示了多模态大语言模型中物体幻觉的两种不同成因：遗漏幻觉源于视觉特征映射到语言表达的信心不足，而虚构幻觉则来自跨模态表示空间中的虚假关联。基于此提出了VPFC方法，有效减少遗漏幻觉而不增加虚构幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法错误地假设遗漏和虚构幻觉有共同原因，往往减少遗漏却引发更多虚构。本文旨在推翻这一观点，揭示两种幻觉的不同成因机制。

Method: 通过视觉注意力干预实验，提出视觉-语义注意力势场概念框架，并开发了即插即用的视觉势场校准(VPFC)方法来缓解幻觉问题。

Result: VPFC方法能够有效减少遗漏幻觉，同时不会引入额外的虚构幻觉，为幻觉缓解提供了更平衡的解决方案。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前物体幻觉研究的关键疏忽，为开发更鲁棒和平衡的幻觉缓解策略指明了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive advances,
yet object hallucination remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods,
based on the flawed assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations
share a common cause, often reduce omissions only to trigger more fabrications.
In this work, we overturn this view by demonstrating that omission
hallucinations arise from insufficient confidence when mapping perceived visual
features to linguistic expressions, whereas fabrication hallucinations result
from spurious associations within the cross-modal representation space due to
statistical biases in the training corpus. Building on findings from visual
attention intervention experiments, we propose the Visual-Semantic Attention
Potential Field, a conceptual framework that reveals how the model constructs
visual evidence to infer the presence or absence of objects. Leveraging this
insight, we introduce Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a
plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that effectively reduces omission
hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations. Our
findings reveal a critical oversight in current object hallucination research
and chart new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination
mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: SPO-VLM是一个针对视觉语言模型的两阶段防御框架，通过激活干预和策略优化来增强模型对抗对抗攻击的鲁棒性，同时保持视觉理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs容易受到对抗攻击，而现有的激活引导防御方法依赖任务特定的对比提示，性能不佳且可能降低视觉定位能力

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段计算自适应层特定引导向量来抑制有害行为；第二阶段通过序列级偏好优化进行细化，整合毒性评估和视觉一致性奖励

Result: 实验表明SPO-VLM能有效增强安全性，对抗攻击，同时在良性任务上保持强性能且不损害视觉理解能力

Conclusion: SPO-VLM通过结合激活级干预和策略级优化，提供了高效且有效的防御方案，平衡了效率和效果

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but
remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has
emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific
contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal
performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these
limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM
(\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines
activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model
robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering
vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful
behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering
vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage
integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards
based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded
text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and
effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with
deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM
enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference
optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without
compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model
weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research.

*Mengke Li,Lihao Chen,Peng Zhang,Yiu-ming Cheung,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该文章提出了适配性点提示调整(APPT)方法，通过直接利用点特征来调整异构基础模型，以高效地进行3D点云分析，避免了传统的"高到低"映射方法导致的空间几何信息丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于点云数据的稀缺，预训练大型3D模型面临挑战。虽然有些方法尝试将预训练视觉模型应用于3D领域，但这些方法导致空间几何信息丢失，且缺乏通用性框架。因此需要一种直接利用点特征来调整异构基础模型的方法。

Method: 提出APPT方法：1)将原始点云转换为点嵌入表示，通过聚合局部几何特征和线性层来捕捉空间特征；2)使用排列不变特征来捕捉点嵌入的相对位置，获得含位置信息的点标志；3)通过与点嵌入模块共享权重的提示生成器动态生成点提示，调整自注意力机制并补偿异构数据的结构上下文缺失。

Result: APPT方法能够以较少的参数量完成预训练模型的微调，实现直接的点云处理，避免了异构映射。该方法能够捕捉空间特征并优化自注意力机制，同时减少计算开销。

Conclusion: APPT提供了一种通用的框架，能够将任意模态的预训练基础模型适配到3D点云分析任务，保留了空间几何信息，并通过动态提示生成来补偿异构数据的结构上下文缺失，为3D点云分析提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for foundation models in 1D
textual and 2D visual analysis have demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However,
due to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a
challenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual
models to 3D domains through "high-to-low" mapping, these approaches often lead
to the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for
adapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly
leverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any
modality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive
Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a
modest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without
heterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by
aggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear
layers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the
inherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of
images and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the
relative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched
with location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate
self-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce
computational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights
with the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without
adding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen
foundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating
for the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.

TL;DR: 提出NoiseCutMix方法，将CutMix概念引入扩散模型，通过融合两个不同类别的估计噪声来生成自然、高分辨率的多类别融合图像，用于数据增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CutMix等方法在融合多类别图像时会产生不自然的边界，而扩散模型能够生成自然高分辨率图像，因此希望结合两者的优势来创建更自然的数据增强样本。

Method: 在扩散模型的噪声估计阶段，部分融合两个不同类别对应的估计噪声，从而生成具有两个类别融合特征的自然图像。

Result: 在分类实验中验证了方法的有效性，相比传统多类别融合数据增强方法和随机图像生成方法表现更好。

Conclusion: NoiseCutMix成功实现了自然、高分辨率的多类别图像融合生成，为数据增强提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method that introduces
the concept of CutMix into the generation process of diffusion models, thereby
exploiting both the ability of diffusion models to generate natural and
high-resolution images and the characteristic of CutMix, which combines
features from two classes to create diverse augmented data. Representative data
augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix
and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries
between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study,
we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution
image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by
partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes
in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the
effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data
augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation
using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods. Our codes are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D LiDAR点云语义分割需要大量标注数据，成本高昂且耗时，而现实世界图像数据集丰富易得，希望通过跨模态知识蒸馏减少3D标注需求

Method: 使用预训练2D图像模型处理未标注2D数据，通过已知的2D-3D对应关系进行跨模态知识蒸馏，在3D点云上部署自校准卷积作为域适应模块基础，保持模态通用信息同时过滤模态特定细节

Result: 实验验证了所提方法的有效性，性能持续超越该领域最先进方法

Conclusion: 提出的跨模态知识蒸馏方法成功实现了无需3D标注的LiDAR点云语义分割，为自动驾驶场景的3D感知提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point
cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast,
realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To
mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two
crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge
Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally
synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we
directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through
crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively
align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D
network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on
preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific
details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy
self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain
adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统叙事分析需要研究人员将各种数据转化为手写叙事故事，给研究者和参与者带来沉重负担，需要更高效、参与者友好的叙事制作和呈现方法。

Method: 开发NAME范式，包含演员定位和形状模块以促进合理图像生成，设计包含三个关键维度的评估指标来客观衡量生成角色的感知质量和叙事一致性。

Result: 在不同数据划分方案下均达到最先进性能：仅用0.96%数据就将FID分数从195降至152；相同数据量下，70:30划分FID从175降至152，95:5划分从96降至49；新指标得分3.62超越基线2.66。

Conclusion: NAME范式成功减轻了叙事分析中的认知负担，为叙事探究领域提供了更高效、参与者友好的解决方案，在数据效率和生成质量方面都表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Narrative inquiry has been one of the prominent application domains for the
analysis of human experience, aiming to know more about the complexity of human
society. However, researchers are often required to transform various forms of
data into coherent hand-drafted narratives in storied form throughout narrative
analysis, which brings an immense burden of data analysis. Participants, too,
are expected to engage in member checking and presentation of these narrative
products, which involves reviewing and responding to large volumes of
documents. Given the dual burden and the need for more efficient and
participant-friendly approaches to narrative making and representation, we made
a first attempt: (i) a new paradigm is proposed, NAME, as the initial attempt
to push the field of narrative inquiry. Name is able to transfer research
documents into coherent story images, alleviating the cognitive burden of
interpreting extensive text-based materials during member checking for both
researchers and participants. (ii) We develop an actor location and shape
module to facilitate plausible image generation. (iii) We have designed a set
of robust evaluation metrics comprising three key dimensions to objectively
measure the perceptual quality and narrative consistency of generated
characters. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across different data partitioning schemes. Remarkably, while the baseline
relies on the full 100% of the available data, our method requires only 0.96%
yet still reduces the FID score from 195 to 152. Under identical data volumes,
our method delivers substantial improvements: for the 70:30 split, the FID
score decreases from 175 to 152, and for the 95:5 split, it is nearly halved
from 96 to 49. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves a score of 3.62 on the
newly introduced metric, surpassing the baseline score of 2.66.

TL;DR: HERO-VQL是一种新颖的自我中心视觉查询定位方法，通过分层注意力引导和增强一致性训练，有效解决了自我中心视频中物体外观变化和遮挡问题，在VQ2D数据集上显著超越基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自我中心视频中频繁和突然的视角变化导致显著的物体外观变化和部分遮挡，使得现有方法难以实现精确定位。

Method: 提出分层注意力引导（TAG）和自我中心增强一致性训练（EgoACT）。TAG利用类别token进行高层上下文指导和主成分得分图进行细粒度定位。EgoACT通过替换查询对象和重新排序视频帧来增强查询多样性并模拟极端视角变化。

Result: 在VQ2D数据集上的大量实验验证了HERO-VQL能有效处理自我中心挑战，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HERO-VQL受人类认知过程启发，通过分层注意力机制和增强训练策略，成功解决了自我中心视频中的物体定位难题，为视觉查询定位领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the egocentric visual query localization (VQL), where
a model should localize the query object in a long-form egocentric video.
Frequent and abrupt viewpoint changes in egocentric videos cause significant
object appearance variations and partial occlusions, making it difficult for
existing methods to achieve accurate localization. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization
(HERO-VQL), a novel method inspired by human cognitive process in object
recognition. We propose i) Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) and ii) Egocentric
Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT). Top-down Attention Guidance
refines the attention mechanism by leveraging the class token for high-level
context and principal component score maps for fine-grained localization. To
enhance learning in diverse and challenging matching scenarios, EgoAug enhances
query diversity by replacing the query with a randomly selected corresponding
object from groundtruth annotations and simulates extreme viewpoint changes by
reordering video frames. Additionally, CT loss enforces stable object
localization across different augmentation scenarios. Extensive experiments on
VQ2D dataset validate that HERO-VQL effectively handles egocentric challenges,
significantly outperforming baselines.

*Mengxiao Geng,Ran Hong,Bingxuan Li,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双约束扩散模型(DCDM)用于超低剂量PET重建，通过冻结预训练扩散模型权重并注入可训练的双约束控制器，大幅减少可训练参数数量，能够适应不同剂量水平而无需重新训练所有参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量PET重建具有减少患者辐射暴露和缩短检查时间的潜力，但可能导致噪声增加和成像细节减少，降低图像质量。需要一种既能保持图像质量又能灵活适应不同剂量水平的重建方法。

Method: DCDM冻结预训练扩散模型权重，注入可训练的双约束控制器(NTC和ENC)。NTC利用核范数作为矩阵秩最小化近似，将低秩特性集成到Transformer架构中；ENC利用压缩特征表示编码和控制预训练扩散模型。

Result: 在UDPET公共数据集和临床数据集上的实验表明，DCDM在已知剂量减少因子(DRF)上优于最先进方法，并且在未知DRF场景下具有良好的泛化能力，即使在超低剂量水平(如全剂量的1%)也表现出色。

Conclusion: DCDM通过双约束机制有效提升了超低剂量PET重建的性能和灵活性，能够适应不同剂量水平而无需完全重新训练，在临床应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Ultra-low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction holds
significant potential for reducing patient radiation exposure and shortening
examination times. However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced
imaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we
present a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights
of a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint
controller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of
trainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full
fine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining
all model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility.
Specifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer
Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the
pre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an
approximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property
into the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction
from low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in
the latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature
representations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model,
ultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical
reconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the
most suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction.
Experiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset
demonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose
reduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving
valuable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全景视频的宽视场角经常导致不需要的物体出现在视频中，现有方法主要针对普通窄视场视频，无法处理等距柱状投影的畸变问题

Method: DAOVI模型包含两个核心模块：基于测地距离评估时间运动信息的图像空间模块，以及处理几何畸变的深度感知特征传播特征空间模块

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在定量和定性评估上都优于现有方法

Conclusion: DAOVI成功解决了全景视频修复中的几何畸变问题，为全景视频处理提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a
variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their
wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This
problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal
of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency.
Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a
narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular
projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting,
called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI
introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image
space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature
propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the
geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉细粒度动态细节和生成新视角的合理细节方面存在困难，主要源于化身模型表示能力有限和观测数据不足。

Method: 利用Human4DiT视频生成模型生成替代视角的人体运动作为额外监督；通过视频微调注入物理身份确保运动一致性；采用基于块的去噪算法实现高分辨率输出。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法优于当前最先进方法，验证了所提策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过视频生成模型提供的多视角监督信号能够有效丰富细节、减少伪影，提升人体化身重建质量。

Abstract: We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular
videos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained
dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel
viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the
avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges,
we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to
generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional
supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously
unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to
mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to
enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we
inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For
higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm
is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies.

TL;DR: LightVLM是一种无需训练即可加速现有视觉语言模型推理的方法，通过分层令牌合并和KV缓存压缩技术，在保持性能的同时大幅提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型推理过程存在计算效率低、延迟高的问题，特别是在处理长序列时。需要一种无需重新训练就能显著加速推理的方法，以促进实际部署。

Method: 将推理过程分为编码和解码两个阶段：编码阶段使用金字塔令牌合并技术分层减少不同LLM层的令牌数量；解码阶段采用KV缓存压缩技术移除不必要的缓存以提高网络吞吐量。

Result: 仅保留35%图像令牌时性能保持100%，仅保留3%图像令牌时性能保持约98%。网络吞吐量提升2.02倍，预填充时间减少3.65倍，长序列生成时推理时间减少3.21倍。

Conclusion: LightVLM有效解决了VLMs推理效率问题，使大型模型推理速度超过小型模型，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can
be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly
accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the
inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and
propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve
model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce
tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping
a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at
reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache
compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput.
Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance
when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance
when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network
throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes
large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to
infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B),
hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text
sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by
3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Controllable face generation poses critical challenges in generative modeling
due to the intricate balance required between semantic controllability and
photorealism. While existing approaches struggle with disentangling semantic
controls from generation pipelines, we revisit the architectural potential of
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of expert specialization. This
paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a novel framework featuring: (1)
Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space
factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) A mixture of global
and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics
for fine-grained controllability; (3) A dynamic gating network producing
time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial
locations. Face-MoGLE provides a powerful and flexible solution for
high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative
modeling and security applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its
robust zero-shot generalization capability. Project page is available at

Conclusion: SemaMIL成功解决了现有方法在计算病理学中的局限性，在保持可解释性的同时实现了更好的性能和效率。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the leading approach for
extracting discriminative features from whole slide images (WSIs) in
computational pathology. Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches
but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to
model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to
overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling
patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this
work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an
adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in
sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval
State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to
adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four
WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.

*Bo Wu,Zhiqi Ai,Jun Jiang,Congcong Zhu,Shugong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SA-LDL算法，通过阶段自适应方差建模和加权损失函数，有效解决年龄估计中的标签模糊性问题，在MORPH-II和FG-NET数据集上分别达到1.74和2.15的MAE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过标签分布学习建模相邻年龄组的相关性，但忽略了不同年龄阶段存在不同程度的标签模糊性。

Method: 提出阶段自适应标签分布学习算法(SA-LDL)，基于嵌入相似性分析发现标签模糊性呈现明显的阶段模式，采用阶段自适应方差建模和加权损失函数。

Result: 在MORPH-II数据集上MAE为1.74，在FG-NET数据集上MAE为2.15，表现出竞争性性能。

Conclusion: SA-LDL能够有效捕捉标签模糊性的复杂结构化特性，实现更准确和鲁棒的年龄估计。

Abstract: Label ambiguity poses a significant challenge in age estimation tasks. Most
existing methods address this issue by modeling correlations between adjacent
age groups through label distribution learning. However, they often overlook
the varying degrees of ambiguity present across different age stages. In this
paper, we propose a Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL)
algorithm, which leverages the observation -- revealed through our analysis of
embedding similarities between an anchor and all other ages -- that label
ambiguity exhibits clear stage-wise patterns. By jointly employing stage-wise
adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss function, SA-LDL effectively
captures the complex and structured nature of label ambiguity, leading to more
accurate and robust age estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SA-LDL achieves competitive performance, with MAE of 1.74 and 2.15 on the
MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.

*Xiang Chen,Renjiu Hu,Jinwei Zhang,Yuxi Zhang,Xinyao Yue,Min Liu,Yaonan Wang,Hang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR)框架，通过分离特征学习和光流估计，使用3层卷积网络进行特征提取，构建拉普拉斯特征金字塔，在大变形模型下实现渐进式可微变形，在精度-效率和精度-平滑度权衡方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于学习的技术显著提高了可变形图像配准的精度和速度，但仍面临计算复杂度高和处理大变形等挑战。研究卷积神经网络在配准中的作用机制，寻求更好的精度-效率权衡。

Method: 提出EOIR框架：分离特征学习和光流估计，使用3层ConvNet进行特征提取，多组3层光流估计器构建拉普拉斯特征金字塔，在大变形模型下渐进式合成可微变形。

Result: 在5个不同模态和解剖区域的数据集上验证，EOIR实现了优越的精度-效率和精度-平滑度权衡，在保持可比精度的同时提供更好的效率和平滑度。

Conclusion: EOIR框架通过分析ConvNet在配准中的双重作用（线性化局部强度和协调全局对比度变化），设计出高效的配准方法，在多个数据集上证明了其有效性，代码将开源。

Abstract: Learning-based techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and speed
of deformable image registration. However, challenges such as reducing
computational complexity and handling large deformations persist. To address
these challenges, we analyze how convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)
influence registration performance using the Horn-Schunck optical flow
equation. Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe
that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities
and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose
the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a
better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow
estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set
of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid,
progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation
model. Results on five datasets across different modalities and anatomical
regions demonstrate EOIR's effectiveness, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs. With comparable
accuracy, EOIR provides better efficiency and smoothness, and vice versa. The
source code of EOIR will be publicly available on
https://github.com/XiangChen1994/EOIR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为研究大型语言模型的决策能力提供一个简单但具有挑战性的测试环境，通过精确控制跳跃力度的游戏机制来评估多方面的认知能力

Method: 使用Jump-Jump游戏作为测试平台，要求模型根据当前位置和目标平台距离来精确计算跳跃力度，测试空间推理、物理建模和战略规划能力

Result: 该游戏机制能够有效测试LLM在复杂决策任务中的表现，特别是需要精确控制和多认知维度协调的场景

*Zhihong Zhang,Xiaojian Huang,Jin Xu,Zhuodong Luo,Xinzhi Wang,Jiansheng Wei,Xuejin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoRewardBench是首个全面的视频多模态奖励模型评估基准，涵盖感知、知识、推理和安全四个核心维度，包含1,563个高质量标注样本，评估了28个模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频多模态奖励模型评估基准存在样本数量有限、评估维度不全面、模型类型覆盖不足等问题，需要建立一个更全面的评估框架。

Method: 通过AI辅助数据管道构建包含1,563个标注样本的高质量偏好数据集，每个样本包含视频-文本提示、选择响应和拒绝响应的三元组，评估了生成式、判别式和半标量三类共28个模型。

Result: 最佳模型GPT-4o仅达到57.0%的总体准确率，开源最佳模型Qwen2.5-VL-72B仅为53.3%。研究发现：RL训练不一定带来更好的跨模态泛化；除判别式模型外，其他模型都能从推理时缩放中受益；不同模型对视频帧数变化反应不同。

Conclusion: VideoRewardBench为视频领域多模态奖励模型的评估和发展提供了一个具有挑战性和价值的基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性并为未来研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training,
inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing
response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video
domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of
comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types
of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding:
perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data
pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated
samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times
the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a
triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected
response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal
reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and
semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves
only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key
insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily
exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii)
except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model
capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in
input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We
believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for
advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.

*Zhongmiao Qi,Yan Jiang,Bolin Zhang,Lijun Guo,Chong Wang,Qiangbo Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了STVH和M-STVH两种时空视频哈希方法，用于细粒度的群体活动视频检索，能够同时建模个体对象动态和群体交互，在公开数据集上取得优异效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着复杂场景中视频数据的爆炸式增长，快速检索群体活动成为迫切需求。现有方法只能检索整个视频，无法实现活动粒度的检索。

Method: STVH通过统一框架同时建模个体对象动态和群体交互，捕捉群体视觉特征和位置特征的时空演化。M-STVH作为增强版本，通过多焦点表示学习实现分层特征集成，能够同时关注活动语义特征和对象视觉特征。

Result: 在公开数据集上的对比实验表明，STVH和M-STVH都能取得优异的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的STVH和M-STVH方法有效解决了细粒度群体活动视频检索问题，能够适应不同检索需求场景。

Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly
retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks
can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity
granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal
interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified
framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group
interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual
features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval
scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it
may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH
(multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle
this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature
integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model
to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We
conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH
and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.

### [45] [TRUST: Token-dRiven Ultrasound Style Transfer for Cross-Device Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00508)
*Nhat-Tuong Do-Tran,Ngoc-Hoang-Lam Le,Ian Chiu,Po-Tsun Paul Kuo,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRUST是一个针对超声图像的双流框架，通过token驱动机制选择合适的目标风格特征，在保持源内容的同时转换目标域风格，提升下游任务性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同设备采集的超声图像存在风格差异，导致下游任务性能下降。现有UI2I方法未能充分考虑下游任务需求，可能产生与任务需求不匹配的转换结果

Method: 提出token驱动的双流框架：1）数据视角选择合适的目标token；2）模型视角通过行为镜像损失识别最优目标token；3）在源编码器中注入辅助提示以匹配下游行为

Result: 在超声数据集上的实验表明，TRUST在视觉质量和下游任务性能方面均优于现有UI2I方法

Conclusion: TRUST通过显式考虑下游任务需求，有效解决了超声图像风格转换中的内容保持和风格对齐问题，为跨设备超声图像分析提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Ultrasound images acquired from different devices exhibit diverse styles,
resulting in decreased performance of downstream tasks. To mitigate the style
gap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images
from a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target
domain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications.
However, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the
most relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned
with the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a
token-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while
transferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and
style remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we
introduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a
data view--selecting "suitable" target tokens corresponding to each source
token, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal" target tokens for the
downstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject
auxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with
downstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets demonstrate
that TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and
downstream task performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Black-Box Distillation (B2D)设置和ATGC方法，通过注意力引导的动态尺度选择解决黑盒模型蒸馏中的分辨率诅咒问题，仅使用one-hot预测实现有效的本地模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI即服务的兴起使得预训练模型通过API普及，但现有方法无法在无法获取模型权重、训练数据或logits的黑盒约束下有效训练本地模型。

Method: 提出ATGC方法，利用DINOv2注意力图通过熵评分动态选择最优尺度进行黑盒模型推理，识别信息丰富的尺度进行伪标签生成和蒸馏。

Result: 实验表明在多个数据集上，仅使用one-hot API预测就能在黑盒监督下实现显著性能提升。

Conclusion: ATGC方法有效解决了开放词汇模型的分辨率敏感性问题，为黑盒模型蒸馏提供了实用解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) democratizes access
to pre-trained models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but also
raises a fundamental question: how can local models be effectively trained
using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or
logits, a constraint in which current domain adaptation paradigms are
impractical ? To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box
Distillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under
realistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on
large-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot
predictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant
sensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented
optimally at different scales, a limitation termed the "curse of resolution".
Our method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by
leveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for
black-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to
identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective
distillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box
supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API
predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/ATGC.

TL;DR: 提出LBD框架解决CISS中的语义纠缠问题，利用CLIP的语义先验进行特征解耦，在Pascal VOC和ADE20k上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CISS方法存在原型-特征纠缠和背景-增量纠缠问题，视觉特征学习缺乏足够区分线索导致噪声和错误

Method: 使用预训练视觉-语言模型的先验语义指导，通过语言引导原型解耦和流形互背景解耦实现特征自主解耦，结合软提示调优和编码器适配

Result: 在Pascal VOC和ADE20k数据集上实现最先进性能，特别是在多步增量场景中表现优异

Conclusion: LBD框架有效解决了CISS中的语义纠缠问题，证明了语言先验在特征解耦中的重要作用

Abstract: Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) requires continuous learning
of newly introduced classes while retaining knowledge of past classes. By
abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and
prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed
catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature
Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process,
and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing
techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to
distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these
issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework
(LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language
models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features
through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual
Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new
prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates,
while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based
supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating
soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the
capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in
multi-step scenarios.

TL;DR: BrainFM是一个模态无关的多任务视觉基础模型，通过创新的"轻度到重度"生成和"真实-合成"混合训练策略，能够处理多种脑成像任务并适应不同的成像外观差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法在校准医学成像（如CT）中表现优异，但在未校准模态（特别是MRI）中泛化能力差，对MR对比度、分辨率和方向差异敏感，限制了在多样化临床协议中的广泛应用。

Method: 提出"轻度到重度"主体内生成和"真实-合成"混合训练策略，使模型对获取图像的外观（如模态、对比度、变形、分辨率、伪影）具有鲁棒性。

Result: 在11个公共数据集上评估，证明BrainFM在所有任务和输入模态中都具有鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: BrainFM为脑成像提供了一个强大的多任务基础模型，能够直接应用于多种基础脑成像任务，具有广泛的临床适用性。

Abstract: Recent learning-based approaches have made astonishing advances in calibrated
medical imaging like computerized tomography (CT), yet they struggle to
generalize in uncalibrated modalities -- notably magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging, where performance is highly sensitive to the differences in MR
contrast, resolution, and orientation. This prevents broad applicability to
diverse real-world clinical protocols. Here we introduce BrainFM, a
modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging.
With the proposed "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth"
mix-up training strategy, BrainFM is resilient to the appearance of acquired
images (e.g., modality, contrast, deformation, resolution, artifacts), and can
be directly applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image
synthesis for CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical
distance, bias field estimation, and registration. We evaluate the efficacy of
BrainFM on eleven public datasets, and demonstrate its robustness and
effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DiffusionDet方法在上下文依赖场景中受限于局部特征条件，性能有限，需要更好的全局上下文整合

Method: 引入Context-Aware Fusion (CAF)，使用专用编码器生成全局场景上下文，通过交叉注意力机制让每个目标提案都能关注到全面的环境信息

Result: 在CarDD基准测试中超越了最先进模型，为细粒度领域的上下文感知目标检测建立了新的性能基准

Conclusion: CAF框架通过有效整合全局场景上下文，显著提升了生成式检测范式的性能，特别适用于具有挑战性的细粒度视觉领域

Abstract: Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle
damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to
resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through
conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local
feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this
fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which
leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with
local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a
separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental
information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level
understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection
paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive
environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over
state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance
benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型从自然图像领域迁移到遥感分割领域的挑战，包括遥感数据类别多样性有限以及自然图像与遥感图像之间的领域差异。

Method: 1) 全局-局部解耦模块：使用NLP技术将文本分为局部类别名词和全局修饰词，通过无监督掩码提议网络将图像分割为类别无关的掩码提议；2) 局部尺度对齐：通过上下文感知裁剪策略提取图像块，并引入遥感特定知识丰富文本输入；3) 全局尺度对齐：提出跨尺度Grad-CAM模块利用全局修饰词的上下文信息精炼Grad-CAM图，通过掩码选择模块整合像素级激活到掩码级分割输出。

Result: 实现了遥感图像的开集语义分割(OVSS)和参考表达分割(RES)，提供了准确且可解释的全局和局部维度对齐。

Conclusion: DGL-RSIS框架成功解决了视觉语言模型在遥感图像分割中的迁移挑战，通过解耦和对齐策略实现了无需训练的高性能分割。

Abstract: The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and
language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional
visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural
image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the
limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural
and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that
decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at
both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored
strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)
module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global
modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are
partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask
proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local
scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image
patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich
the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual
features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a
Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual
information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module
integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation
output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across
global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change,
making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning
(ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing
downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane
detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as
orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to
enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these
preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We
find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to
those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an
orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter
baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets
comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the
Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at

TL;DR: MV-SSM是一个新颖的多视角状态空间建模框架，通过投影状态空间块和网格令牌引导的双向扫描技术，显著提升了多视角3D人体姿态估计的泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于注意力机制的transformer在多视角3D人体姿态估计中存在两个主要问题：1）难以准确建模关键点的空间排列，特别是在遮挡场景下；2）容易过拟合训练数据中的特定相机配置和视觉场景，导致在新设置下性能大幅下降

Method: 提出MV-SSM框架，在两个层次上显式建模关节空间序列：多视角图像的特征层次和人体关键点层次。引入投影状态空间(PSS)块来学习关节空间排列的泛化表示，并改进Mamba的传统扫描为网格令牌引导的双向扫描(GTBS)

Result: 在多个实验中表现出强大的泛化能力：在CMU Panoptic的三相机设置上AP25提升10.8(+24%)，在变化相机配置上AP25提升7.0(+13%)，在跨数据集评估中Campus A1的PCP提升15.3(+38%)

Conclusion: MV-SSM通过状态空间建模和创新的扫描机制，有效解决了多视角3D人体姿态估计中的泛化问题，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有最先进方法

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose
estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging,
particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing
attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial
arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they
tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training
data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this
study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named
MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the
joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from
multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State
Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial
arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's
traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning
(GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate
that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU
Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP
(+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations. Project Website:

Motivation: 珠宝识别因款式多样而具有挑战性，目前精确描述仅限于行业专家，但翻译和口译人员需要全面了解珠宝信息

Method: 采用三种不同详细程度的描述层次，使用计算机视觉技术和图像字幕架构，特别是编码器-解码器模型，检测珠宝并生成自然语言描述

Result: 构建了全面的珠宝图像数据库，经过评估后最终模型的字幕生成准确率超过90%

Conclusion: 该方法能有效帮助翻译和口译人员快速获取准确的珠宝信息，解决了珠宝识别和描述的难题

Abstract: Identifying jewelry pieces presents a significant challenge due to the wide
range of styles and designs. Currently, precise descriptions are typically
limited to industry experts. However, translators and interpreters often
require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we
introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry
using neural networks. This method enables translators and interpreters to
quickly access accurate information, aiding in resolving queries and gaining
essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels
of description, employing computer vision techniques and image captioning to
emulate expert analysis of accessories. The key innovation involves generating
natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels,
capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning
architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions
with varying levels of detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in recognizing diverse types of jewelry, we assembled a comprehensive database
of accessory images. The evaluation process involved comparing various image
captioning architectures, focusing particularly on the encoder decoder model,
crucial for generating descriptive captions. After thorough evaluation, our
final model achieved a captioning accuracy exceeding 90 per cent.

TL;DR: FtZ框架通过组合语义强大的锚编码器和感知丰富的增强编码器，解决了MLLMs在精细视觉任务中的性能瓶颈，显著提升了多个基准测试的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在复杂语义理解方面表现出色，但在需要精确细节感知的基础视觉任务上存在不足，这主要源于单一视觉编码器的架构限制。

Method: 提出FtZ视觉塔框架，通过轻量级多头交叉注意力机制，将语义强大的锚编码器与感知丰富的增强编码器组合，超越单一编码器设计。

Result: 在TextVQA、POPE、MMMU、MME和MM-Vet等需要精细视觉理解的基准测试中，FtZ模型显著优于仅使用单一编码器或现有特征融合方法的基线模型。

Conclusion: 组合异构专家编码器是克服当前MLLMs视觉感知瓶颈的有效途径，为构建具有更强感知能力的下一代AI系统提供了新的设计范式。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they
face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic
understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require
precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent
architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level
semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture
fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to
Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the
single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor
encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head
Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several
challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as
TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms
baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods.
This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient
and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current
MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems
with stronger perceptual capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出STM策略，通过参数高效微调视觉基础模型，仅使用少量正常天气数据实现恶劣天气下的单目深度估计，在多个真实基准测试中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气条件下的单目深度估计面临缺乏可靠真值和难以从未标注真实数据学习的挑战，现有方法存在域差距或违反光度假设的问题

Method: 提出选择-调优-保持(STM)策略，基于熵秩和稳定秩结构分解预训练权重，自适应选择秩数和任务感知奇异方向进行初始化，并施加主方向正则化

Result: 在四个真实世界基准测试中，STM不仅优于现有PEFT方法和全微调，还超越了使用恶劣合成数据训练的方法，甚至超过深度基础模型

Conclusion: STM策略能够在保持预训练模型泛化能力的同时实现灵活的任务适应，为恶劣天气下的深度估计提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog,
snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable
ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data.
Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which
suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates
photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to
achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient
Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small
amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong
performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored
for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of
balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge.
To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy,
which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds
of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we
adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular
directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned
weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction
regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task
adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the
pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across
diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing
PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with
adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model

*Xiyao Wang,Chunyuan Li,Jianwei Yang,Kai Zhang,Bo Liu,Tianyi Xiong,Furong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究挑战了视觉语言模型中批评模型和策略模型分离的传统，通过将偏好标注的批评数据集重组为可验证的训练信号，直接在基础生成模型上进行强化学习，开发出既能优化偏好判断又保持完整生成能力的统一模型LLaVA-Critic-R1。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言建模中，批评模型仅用于评估输出（分配标量分数或成对偏好），而策略模型负责生成响应，这种分离导致批评模型很少被考虑直接用于策略目的。本研究旨在挑战这一惯例。

Method: 将偏好标注的批评数据集重组为可验证的训练信号，在基础生成模型上直接进行强化学习，训练出多模态批评模型LLaVA-Critic-R1，该模型既能优化偏好判断又保持完整生成能力。

Result: LLaVA-Critic-R1不仅成为顶级批评模型，还作为竞争性策略模型，在26个视觉推理和理解基准测试中匹配或超越使用领域内数据训练的专业推理VLM，平均比基础模型(Qwen-2.5-VL-7B)提升+5.7%。扩展该方法到现有强推理VLM得到LLaVA-Critic-R1+，在7B规模上实现MMMU基准71.9的SoTA性能。测试时应用自我批评可获得平均+13.8%的改进。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在批评数据上进行RL训练可以产生一个在评估和生成方面都表现出色的统一模型，为可扩展、自我改进的多模态系统提供了一条简单路径。

Abstract: In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate
outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to
generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the
responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct
policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to
reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals
and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,
producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference
judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,
LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a
competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs
trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding
benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).
Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields
LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing
critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.
Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying
self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five
representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal
that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both
evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable,
self-improving multimodal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法存在二次计算复杂度问题，难以建模长距离空间-光谱特征依赖关系。Mamba虽能解决计算负担问题，但无法直接进行特征融合。

Method: 设计预处理模块适配Mamba结构，结合CNN提取多层特征；创新设计基于Mamba算子的跨状态模块来充分融合双模态特征；构建结合Mamba和CNN优势的强大骨干网络。

Result: 在MUUFL和Houston2018两个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在降低网络训练负担的前提下，性能优于Transformer方法。

Conclusion: CSFMamba网络成功利用了Mamba的低计算负担优势，探索了多模态特征融合的内部结构潜力，实现了更强的全图像理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has made great progress in the field of remote sensing
image classification due to its ability to exploit the complementary
spatial-spectral information. Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer
have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted
that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result,
modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an
overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating
time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization,
but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of
Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal
structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba
(CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of
remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine
it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module
based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the
two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a
more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and
LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental
results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method
outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of
reducing the network training burden.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition leverages sequences of human joint
coordinates to identify actions performed in videos. Owing to the intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure of skeleton data, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
have been the dominant architecture in this field. However, recent advances in
transformer models and masked pretraining frameworks open new avenues for
representation learning. In this work, we propose CascadeFormer, a family of
two-stage cascading transformers for skeleton-based human action recognition.
Our framework consists of a masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable
skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage tailored
for discriminative action classification. We evaluate CascadeFormer across
three benchmark datasets (Penn Action N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60), achieving
competitive performance on all tasks. To promote reproducibility, we release
our code and model checkpoints.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型中的投影层虽然重要，但其对未见视觉概念的泛化能力尚未得到系统评估，需要建立专门的评测框架。

Method: 将目标检测数据集转换为提示格式，设计标签集不相交的训练/测试分割，通过机制解释方法分析投影层的工作机制。

Result: 投影层在未见类别上保持了79-88%的相对性能，表现出非平凡的泛化能力，其前馈网络类似键值记忆机制处理新旧概念。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了新的对齐泛化评估框架，表明在有限对齐数据下进行高效VLM训练的潜力，投影层具有较好的概念泛化特性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language
model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on
multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection
layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its
importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been
systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for
evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets
(rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design
train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen
and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection
layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes
compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level
of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those
concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in
the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and
unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework
for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM
training with limited aligned data.

Conclusion: 提出的公平性算法为皮肤病变分类提供了一种实用的解决方案，能够在现实应用中更好地确保诊断公平性

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of
skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting
equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related
to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is
challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational
demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these
challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that
overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across
varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the
convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches
and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary
channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This
approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on
conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while
maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

*Sangyu Han,Yearim Kim,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaFE方法通过有效感受野和输入归因技术，揭示视觉SAE特征的真实因果驱动因素，而非仅依赖激活位置，避免了传统激活图可能导致的误解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过检查特征激活最高的图像块来理解稀疏自编码器特征，但由于自注意力机制在整个图像中混合信息，激活的块往往只是与特征激活共现而非因果驱动，这可能导致对特征含义的误解。

Method: 提出因果特征解释(CaFE)方法，利用有效感受野(ERF)概念，将每个SAE特征激活视为目标，应用输入归因方法来识别因果驱动该激活的图像块。

Result: 在CLIP-ViT特征上，ERF映射经常与朴素激活图不同，揭示了隐藏的上下文依赖关系（如"咆哮面孔"特征需要眼睛和鼻子的共现，而不仅仅是张开的嘴）。块插入测试证实CaFE比激活排序的块更有效地恢复或抑制特征激活。

Conclusion: CaFE提供了对视觉SAE特征更忠实和语义精确的解释，强调了仅依赖激活位置可能导致误解的风险，为理解视觉Transformer中的特征表示提供了更可靠的因果分析方法。

Abstract: Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers
truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's
activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the
entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the
feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages
Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature
to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image
patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps
frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context
dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of
eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm
that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than
activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and
semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk
of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的视觉-语言检索方法在处理描述抽象事件、隐式因果关系、时间上下文或长复杂叙事的文本时表现不佳，需要更好地理解视觉特征和潜在事件语义。

Method: 采用多阶段检索框架：密集文章检索、事件识别语言模型重排、高效图片收集，继而进行描述引导的语义匹配和排名感知选择。利用Qwen3进行文章搜索，Qwen3-Reranker进行上下文对齐，Qwen2-VL进行精确图片评分。通过反向排名融合(RRF)融合多种配置的输出。

Result: 在EVENTA 2025挑战赛Track 2的私有测试集上获得了第一名的成绩，证明了该方法在处理复杂实际图片理解任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合基于语言的推理和多模态检索的方法能够有效解决复杂的实际图片理解问题，为事件基于图片检索领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Event-based image retrieval from free-form captions presents a significant
challenge: models must understand not only visual features but also latent
event semantics, context, and real-world knowledge. Conventional
vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe
abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex
narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval
framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model
reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic
matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search,
Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image
scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from
multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves
the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand
Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based
reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

Abstract: We present a unified vision-language framework tailored for ENT endoscopy
image analysis that simultaneously tackles three clinically-relevant tasks:
image classification, image-to-image retrieval, and text-to-image retrieval.
Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal
semantics, our approach leverages the CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone and enhances it
through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical
feature interpolation. These components collectively enable efficient
fine-tuning on limited medical data while improving representation diversity
and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual
inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural
language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training
objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We
validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand
Challenge, achieving 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of
0.93 and 0.92 for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval respectively, and
MRR scores of 0.97 and 0.96. Ablation studies demonstrated the incremental
benefits of each architectural component, validating the effectiveness of our
design for robust multimodal medical understanding in low-resource clinical
settings.

Gaussians into Splatter Image format, enabling direct neural processing for
arbitrary message embedding. To ensure imperceptibility, we design a

visual quality. For robust message recovery, we develop a dense

Conclusion: 成功解决了HOI检测中的"毒兄弟"偏差问题，提出的去偏学习方法有效提升了检测精度和性能

Abstract: Detection transformers have been applied to human-object interaction (HOI)
detection, enhancing the localization and recognition of human-action-object
triplets in images. Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a
critical issue-"Toxic Siblings" bias-which hinders the interaction decoder's
learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even
compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction
decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling
triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces
precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline.
To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning
objectives-"contrastive-then-calibration" and "merge-then-split"-targeting the
input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like
incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by
strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling

Abstract: Human motion generation has shown great advances thanks to the recent
diffusion models trained on large-scale motion capture data. Most of existing
works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes.
Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D
scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One
obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions
is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed,
existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and
manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an
automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich
human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human
motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K
videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and
demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art
methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an
LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse
objects and scenes.

Motivation: 现代面部检索系统多外包给第三方，存在用户照片隐私风险。同态加密虽提供强安全保障，但计算效率低，不适合实时应用

Method: 分为两阶段框架：(1)高速通量可变清单PQ索引模块进行候选筛选，(2)精细化加密空间检索模块进行最终排名。设计了专门的保护机制确保索引模块的安全性和效率

Result: 在标准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在效果、效率和安全性之间取得了良好的平衡

Conclusion: 提出的Cancelable Product Quantization框架为安全面部表征检索提供了高效的解决方案，有效解决了同态加密在实际应用中的性能瓶颈

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage
is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user
portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security
guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high
computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world
applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product
Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation
retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a
high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and
(ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face
ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing
module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an
decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel line segment detector, the Aligned Anchor
Groups guided Line Segment Detector (AAGLSD), designed to detect line segments
from images with high precision and completeness. The algorithm employs a
hierarchical approach to extract candidate pixels with different saliency
levels, including regular anchors and aligned anchor groups. AAGLSD initiates
from these aligned anchor groups, sequentially linking anchors and updating the
currently predicted line segment simultaneously. The final predictions are
derived through straightforward validation and merging of adjacent line
segments, avoiding complex refinement strategies. AAGLSD is evaluated on
various datasets and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method can effectively extract complete line segments from input images
compared to other advanced line segment detectors. The implementation is

Motivation: 现有视觉假体的脑编码阶段缺乏真实脑响应的监督信号，难以生成具有足够生物相似性的脑信号，预测刺激质量是关键问题

Method: 使用预训练CLIP视觉编码器提取图像语义表示，结合交叉注意力增强的U-Net扩散模型通过迭代去噪重建生物合理的脑信号

Result: 在THINGS-EEG2和THINGS-MEG多模态数据集上验证了框架有效性，可视化展示了被试内和被试间的M/EEG信号变异

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成生物学合理的脑信号，交叉注意力机制实现了视觉特征与脑信号表示的细粒度对齐，为视觉假体提供了改进方案

Abstract: Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind
individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the
brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image
generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain
encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with
sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this
problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as
existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses
to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this
issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our
framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP
visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,
and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct
biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike
conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for
conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between
visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained
alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two
multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its
effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we
visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both
datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and
inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型主要关注静态场景理解，忽视了真实驾驶场景中至关重要的时间维度，限制了自动驾驶系统在动态环境中的表现。

Method: 开发了OmniReason-Data数据集（具有密集时空标注和自然语言解释）和OmniReason-Agent架构（包含稀疏时间记忆模块和解释生成器），采用幻觉缓解的自动标注流程和时空知识蒸馏方法。

Result: 在开环规划任务和视觉问答基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了时空推理能力，并为复杂动态环境中的可解释自动驾驶建立了新能力。

Conclusion: OmniReason框架成功解决了自动驾驶中时空推理的关键限制，通过联合建模动态环境和决策过程，为可解释、时间感知的自动驾驶系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
spatial reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving, yet existing methods
predominantly focus on static scene understanding while neglecting the
essential temporal dimension of real-world driving scenarios. To address this
critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes
robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and
their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental
advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale
vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and
natural language explanations, generated through a novel
hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical
plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent
architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent
scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces
human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal
knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal
reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both
open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while
establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous
vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.

TL;DR: MI-RAG是一个多模态迭代检索增强生成框架，通过迭代推理增强检索能力，在知识密集型视觉问答任务中显著提升检索召回率和答案准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在需要外部知识的视觉问答任务中表现有限，传统的单次检索框架往往无法获取足够的知识

Method: 提出多模态迭代RAG框架，利用累积的推理记录动态生成多查询，在异构知识库中进行联合搜索，并将新知识整合到推理记录中逐步优化理解

Result: 在Encyclopedic VQA、InfoSeek和OK-VQA等挑战性基准测试中，MI-RAG显著提高了检索召回率和答案准确率

Conclusion: MI-RAG为知识密集型视觉问答中的组合推理提供了一个可扩展的方法，通过迭代推理和检索的协同作用有效提升了多模态理解能力

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on
knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the
image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for
providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass
framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that
leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly
retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an
accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These
queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases
containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired
knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining
understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks,
including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG
significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing
a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

Conclusion: 该方法为水下探索和海洋感知应用提供了强有力的候选方案，通过语义引导显著提升了水下3D重建性能

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex
challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited
visibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues,
however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI,
particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge
to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity
deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each
Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our
method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The
dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene
understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy,
combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to
further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results
show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement
of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for
applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎儿超声标准平面分类面临组织对比度低、边界模糊和操作者依赖的图像质量变化等挑战，需要一种能够适应真实世界图像质量变化的方法。

Method: 使用浅层纹理敏感网络预测临床合理的对比度参数，通过可微分映射将输入图像转换为多个对比度增强视图，并在下游分类器中融合这些视图。

Conclusion: 该方法通过内容感知的自适应能力，用物理信息转换替代随机预处理，有效桥接低层图像特征与高层语义，为医学图像分析在真实图像质量变化下建立了新范式。

Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable
prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue
contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast
adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical
practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more
discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow
texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters,
transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through
differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated
on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories,
the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with
accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of
traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art
models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its
content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with
physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while
improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This
approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level
semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under
real-world image quality variations.

Result: 相比现有SOTA方法，SDM展现出更强的攻击性能和更高的攻击成本效益，并能与对抗训练方法结合提升防御效果

Conclusion: SDM是一种高效的梯度基攻击方法，通过创新的优化框架设计在对抗攻击领域取得了显著改进

Abstract: Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the
robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the
optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the
difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true
label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed
Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer
optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and
between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages
differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative
probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the
solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability
Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true
labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels'
probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA
methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves
higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with
adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is
available at https://github.com/X-L-Liu/SDM.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多技术融合有效提升了纹理表面缺陷检测性能，在噪声环境下表现出鲁棒性，为工业质检提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability
of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring
U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the
global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects
defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes
background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP)
masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring
robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in
post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics.
Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and
orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack
Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under
the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter
size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的动态3D场景重建方法通常采用两步流程，先估计相机位姿再优化3D高斯，但运动模糊会破坏位姿估计，导致误差累积和重建质量下降。

Method: 将相机和物体运动重新表述为每个基元的SE(3)仿射变换，提出统一优化目标。采用三阶段训练策略：先固定位姿训练3D高斯，再固定高斯优化位姿，最后联合优化所有参数。

Result: 在Stereo Blur数据集和真实世界序列上的实验表明，该方法在重建质量和位姿估计精度方面显著优于现有的动态去模糊方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的统一优化框架通过端到端联合优化相机位姿和3D高斯属性，有效解决了运动模糊带来的挑战，实现了更好的动态场景重建效果。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications
in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe
motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly
follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D
Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose
estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction
results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework
by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS
attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and
object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and
formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we
introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and
Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with
poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being
untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive
experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences
demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction
quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.

Abstract: The DINO family of self-supervised vision models has shown remarkable
transferability, yet effectively adapting their representations for
segmentation remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on heavy
decoders with multi-scale fusion or complex upsampling, which introduce
substantial parameter overhead and computational cost. In this work, we propose
SegDINO, an efficient segmentation framework that couples a frozen DINOv3
backbone with a lightweight decoder. SegDINO extracts multi-level features from
the pretrained encoder, aligns them to a common resolution and channel width,
and utilizes a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks.
This design minimizes trainable parameters while preserving the
representational power of foundation features. Extensive experiments across six
benchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three
natural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha), demonstrate that SegDINO
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/script-Yang/SegDINO.

Abstract: Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in various fields; however,
atmospheric interference and haze significantly degrade image clarity and
reduce the accuracy of information extraction. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin
Transformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail
restoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin
Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and
decoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning
of global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial
for structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a
composite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel
watershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures
pixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse
atmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored
images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models on both the RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. Specifically,
on the RICE dataset, the proposed approach achieved a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an
SSIM of 0.967, which is a significant improvement over existing method. This
study provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in
satellite imagery and highlights its potential applicability across diverse
remote sensing applications.

Conclusion: 该方法通过分解策略和关键帧条件化，实现了更好的长程视角一致性和灵活的相机控制，为单视图新视角合成提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to
large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from
the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and
generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view
alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that
addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene
extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures
long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and
warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a
panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective
image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and
used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates
novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to
prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop
closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on
diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.

TL;DR: 本文提出FQAT方法，通过层冻结机制和梯度无序度指标来解决量化感知训练中的OOD泛化性能下降问题，在I.D和OOD图像分类任务上均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QAT方法主要关注量化模型在分布内数据的性能提升，但忽略了在分布外数据上的性能退化问题。实验证实QAT会导致显著的OOD泛化性能下降。

Method: 提出FQAT方法：1）引入层冻结机制缓解双优化目标间的梯度冲突；2）提出无序引导的自适应冻结算法动态确定冻结层；3）设计梯度无序度指标识别训练中的不稳定层。

Result: 在权威OOD基准测试上的大量实验表明，该方法在I.D和OOD图像分类任务上都优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: FQAT通过面向平坦性的量化感知训练方法，有效解决了QAT导致的OOD泛化性能下降问题，实现了可泛化的量化训练。

Abstract: Current quantization-aware training (QAT) methods primarily focus on
enhancing the performance of quantized models on in-distribution (I.D) data,
while overlooking the potential performance degradation on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data. In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous
experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization
performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the
perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD
generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can
cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method,
FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a
layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between
dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT
proposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically
determines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing
the challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder
metric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during
training. Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmark demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under both I.D and
OOD image classification tasks.

*Zirui Zhou,Zizhao Peng,Dongyang Jin,Chao Fan,Fengwei An,Shiqi Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于姿态的特发性筛查方法，通过创建大规模姿态数据集和双重表征框架解决了传统姿态数据的稀缺和噪声敏感问题，实现了独特的临床不对称性检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI特发性筛查方法主要依赖大规模边缘数据集，忽视了临床上重要的姿态不对称性指标。而姿态数据虽然更有临床解释性，但因为大规模注释数据缺乏和原始坐标的离散性、噪声敏感性而受限。

Method: 提出Scoliosis1K-Pose数据集（447,900帧姿态关键点）和双重表征框架（DRF）。DRF整合连续骨架图保持空间结构，以及编码临床不对称性描述的离散姿态不对称向量（PAV）。还包含一个新题的PAV导向注意力模块（PGA），利用PAV作为临床先验知识来指导特征提取。

Result: 广泛实验证明DRF达到了最先进的性能。可视化结果进一步确认模型利用临床不对称性线索来指导特征提取，促进双重表征之间的协同效应。

Conclusion: 该研究成功解决了姿态基特发性筛查的两大挑战，通过创建大规模注释数据集和创新的双重表征框架，实现了更具临床解释性的高性能特发性检测。

Abstract: Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale
silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural
asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data
provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical
interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based
scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the
scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and
noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of
subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce
Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original
Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050
adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation
Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial
structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes
clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA)
module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from
the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues
to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual
representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at

TL;DR: Spotlighter是一个轻量级的token选择框架，通过评估视觉token的激活值并保留得分最高的token，同时使用语义记忆库和两级排序机制来提升prompt tuning的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP的成功表明prompt tuning可以实现跨模态语义对齐，但冗余或弱相关的特征组件会引入噪声并增加不必要的计算成本。

Method: Spotlighter从样本级和语义级两个角度评估每个视觉token的激活值，只保留得分最高的token用于下游预测。使用类别特定的语义记忆库来精化选择，并引入两级排序机制动态加权token-原型交互。

Result: 在11个few-shot基准测试中，Spotlighter比CLIP在调和平均准确率上提升高达11.19%，额外获得0.8K FPS，仅增加21个参数。

Conclusion: Spotlighter被证明是prompt tuning中一个有效且可扩展的基线方法。

Abstract: CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust
cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition
to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature
components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this
work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that
simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter
evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and
semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for
downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned
prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and
compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals,
we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights
token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter
outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to
0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish
Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for
our method will be available at

TL;DR: 本文提出增量补丁生成(IPG)方法，相比现有方法效率提升11.1倍，同时保持相当的对抗攻击性能，能生成泛化性强的对抗补丁覆盖更广泛的模型漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗补丁对AI模型鲁棒性构成重大挑战，特别是在目标检测等计算机视觉任务中，这些补丁针对图像的特定区域导致模型故障。

Method: 采用增量补丁生成(IPG)方法，通过实验和消融研究验证其有效性，包括YOLO特征分布可视化和对抗训练结果。

Result: IPG方法生成效率比现有方法高11.1倍，攻击性能相当，能产生泛化性强的补丁，有效覆盖更广泛的模型漏洞。IPG生成的数据集可作为构建鲁棒模型的知识基础。

Conclusion: IPG在对抗补丁防御和现实应用（如自动驾驶、安全系统、医疗成像）中具有巨大潜力，能使AI模型在动态高风险环境中保持对对抗攻击的韧性。

Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the
robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks
such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial
examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the
malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation
(IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more
efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack
performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation
studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial
training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that
effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for
constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced
reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of
this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization
not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such
as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models
must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes
environments.

TL;DR: DarkVRAI是一个低光RAW视频去噪框架，通过条件化方案利用拍摄元数据指导对齐和去噪过程，并结合Burst-Order Selective Scan机制建模长程时间依赖关系，在AIM 2025挑战赛中取得第一名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光RAW视频由于高传感器增益和短曝光时间导致的严重信号退化问题，这些限制是由视频帧率要求所固有的。

Method: 提出两个主要贡献：1) 将图像去噪的条件化方案成功应用于视频去噪，显式利用拍摄元数据指导对齐和去噪过程；2) Burst-Order Selective Scan (BOSS)机制有效建模噪声视频序列中的长程时间依赖关系。

Result: 在严格且真实的基准数据集上展示了最先进的性能，为低光视频去噪设立了新标准。

Conclusion: 通过协同结合条件化方案和BOSS机制，DarkVRAI框架在低光RAW视频去噪方面取得了突破性进展，赢得了AIM 2025挑战赛第一名。

Abstract: Low-light RAW video denoising is a fundamentally challenging task due to
severe signal degradation caused by high sensor gain and short exposure times,
which are inherently limited by video frame rate requirements. To address this,
we propose DarkVRAI, a novel framework that achieved first place in the AIM
2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge. Our method introduces two primary
contributions: (1) a successful application of a conditioning scheme for image
denoising, which explicitly leverages capture metadata, to video denoising to
guide the alignment and denoising processes, and (2) a Burst-Order Selective
Scan (BOSS) mechanism that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies
within the noisy video sequence. By synergistically combining these components,
DarkVRAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous and realistic
benchmark dataset, setting a new standard for low-light video denoising.

TL;DR: LangDC是一种语言感知的动态token压缩器，通过轻量级语言模型生成视频片段的软描述token作为视觉表示，根据场景丰富度动态调整压缩比例，在减少49%计算量的同时保持竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频token压缩策略使用固定压缩比例，忽略了不同视频片段语义密度的差异性，导致信息丰富片段表示不足而静态片段计算浪费。

Method: 利用轻量级语言模型描述视频片段生成软描述token，通过语义密度感知监督训练，动态调整压缩比例（描述长度反映场景丰富度）。

Result: 相比VideoGPT+减少49%的FLOPs计算量，同时保持竞争性性能表现，并能根据视频片段丰富度自适应调整token压缩比例。

Conclusion: LangDC通过语言感知的动态token压缩机制，有效解决了固定压缩比例的问题，实现了计算效率与性能的良好平衡，模拟了人类动态描述视觉场景的方式。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video-language models have revolutionized video
understanding tasks. However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by
processing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies
apply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density
among different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate
representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and
unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we
propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a
lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft
caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic
density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary
for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios
based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics
how humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more)
elicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler
scenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our
method reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive
performance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach
adaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在RGB数据上表现优异，但对多光谱数据的简单逐波段优化会导致几何重建不一致，尽管实际几何结构在不同光谱模态下是相同的。

Method: 评估了三种策略：1）无共享结构的逐波段重建；2）分割优化（先优化RGB几何，然后复制并拟合新波段）；3）联合优化（可选的RGB初始阶段）。建议将多光谱数据直接集成到球谐颜色分量中。

Result: 专用优化的联合策略通过定量指标和定性新视角渲染展示出有效性，提高了整体光谱重建质量，并通过光谱串扰增强了RGB结果。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了在优化过程中何时以及如何引入光谱波段的关键权衡，为稳健的多模态3DGS重建提供了实用见解。

Abstract: We present a study of how to integrate color (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery
(red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared) into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework, a state-of-the-art explicit radiance-field-based method for fast and
high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. While 3DGS excels on
RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor
reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral
domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same,
regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three
strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2)
Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and
then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band
representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized,
optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative
metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the
effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall
spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral
cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into
the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's
multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key
trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization,
offering practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雨天天气显著增加交通事故风险，了解有经验驾驶员在恶劣天气下的视觉感知适应行为，对于设计鲁棒的驾驶员监控系统(DMS)和高级驾驶辅助系统(ADAS)至关重要。

Method: 采用两步聚类方法：首先在10秒间隔内对注视点进行聚类，然后将聚类中心聚合成元聚类。结合马尔可夫转移矩阵、注视持续时间、视线高度和方位分布等指标进行分析。

Result: 雨天条件下驾驶员更频繁查看仪表盘、注视持续时间更长、视线高度更高，表明认知专注度增加，但整体注视行为（关注道路并偶尔检查后视镜）保持一致。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了恶劣天气条件下的视觉注意力模式，强调了利用注视建模辅助设计更鲁棒的ADAS和DMS的潜力。

Abstract: Rainy weather significantly increases the risk of road accidents due to
reduced visibility and vehicle traction. Understanding how experienced drivers
adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is
critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye
gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and
rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step
clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals,
and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with
Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze
elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts.
While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror
checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard
glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating
increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual
attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of
leveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS.

Conclusion: CompSlider能够在潜在空间中操作，减少训练和推理的计算负担，实现更可靠和独立的属性操控。

Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over
attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed
text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of
image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for
each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple
attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes,
preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this
challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation
to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach,
CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to
control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel
disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes
while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider
operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require
retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both
training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image
attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理现实世界中玻璃表面的多种污染物，通过测试时自适应机制实现了对未知污染类型的良好泛化能力

Abstract: Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered
to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the
incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing
deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses
relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean
image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of
rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task
of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a
wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign
particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a
great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants.
More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of
different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It
involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model
for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images,
especially the unseen ones.

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced
catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data
through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a
segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray
images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the
image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based
encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two
viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation
of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem
from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer
model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given
sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures
long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive
field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and
decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head
employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The
proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously
segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces
at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic
X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against
state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force
estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation
approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in
both catheter segmentation and force estimation.

Conclusion: LPFM为病理学低级别图像增强提供了首个统一解决方案，显著提升图像质量并降低对物理染色的依赖。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving
remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge
of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world
pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and
low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and
imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces
significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target
individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific
designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges
encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified
Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality
in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as
well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and
special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach
introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable,
stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology
images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified
conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual
prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated
dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5
staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements
(p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual
staining.

Abstract: Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras provide a high dynamic range
and low latency, offering greater robustness to rapid motion and challenging
lighting conditions. Although the potential of event cameras for visual place
recognition (VPR) has been established, developing robust VPR frameworks under
severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we
introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that
combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions,
VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based
ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion
strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting
conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative
improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach
on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric
subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration
that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key
design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction
methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for
robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard
sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence
lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and
benchmarking framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像异常检测需要高效准确的模型，但CNN感受野有限，Transformer计算成本过高。Mamba在NLP中处理长序列的线性复杂度优势为医学图像检测提供了新思路。

Method: 提出SpectMamba架构，包含混合空间-频率注意力块（HSFA）分别学习高低频特征，视觉状态空间模块（VSSM）和Hilbert曲线扫描技术增强空间相关性和局部依赖。

Result: 在多种医学图像检测任务中实现了最先进的性能，同时保持了高效性。

Conclusion: SpectMamba成功将Mamba架构应用于医学图像检测，通过频率-空间特征融合和优化扫描策略，在效率和准确性方面都表现出色，为医学图像分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Abnormality detection in medical imaging is a critical task requiring both
high efficiency and accuracy to support effective diagnosis. While
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models are widely
used, both face intrinsic challenges: CNNs have limited receptive fields,
restricting their ability to capture broad contextual information, and
Transformers encounter prohibitive computational costs when processing
high-resolution medical images. Mamba, a recent innovation in natural language
processing, has gained attention for its ability to process long sequences with
linear complexity, offering a promising alternative. Building on this
foundation, we present SpectMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture designed
for medical image detection. A key component of SpectMamba is the Hybrid
Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, which separately learns high- and
low-frequency features. This approach effectively mitigates the loss of
high-frequency information caused by frequency bias and correlates
frequency-domain features with spatial features, thereby enhancing the model's
ability to capture global context. To further improve long-range dependencies,
we propose the Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) and introduce a novel Hilbert
Curve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local
dependencies, further optimizing the Mamba framework. Comprehensive experiments
show that SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while being both
effective and efficient across various medical image detection tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了双向稀疏注意力（BSA）框架来解决视频DiT模型中的计算瓶颈问题，通过动态稀疏化查询和键值对来显著提升训练和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散Transformer模型在生成高质量视频时面临二次复杂度的计算瓶颈，全注意力机制导致训练和推理成本过高，需要解决查询和键值对的稀疏性问题。

Method: BSA框架包含两个关键组件：通过语义相似性和动态时空训练策略优化查询稀疏性，以及通过统计动态阈值实现KV稀疏性来保留最重要的计算块。

Result: BSA在长序列训练中显著加速DiT，FLOPs减少高达20倍，注意力训练速度提升17.79倍，同时保持甚至超越了全注意力的生成质量。

Conclusion: BSA框架有效解决了视频DiT模型的计算效率问题，为高分辨率长视频生成提供了可行的解决方案，在保持生成质量的同时大幅提升了训练和推理效率。

Abstract: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit
major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration
videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high
training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key
challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and
Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to
leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training,
the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D
full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference
efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query
sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via
semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV
sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain
only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long
sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention
training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full
attention.

TL;DR: VEPE是一个端到端的视频姿态估计框架，通过时空Transformer组件和实例一致性机制，解决了传统两阶段方法效率低和时空上下文分离的问题，在Posetrack数据集上表现优异且推理效率提升300%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频姿态估计方法采用两阶段流程（检测+时序建模），存在时空维度分离、无法端到端优化、依赖复杂后处理导致推理效率低等问题。

Method: 提出VEPE框架，包含三个核心时空Transformer组件：STPE（时空姿态编码器）、STDME（时空可变形记忆编码器）、STPD（时空姿态解码器），并引入实例一致性机制来增强跨帧实例查询的一致性和差异性。

Result: 在Posetrack数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法优于大多数两阶段模型，推理效率提升了300%。

Conclusion: VEPE提供了一个简单灵活的端到端视频姿态估计解决方案，有效利用了时序上下文信息，显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot
be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus
and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human
instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person
pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions
and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances
for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and
complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the
inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we
propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible
framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three
crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose
Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the
Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to
effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation.
Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query
matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to
enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and
realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the
pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the
Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and
improves inference efficiency by 300%.

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，PVINet相比最先进方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: PVINet通过并行处理和特征交互机制有效提升了点云压缩的重建质量。

Abstract: In point cloud compression, the quality of a reconstructed point cloud relies
on both the global structure and the local context, with existing methods
usually processing global and local information sequentially and lacking
communication between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose
a point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet), which captures global structural
features and local contextual features in parallel and performs interactions at
each scale to enhance feature perception efficiency. Specifically, PVINet
contains a voxel-based encoder (Ev) for extracting global structural features
and a point-based encoder (Ep) that models local contexts centered at each
voxel. Particularly, a novel conditional sparse convolution is introduced,
which applies point embeddings to dynamically customize kernels for voxel
feature extraction, facilitating feature interactions from Ep to Ev. During
decoding, a voxel-based decoder employs conditional sparse convolutions to
incorporate point embeddings as guidance to reconstruct the point cloud.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PVINet delivers competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FICGen方法，通过频率启发的上下文解耦生成范式，解决退化场景下布局到图像生成中的上下文幻觉困境，显著提升了生成质量和布局对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在退化场景（如低光照、水下）中，现有的布局到图像生成方法存在生成保真度有限和与用户提供布局对齐弱的问题，主要原因是前景实例被上下文主导的频率分布所淹没的"上下文幻觉困境"。

Method: 提出频率启发的上下文解耦生成范式(FICGen)：1) 使用可学习的双查询机制和频率重采样器从训练集中提取上下文频率原型；2) 采用视觉频率增强注意力将频率原型注入退化生成过程；3) 开发实例一致性图谱来调节实例与周围环境的潜在空间解耦；4) 使用自适应空间频率聚合模块重建空间频率混合的退化表示。

Result: 在5个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，FICGen在各种退化场景（从严重低光照到轻度模糊）中，在生成保真度、对齐性和下游辅助可训练性方面 consistently 超越现有L2I方法。

Conclusion: FICGen通过将退化图像的频率知识转移到潜在扩散空间，有效解决了退化场景下的上下文幻觉问题，为布局到图像生成在挑战性环境中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural
domains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with
user-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light,
underwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the "contextual
illusion dilemma" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are
overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our
paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative
(FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded
images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of
degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware
guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we
introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated
frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from
pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a
visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes
into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and
attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate
latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their
surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to
reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive
experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from
severe low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses
existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream
auxiliary trainability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPSToken是一种基于高斯参数化的空间自适应图像标记化框架，使用2D高斯分布动态建模不同图像区域的形状、位置和纹理特征，实现了非均匀的图像表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法受限于均匀的2D/1D网格标记化，无法灵活表示不同形状、纹理和位置的图像区域，限制了特征表示的有效性。

Method: 使用熵驱动算法将图像分割为纹理均匀的区域，每个区域用2D高斯分布（均值表示位置，协方差表示形状）和纹理特征进行参数化，通过专门设计的transformer优化高斯参数，并通过可微分的splatting渲染器重建特征图。

Result: 在图像重建和生成任务上，使用128个token分别达到了0.65的rFID和1.50的FID分数，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GPSToken通过解耦空间布局和纹理特征，实现了高效的两阶段生成，为图像表示和生成提供了灵活且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image
representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform
2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying
shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of
feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel
$\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive
$\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by
leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position,
and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven
algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable
sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position,
covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer
is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation
of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding,
Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a
differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization
with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial
layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient
two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks,
followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID
scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128
tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at

Motivation: 现有半监督学习方法主要关注生成参考预测的策略，但忽视了标注数据中的潜在噪声以及不同未标注像素的异质性价值，需要更有效地挖掘预测中的丰富信息

Method: 基于空间异质性损失，将未标注数据的预测分为四个区域（UC、US、DC、DS），根据置信度和一致性分配递减权重，并采用自适应阈值区分置信预测和可疑预测

Result: 实验结果表明，MetaSSL与现有SSL框架集成后，在不同数据集上显著提升了分割性能

Conclusion: MetaSSL是一个即插即用的通用框架，通过有效利用预测中的不确定性和一致性信息，能够显著提升半监督医学图像分割的效果

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is important for reducing the annotation cost
for medical image segmentation models. State-of-the-art SSL methods such as
Mean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on
consistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference
prediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have
overlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on
strategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the
heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively
mining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss
function, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is
more essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a
spatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by
simultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between
the reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the
predictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the
loss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant
and Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive
threshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious
ones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust
learning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is
plug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods. The experimental
results showed that it improved the segmentation performance significantly when
integrated with existing SSL frameworks on different datasets. Code is
available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/MetaSSL.

Result: 大量实验证明各组件有效性，性能超越之前最先进方法

Conclusion: MVTrajecter通过利用多时间戳轨迹信息，显著提升了多视角行人跟踪的关联鲁棒性和准确性

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods
that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great
progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is
important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only
on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past
trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method
called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information
from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association.
MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to
effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These
costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are
likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a
current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past
timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian
with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition,
MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps
leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理视频时依赖视觉-语言编码器进行关键帧采样，但这些编码器是否能真正识别最具信息量的帧尚不清楚，需要实证研究其能力局限。

Method: 通过实证研究分析流行视觉编码器在识别视频关键帧方面的表现，检验其能否为给定的文本查询选择最合适的视频帧。

Result: 研究发现当前流行的视觉编码器在识别MLLM应该关注的关键帧方面存在严重局限，无法有效识别处理特定文本查询所需的最具信息量的视频帧。

Conclusion: 为了构建高效的多模态视频大语言模型，需要开发更好的关键帧识别技术来替代当前依赖的视觉编码器方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much
progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of
processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods
guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains
unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames.
In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that
popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to
identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given
textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of
better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video
MLLMs.

Motivation: 解决EEG信号低空间分辨率、神经记录与视频动态时间不匹配、以及脑活动中语义信息利用不足等问题，现有方法难以同时处理动态连贯性和复杂语义上下文

Method: 采用三个核心模块：区域感知语义映射器(RSM)提取多模态语义特征，时间感知动态对齐器(TDA)生成动态潜在序列确保时间一致性，双引导视频重建器(DGVR)将时序蓝图转换为高保真视频

Result: 在SEED-DV数据集上达到新的SOTA，视频和帧级准确率分别提升12.5和10.3个百分点，SSIM提升9.4%，FVMD降低19.7%，展现出卓越的视觉保真度和时间连贯性

Conclusion: DynaMind在神经动力学和高保真视觉语义之间架起了关键桥梁，标志着该领域的重大进展

Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low
spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and
video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain
activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the
dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual
stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel
framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and
semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper
(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video
Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to
extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain
regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the
TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal
consistency between the feature representations and the original neural
recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR
translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video
reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by
12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in
pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence
with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical
advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual
semantics.

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized
images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time
optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple
subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity
and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a
framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic
correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method
progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a
weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing
regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus
allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of
reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between
generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained
personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both
single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our
method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior
subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of
controllable multi-subject image synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督分割质量评估方法存在评估粒度粗糙、评估不完整和迁移性差的问题，需要一种更全面、精细的评估方案。

Method: 将SQA重新定义为四类全景分割任务，使用改进的SAM架构，通过交叉注意力整合输入掩码作为提示，并引入边缘引导压缩分支和增强混合采样训练策略。

Conclusion: SegAssess通过PQM范式为无监督分割质量评估提供了一个鲁棒且可迁移的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: High-quality image segmentation is fundamental to pixel-level geospatial
analysis in remote sensing, necessitating robust segmentation quality
assessment (SQA), particularly in unsupervised settings lacking ground truth.
Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show
potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete
assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this
paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for
comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning
framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a
fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within
a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive
(FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby
generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything
Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt
for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include
an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF)
module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented
Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to
significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability.
Comprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate
that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits
remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via
SegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA. The code

*Hiyam Debary,Mustansar Fiaz,Levente Klein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PrediTree是首个用于亚米级分辨率树高预测的开源数据集，包含314万张图像，结合高分辨率LiDAR树高图和时空对齐的多光谱影像，支持深度学习模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决森林监测中基于多时相观测预测树木生长的关键能力缺口，为深度学习提供高质量训练数据。

Method: 提出编码器-解码器框架，利用多时相多光谱影像和相对时间差异来预测冠层高度，采用U-Net架构进行训练。

Result: U-Net架构在PrediTree数据集上获得11.78%的掩码均方误差，比ResNet-50提升约12%，比仅用RGB波段实验误差降低约30%。

Conclusion: PrediTree数据集填补了森林监测领域的重要空白，公开可用且性能优越，为树木生长预测研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: We present PrediTree, the first comprehensive open-source dataset designed
for training and evaluating tree height prediction models at sub-meter
resolution. This dataset combines very high-resolution (0.5m) LiDAR-derived
canopy height maps, spatially aligned with multi-temporal and multi-spectral
imagery, across diverse forest ecosystems in France, totaling 3,141,568 images.
PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by
enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth
based on multiple past observations. %\sout{Initially focused on French
forests, PrediTree is designed as an expanding resource with ongoing efforts to
incorporate data from other countries. } To make use of this PrediTree dataset,
we propose an encoder-decoder framework that requires the multi-temporal
multi-spectral imagery and the relative time differences in years between the
canopy height map timestamp (target) and each image acquisition date for which
this framework predicts the canopy height. The conducted experiments
demonstrate that a U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset provides
the highest masked mean squared error of $11.78\%$, outperforming the next-best
architecture, ResNet-50, by around $12\%$, and cutting the error of the same
experiments but on fewer bands (red, green, blue only), by around $30\%$. This
dataset is publicly available on \href{URL}{HuggingFace}, and both processing
and training codebases are available on \href{URL}{GitHub}.

*Tianwei Ye,Yong Ma,Xiaoguang Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DcMatch是一个无监督学习框架，通过形状图注意力网络和多层次一致性约束，在非刚性多形状匹配中实现了更准确和一致的点对点对应关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多形状匹配方法通常从单个形状学习规范嵌入，难以捕捉整个形状集合的底层流形结构，导致对应关系不够鲁棒和一致。

Method: 使用形状图注意力网络捕捉整个形状集合的流形结构，构建共享潜在空间；同时在空间域和谱域表示对应关系，通过新颖的循环一致性损失在共享宇宙空间中强制执行对齐。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的基准测试中，该方法始终优于先前的最先进方法，在各种多形状匹配场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: DcMatch通过利用整个形状集合的结构信息和双重一致性约束，为非刚性多形状匹配提供了更有效和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple 3D shapes is a
fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we
introduce DcMatch, a novel unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid
multi-shape matching. Unlike existing methods that learn a canonical embedding
from a single shape, our approach leverages a shape graph attention network to
capture the underlying manifold structure of the entire shape collection. This
enables the construction of a more expressive and robust shared latent space,
leading to more consistent shape-to-universe correspondences via a universe
predictor. Simultaneously, we represent these correspondences in both the
spatial and spectral domains and enforce their alignment in the shared universe
space through a novel cycle consistency loss. This dual-level consistency
fosters more accurate and coherent mappings. Extensive experiments on several
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
previous state-of-the-art approaches across diverse multi-shape matching
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YeTianwei/DcMatch.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost
and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of
illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for
generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a
self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various
endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different
tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to
efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In
the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small
amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference,
from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the
training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training
framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and
reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both
realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network
also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on
diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate
endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The code
will be released upon acceptance, while the demo video can be found on here:

Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) encodes visual relationships between objects in
images as graph structures. Thanks to the advances of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), the task of Open-Vocabulary SGG has been recently proposed where models
are evaluated on their functionality to learn a wide and diverse range of
relations. Current benchmarks in SGG, however, possess a very limited
vocabulary, making the evaluation of open-source models inefficient. In this
paper, we propose a new reference-free metric to fairly evaluate the
open-vocabulary capabilities of VLMs for relation prediction. Another
limitation of Open-Vocabulary SGG is the reliance on weakly supervised data of
poor quality for pre-training. We also propose a new solution for quickly
generating high-quality synthetic data through region-specific prompt tuning of
VLMs. Experimental results show that pre-training with this new data split can
benefit the generalization capabilities of Open-Voc SGG models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前肿瘤空间异质性分析方法在连续切片中存在空间错位问题，严重影响病理学原位解释的准确性，需要更精确的虚拟染色技术。

Method: 提出三阶段方法：1）原型驱动的染色模式转移与显式内容-风格解耦；2）GapBridge循环配准-合成框架通过可变形结构对齐桥接H&E和IHC域；3）形变感知对抗学习，生成器和配准网络联合对抗优化风格判别器。

Result: 大量实验证明PRINTER在保持H&E染色细节和虚拟染色保真度方面表现优异，超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该工作为虚拟染色提供了稳健且可扩展的解决方案，推动了计算病理学领域的发展。

Abstract: Tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis requires precise correlation between
Hematoxylin and Eosin H&E morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker
expression, yet current methods suffer from spatial misalignment in consecutive
sections, severely compromising in situ pathological interpretation. In order
to obtain a more accurate virtual staining pattern, We propose PRINTER, a
weakly-supervised framework that integrates PRototype-drIven content and
staiNing patTERn decoupling and deformation-aware adversarial learning
strategies designed to accurately learn IHC staining patterns while preserving
H&E staining details. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) A
prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style
decoupling; and (2) A cyclic registration-synthesis framework GapBridge that
bridges H&E and IHC domains through deformable structural alignment, where
registered features guide cross-modal style transfer while synthesized outputs
iteratively refine the registration;(3) Deformation-Aware Adversarial Learning:
We propose a training framework where a generator and deformation-aware
registration network jointly adversarially optimize a style-focused
discriminator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRINTER effectively
achieves superior performance in preserving H&E staining details and virtual
staining fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a
robust and scalable solution for virtual staining, advancing the field of
computational pathology.

Motivation: 高质量标注数据对文档转换模型至关重要，但手动标注成本高且耗时，现有自动标注方法在处理复杂格式时准确性不足，蒸馏训练会限制模型性能

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 生成大规模多样化合成数据训练初始模型；2) 自改进方法：用微调模型标注真实文档，通过过滤策略验证标注质量，然后在验证数据集上重新训练，迭代提升

Result: 训练出的POINTS-Reader模型超越了多个现有公开和专有模型，即使模型规模相当或更大

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效构建高质量文档提取数据集和模型，特别适用于处理表格、公式和多栏文本等复杂文档格式，模型性能优异

Abstract: High-quality labeled data is essential for training accurate document
conversion models, particularly in domains with complex formats such as tables,
formulas, and multi-column text. However, manual annotation is both costly and
time-consuming, while automatic labeling using existing models often lacks
accuracy in handling such challenging scenarios. Consequently, training student
models by distilling outputs from teacher models can significantly limit their
performance in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a fully
automated, distillation-free framework comprising two stages for constructing
high-quality document extraction datasets and models capable of handling
diverse document formats and layouts. In the first stage, we introduce a method
for generating large-scale, diverse synthetic data, which enables a model to
extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. In
the second stage, we present a self-improvement approach that further adapts
the model, initially trained on synthetic data, to real-world documents.
Specifically, we first use the fine-tuned model to annotate real documents,
then apply a suite of filtering strategies to verify annotation quality, and
finally retrain the model on the verified dataset. By iteratively repeating
this process, we progressively enhance both the model's conversion capabilities
and the quality of the generated data. We train a public POINTS-1.5 model to
obtain POINTS-Reader, which surpasses many existing public and proprietary
models of comparable or larger size. Our model is available at

Result: 在自定义SceneBench基准测试上的广泛实验表明，FantasyHSI在泛化性、长时程任务完成和物理真实性方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FantasyHSI通过多智能体协作和DPO训练，有效解决了HSI中的长时程一致性和物理真实性问题，为复杂场景中的人类行为生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) seeks to generate realistic human behaviors
within complex environments, yet it faces significant challenges in handling
long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. To address
these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on
video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We
model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which
we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene
navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and
a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions.
Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback
mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned
path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the
stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical
consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we
leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator,
significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding.
Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that
FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism. Ours

Abstract: Object detection architectures are notoriously difficult to understand, often
more so than large language models. While RT-DETRv2 represents an important
advance in real-time detection, most existing diagrams do little to clarify how
its components actually work and fit together. In this article, we explain the
architecture of RT-DETRv2 through a series of eight carefully designed
illustrations, moving from the overall pipeline down to critical components
such as the encoder, decoder, and multi-scale deformable attention. Our goal is
to make the existing one genuinely understandable. By visualizing the flow of
tensors and unpacking the logic behind each module, we hope to provide
researchers and practitioners with a clearer mental model of how RT-DETRv2
works under the hood.

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation is a fundamental task in understanding human hands.
However, accurately estimating 3D hand poses remains challenging due to the
complex movement of hands, self-similarity, and frequent occlusions. In this
work, we address two limitations: the inability of existing 3D hand pose
estimation methods to estimate aleatoric (data) uncertainty, and the lack of
uncertainty modeling that incorporates joint correlation knowledge, which has
not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we introduce aleatoric
uncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to
achieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and
computational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a
single linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This
is enabled by formulating the hand joint output space as a probabilistic
distribution, allowing the linear layer to capture joint correlations. Our
proposed parameterization is used as a task head layer, and can be applied as
an add-on module on top of the existing models. Our experiments demonstrate
that our parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing
approaches. Furthermore, the 3D hand pose estimation model equipped with our
uncertainty head achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while
introducing new uncertainty modeling capability to the model. The project page

Method: 提出Point-PQAE交叉重建生成范式，首先生成两个解耦的点云视图，然后从一个视图重建另一个视图。开发了点云视图生成的裁剪机制和新的位置编码来表示两个解耦视图之间的3D相对位置

Result: 在ScanObjectNN的三个变体上，使用Mlp-Linear评估协议，比自重建基线(Point-MAE)分别高出6.5%、7.0%和6.7%

Conclusion: 交叉重建显著增加了预训练的难度，使该方法在3D自监督学习中超越了之前的单模态自重建方法，证明了双视图学习的潜力

Abstract: Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual
labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities
due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing
generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on
recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing
that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity
and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.
Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.
In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative
paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then
reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop
mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further
propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position
between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly
increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which
enables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods
in 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the
self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three
variants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol. The code is

Motivation: 传统图像字幕系统往往生成通用描述，无法捕捉事件级别的语义，这在新闻报导和数字存档等应用中至关重要。现有视觉语言模型通常只关注可见内容，而忽略了时间、社会和历史背景。

Method: ReCap包含三个集成组件：(1)使用DINOv2嵌入的两阶段文章检索系统，先通过全局特征相似性选择候选，再用补丁级互最近邻相似性重新排序；(2)从文章摘要、通用字幕和原始元数据中合成信息的上下文提取框架；(3)基于大语言模型的字幕生成系统，采用语义高斯归一化来提升流畅性和相关性。

Result: 在EVENTA 2025大挑战赛Track 1的OpenEvents V1数据集上评估，ReCap获得了0.54666的总体得分，在私有测试集上排名第二。

Conclusion: ReCap有效弥合了视觉感知与现实世界知识之间的差距，为高风险领域中的上下文感知图像理解提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Image captioning systems often produce generic descriptions that fail to
capture event-level semantics which are crucial for applications like news
reporting and digital archiving. We present ReCap, a novel pipeline for
event-enriched image retrieval and captioning that incorporates broader
contextual information from relevant articles to generate narrative-rich,
factually grounded captions. Our approach addresses the limitations of standard
vision-language models that typically focus on visible content while missing
temporal, social, and historical contexts. ReCap comprises three integrated
components: (1) a robust two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2
embeddings with global feature similarity for initial candidate selection
followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor similarity re-ranking; (2) a
context extraction framework that synthesizes information from article
summaries, generic captions, and original source metadata; and (3) a large
language model-based caption generation system with Semantic Gaussian
Normalization to enhance fluency and relevance. Evaluated on the OpenEvents V1
dataset as part of Track 1 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, ReCap achieved a
strong overall score of 0.54666, ranking 2nd on the private test set. These
results highlight ReCap's effectiveness in bridging visual perception with
real-world knowledge, offering a practical solution for context-aware image
understanding in high-stakes domains. The code is available at

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level
classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between
base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in
discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge,
existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable
performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the
fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored,
making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment
to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under
inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent,
an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to
orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent
semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark
evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance
while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.

Conclusion: 这项工作为利用NAS解决实际应用问题提供了新的视角，首次将NAS引入SAR目标检测领域，展示了NAS在优化检测器架构方面的有效性。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection faces significant challenges
from speckle noise, small target ambiguities, and on-board computational
constraints. While existing approaches predominantly focus on SAR-specific
architectural modifications, this paper explores the application of the
existing lightweight object detector, i.e., YOLOv10, for SAR object detection
and enhances its performance through Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
Specifically, we employ NAS to systematically optimize the network structure,
especially focusing on the backbone architecture search. By constructing an
extensive search space and leveraging evolutionary search, our method
identifies a favorable architecture that balances accuracy, parameter
efficiency, and computational cost. Notably, this work introduces NAS to SAR
object detection for the first time. The experimental results on the
large-scale SARDet-100K dataset demonstrate that our optimized model
outperforms existing SAR detection methods, achieving superior detection
accuracy while maintaining lower computational overhead. We hope this work
offers a novel perspective on leveraging NAS for real-world applications.

Abstract: Detecting objects efficiently from radar sensors has recently become a
popular trend due to their robustness against adverse lighting and weather
conditions compared with cameras. This paper presents an efficient object
detection model for Range-Doppler (RD) radar maps. Specifically, we first
represent RD radar maps with multi-representation, i.e., heatmaps and grayscale
images, to gather high-level object and fine-grained texture features. Then, we
design an additional Adapter branch, an Exchanger Module with two modes, and a
Primary-Auxiliary Fusion Module to effectively extract, exchange, and fuse
features from the multi-representation inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we
construct a supernet with various width and fusion operations in the Adapter
branch for the proposed model and employ a One-Shot Neural Architecture Search
method to further improve the model's efficiency while maintaining high
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model obtains favorable
accuracy and efficiency trade-off. Moreover, we achieve new state-of-the-art
performance on RADDet and CARRADA datasets with mAP@50 of 71.9 and 57.1,
respectively.

TL;DR: 本文提出FSS-TIs方法，通过常微分方程和傅里叶变换构建一体化模块，解决跨域少样本分割中模块独立导致知识流动不畅的问题，在五个不同域数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨域少样本分割方法使用多个独立模块来增强特征表示的跨域泛化能力，但这些模块之间的独立性阻碍了知识的有效流动，难以充分发挥其集体潜力。

Method: 提出基于常微分方程和傅里叶变换的一体化模块FSS-TIs，假设域特定特征和域无关特征的光谱之间存在ODE关系，通过时间间隔序列的迭代变换和随机扰动仿射变换来优化ODE内在参数。

Result: 在五个显著不同域的数据集上进行的实验表明，FSS-TIs优于现有的CD-FSS方法，深入的消融研究进一步验证了其跨域适应性。

Conclusion: FSS-TIs通过ODE和傅里叶变换的统一框架有效解决了跨域少样本分割中的知识流动问题，展现出优异的跨域泛化性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) not only enables the segmentation
of unseen categories with very limited samples, but also improves cross-domain
generalization ability within the few-shot segmentation framework. Currently,
existing CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to
enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations.
However, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of
knowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In
contrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary
differential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally
concise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs
assumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including
amplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic
features. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along
a sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine
transformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the
exploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation
of diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an
optimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we
strictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain
fine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world
few-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from
substantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot
segmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing
CD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain
adaptability of FSS-TIs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出首个端到端框架，联合处理激光雷达超分辨率和语义分割，使用轻量级架构和联合优化，在低成本16通道激光雷达上实现接近64通道高分辨率激光雷达的分割性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率激光雷达成本昂贵限制了大规模部署，而低成本传感器产生的稀疏点云会降低分割精度，需要解决这一矛盾

Method: 采用联合优化训练框架，SR模块融入语义线索并保留细节；提出新的SR损失函数关注感兴趣区域；使用轻量级模型基础SR架构，参数少且易于与分割网络兼容

Result: 实验表明该方法在分割性能上达到与昂贵64通道高分辨率激光雷达相当的水平

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了低成本传感器性能受限的问题，为自动驾驶大规模部署提供了可行的技术方案

Abstract: High-resolution LiDAR data plays a critical role in 3D semantic segmentation
for autonomous driving, but the high cost of advanced sensors limits
large-scale deployment. In contrast, low-cost sensors such as 16-channel LiDAR
produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. To overcome
this, we introduce the first end-to-end framework that jointly addresses LiDAR
super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation. The framework employs joint
optimization during training, allowing the SR module to incorporate semantic
cues and preserve fine details, particularly for smaller object classes. A new
SR loss function further directs the network to focus on regions of interest.
The proposed lightweight, model-based SR architecture uses significantly fewer
parameters than existing LiDAR SR approaches, while remaining easily compatible
with segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method achieves
segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution and
costly 64-channel LiDAR data.

TL;DR: PGRD是一个基于扩散模型的医学图像分割框架，通过学习体素级分布来捕捉分割中的模糊性，同时保持强校准性和采样效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中存在模糊性，需要模型能够捕捉完整的条件分布而不是单一的点估计。

Method: 将离散标签嵌入连续空间作为one-hot目标，使用粗粒度先验预测器提供逐步指导，扩散网络学习先验的残差，并采用深度扩散监督方案稳定训练。

Result: 在MRI和CT数据集上评估，PGRD相比贝叶斯、集成、概率U-Net和普通扩散基线，获得了更高的Dice分数和更低的NLL/ECE值，且需要更少的采样步骤达到强性能。

Conclusion: PGRD框架能够有效处理医学图像分割中的模糊性问题，在保持校准性的同时提高了采样效率。

Abstract: Ambiguity in medical image segmentation calls for models that capture full
conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present
Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns
voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical
sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a
continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior
predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the
residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A
deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising
intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD
achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble,
Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer
sampling steps to reach strong performance.

quality of noisy images, especially those encountered in industrial
environments. [1, 2]. Our focus is on evaluating methods built on supervised

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体数据和智能手机摄像头的普及，传统计算机视觉技术在图像定位方面面临挑战，需要更高效可扩展的解决方案

Method: 使用SigLIP编码器在两个大规模数据集上构建向量数据库，通过检索相似和不同的地理位置信息来增强查询图像提示，再由多模态大语言模型处理

Result: 在三个基准数据集上实现了更高的准确率，达到了最先进的性能水平

Conclusion: 该方法为地理定位任务提供了替代传统从头训练模型的新路径，为GeoAI领域带来了更易获取和可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of
essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based
recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social
media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer
vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet
highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates
open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using
the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query
images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar
geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by
the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three
widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our
solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales
seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in
geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path
to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch,
opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.

Conclusion: AgroSense为精准农业提供了实用、可扩展的实时决策解决方案，为资源受限环境中的轻量级多模态AI系统开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Meeting the increasing global demand for food security and sustainable
farming requires intelligent crop recommendation systems that operate in real
time. Traditional soil analysis techniques are often slow, labor-intensive, and
not suitable for on-field decision-making. To address these limitations, we
introduce AgroSense, a deep-learning framework that integrates soil image
classification and nutrient profiling to produce accurate and contextually
relevant crop recommendations. AgroSense comprises two main components: a Soil
Classification Module, which leverages ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision
Transformer architectures to categorize soil types from images; and a Crop
Recommendation Module, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost,
LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data, including nutrient
levels, pH, and rainfall. We curated a multimodal dataset of 10,000 paired
samples drawn from publicly available Kaggle repositories, approximately 50,000
soil images across seven classes, and 25,000 nutrient profiles for experimental
evaluation. The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, with a precision of 97.8%,
a recall of 97.7%, and an F1-score of 96.75%, while RMSE and MAE drop to 0.32
and 0.27, respectively. Ablation studies underscore the critical role of
multimodal coupling, and statistical validation via t-tests and ANOVA confirms
the significance of our improvements. AgroSense offers a practical, scalable
solution for real-time decision support in precision agriculture and paves the
way for future lightweight multimodal AI systems in resource-constrained
environments.

TL;DR: 医学影像检索方法M3Ret通过统一视觉编码器，支持2D、3D和视频多模态医学数据的统一表征学习，在零样本检索中达到最佳性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前医学影像检索方法对于2D、3D和视频数据需要分离的架构和训练策略的问题，这种模态特定设计限制了扩展性和统一表征的发展

Method: 构建包含867,653个医学影像样本的大规模混合模态数据集，包括2D X光光、超声、RGB内镜视频和3D CT扫描；训练M3Ret统一视觉编码器，不需模态特定自定义；结合生成式(MAE)和对比式(SimDINO)自监督学习范式

Result: 在所有单个模态的零样本图像到图像检索中达到新的最佳性能，超越DINOv3和BMC-CLIP等强基线；在没有成对数据的情况下实现了强劲的跨模态对齐；虽然预训练时从未见过MRI数据，但模型能够演化到未见的MRI任务

Conclusion: M3Ret为多模态医学影像理解领域的基础模型发展提供了有前景的方向，证明了纯粹视觉自监督学习对未见模态的良好演化能力

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is essential for clinical decision-making and
translational research, relying on discriminative visual representations. Yet,
current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and
training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This
modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of
unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale
hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including
2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging
this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any
modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable
representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO)
self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new
state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual
modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised
BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired
data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing
MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual
self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate
the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings
deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret
as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image
understanding.

Result: 在1000个视频测试集上通过自动和人工评估验证，在ACM Multimedia 2025挑战赛中获第一名

Conclusion: TPIGE框架以最小成本实现了性能提升，展现了最先进的性能和强泛化能力

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation creates videos faithful
to both a reference subject image and a text prompt. While fine-tuning large
pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art
results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader
improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance
Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video
description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances
identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal
cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o
to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference
image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an
identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying
conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly
improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware
Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize
identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method
outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a
1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025
Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art
performance and strong generality. The code is available at

Abstract: Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular
technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd
monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy
with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras.
In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based
video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed
by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a
critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To
address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of
camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a
per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset,
augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on
real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results
show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while
respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup
with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

performance in critical applications. Existing Low-light Image Enhancement
(LIE) methods struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including
Ultra-High Resolution (UHR), lack of paired data, severe non-uniform

key deployment factors: speed, resolution, model complexity, and memory
footprint. Third, we develop U3LIE, an efficient framework with two

normalization and a Luminance Interval Loss (L_int) for exposure control. U3LIE
achieves SOTA results, processing 4K images at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU, making
it ideal for real-time on-board deployment. In summary, these contributions

Motivation: 现有方法在处理查询歧义性和视频部分相关性时容易受到虚假语义关联的影响，导致性能不佳

Method: 1) 将视频和查询编码为多元高斯分布进行概率建模 2) 引入可学习的置信门控动态加权相似度

Result: 在多种检索骨干网络上进行的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: RAL框架能够显式建模数据不确定性，提升部分相关视频检索的鲁棒性

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos
partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust
query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from
inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely
characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2)
partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce
contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on
enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant
clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to
distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal
performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning
(RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key
innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding
videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only
quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture
the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the
heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence
gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be
seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments
across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统体素网格在医学成像中存在分辨率限制、拓扑信息丢失和稀疏数据处理效率低的问题，需要更好的稀疏数据表示方法。

Method: 使用神经占用场预测3D点是否在物体内部来表示CT扫描的胸腔，并应用基于拉普拉斯的收缩算法提取胸腔的中轴。

Result: 在RibSeg数据集的20个医学扫描上进行了评估，证明了基于连续坐标的3D场景表示相比基于体素的表示在几何操作中的优势。

Conclusion: 隐式3D表示方法能够更有效地处理稀疏和噪声数据，保持复杂的几何信息，并为形态学操作提供更好的解决方案。

Abstract: We present RibPull, a methodology that utilizes implicit occupancy fields to
bridge computational geometry and medical imaging. Implicit 3D representations
use continuous functions that handle sparse and noisy data more effectively
than discrete methods. While voxel grids are standard for medical imaging, they
suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and
inefficient handling of sparsity. Coordinate functions preserve complex
geometrical information and represent a better solution for sparse data
representation, while allowing for further morphological operations. Implicit
scene representations enable neural networks to encode entire 3D scenes within
their weights. The result is a continuous function that can implicitly
compesate for sparse signals and infer further information about the 3D scene
by passing any combination of 3D coordinates as input to the model. In this
work, we use neural occupancy fields that predict whether a 3D point lies
inside or outside an object to represent CT-scanned ribcages. We also apply a
Laplacian-based contraction to extract the medial axis of the ribcage, thus
demonstrating a geometrical operation that benefits greatly from continuous
coordinate-based 3D scene representations versus voxel-based representations.
We evaluate our methodology on 20 medical scans from the RibSeg dataset, which
is itself an extension of the RibFrac dataset. We will release our code upon
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法主要关注语义控制，但忽视了风格一致性的重要性，这影响了图像的整体美感和连贯性。

Method: 使用先进的扩散模型，包含两个并行交叉注意力机制分别处理文本和风格信息；提出PSRL模块通过风格对比损失学习细粒度风格表示。

Result: 在建立的综合基准测试中，NSD框架在保持风格一致性方面表现出色，实验证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: NSD框架成功解决了图像编辑中的风格一致性问题，为相关研究提供了新的解决方案和评估标准。

Abstract: Maintaining stylistic consistency is crucial for the cohesion and aesthetic
appeal of images, a fundamental requirement in effective image editing and
inpainting. However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control
of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this
consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a
novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified
scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and
stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an
advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms
that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual
objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained
style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational
Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that
different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas
regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs
a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between
representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those
from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols for this task, we establish a comprehensive benchmark.
This benchmark includes competing algorithms, dedicated style-related metrics,
and diverse datasets and settings to facilitate fair comparisons. Extensive
experiments conducted on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

*Uğur Çoğalan,Mojtaba Bemana,Karol Myszkowski,Hans-Peter Seidel,Colin Groth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MILO是一个轻量级的多尺度感知度量方法，用于全参考图像质量评估，通过伪MOS监督训练，在图像和潜在空间中都能作为感知损失函数使用，在多项图像处理任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像质量评估方法需要大规模人工标注数据集，计算成本高，且缺乏对视觉掩蔽效应的建模。需要开发一个轻量级但准确的感知度量方法，既能评估图像质量，又能作为优化工具用于生成任务。

Method: 使用伪MOS监督训练，通过对多样图像应用可重现的失真并使用考虑视觉掩蔽效应的现代质量度量集合进行评分。采用紧凑架构，在图像和潜在域中作为感知损失函数，结合空间掩蔽和课程学习策略进行优化。

Result: MILO在标准FR-IQA基准测试中超越现有度量方法，推理速度快，适合实时应用。在去噪、超分辨率和人脸修复等任务中显著提升性能，同时减少计算开销。

Conclusion: MILO既是先进的图像质量度量工具，也是生成流程中实用的感知优化工具，通过空间掩蔽和课程学习策略实现了高效且感知对齐的优化。

Abstract: We present MILO (Metric for Image- and Latent-space Optimization), a
lightweight, multiscale, perceptual metric for full-reference image quality
assessment (FR-IQA). MILO is trained using pseudo-MOS (Mean Opinion Score)
supervision, in which reproducible distortions are applied to diverse images
and scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual
masking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring
large-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO
outperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast
inference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we
demonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent
domains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when
applied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion,
enables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial
masking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less
relevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more
visually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved
performance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration,
while also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a
state-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual
optimization in generative pipelines.

Abstract: As obesity rates continue to increase, automated calorie tracking has become
a vital tool for people seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a
diet plan. Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue,
existing approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant
caloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges,
challenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on
Western cuisines. In this paper, we propose a tailored solution that
specifically targets Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse
dataset of popular street foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a
refined calorie estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision
model YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification and
segmentation results, with only a slight increase in computational complexity
compared to the base variant. Coupled with a machine learning regression model,
our system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root
mean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making
it both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.

Conclusion: InfoScale通过信息中心化的方法有效解决了扩散模型在可变尺度图像生成中的关键问题，实现了更好的跨分辨率生成性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer
performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training
scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating
variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across
resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for
generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of
three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled
generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.
Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution
generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled
image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3)
The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with
variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose
\textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image
generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects
correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency
Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by
dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information
aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation
module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and
achieve an effective balance between local and global information in
higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3),
we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise
for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and
extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image
generation.

Conclusion: 验证了CNN与选择性SSM结合的协同潜力，为精细视觉理解任务提供了强大的新架构范式

Abstract: The computational assessment of facial attractiveness, a challenging
subjective regression task, is dominated by architectures with a critical
trade-off: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer efficiency but have
limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) model global context
at a quadratic computational cost. To address this, we propose Mamba-CNN, a
novel and efficient hybrid architecture. Mamba-CNN integrates a lightweight,
Mamba-inspired State Space Model (SSM) gating mechanism into a hierarchical
convolutional backbone. This core innovation allows the network to dynamically
modulate feature maps and selectively emphasize salient facial features and
their long-range spatial relationships, mirroring human holistic perception
while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments
on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, where our model sets a new
state-of-the-art. Mamba-CNN achieves a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9187, a
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2022, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of
0.2610. Our findings validate the synergistic potential of combining CNNs with
selective SSMs and present a powerful new architectural paradigm for nuanced
visual understanding tasks.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce
concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in
sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game,
along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary
generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing
the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of
publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for
sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a
benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches
from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced
from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model
specifically designed for this task, which achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 in
the test set. Furthermore, we propose a new metric constrained by the length of
each target summary, enabling a more objective evaluation of the generated
content. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Images vary in how memorable they are to humans. Inspired by findings from
cognitive science and computer vision, this paper explores the correlates of
image memorability in pretrained vision encoders, focusing on latent
activations, attention distributions, and the uniformity of image patches. We
find that these features correlate with memorability to some extent.
Additionally, we explore sparse autoencoder loss over the representations of
vision transformers as a proxy for memorability, which yields results
outperforming past methods using convolutional neural network representations.
Our results shed light on the relationship between model-internal features and
memorability. They show that some features are informative predictors of what
makes images memorable to humans.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for 3D hair reconstruction from single
photographs based on a global hair prior combined with local optimization.
Capturing strand-based hair geometry from single photographs is challenging due
to the variety and geometric complexity of hairstyles and the lack of ground
truth training data. Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo
only reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of
hairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing
methods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data,
however, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work
from skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic
renderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real
and synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we
train a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of
the internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process
to model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible
hair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D
structure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a
Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one
or more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing
reconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance
of our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and
backside consistency. For additional results and code, please refer to

TL;DR: PointSlice是一种新颖的点云处理方法，通过将3D点云水平切片转换为多组2D数据，结合切片交互网络(SIN)保持垂直关系，在保持高精度的同时显著提升推理速度和减少参数量。

Result: 在Waymo数据集上比SAFDNet快1.13倍，参数量减少0.79倍，精度仅降低1.2 mAPH；在nuScenes数据集达到66.74 mAP的SOTA结果；在Argoverse 2数据集快1.10倍，参数量减少0.66倍，精度降低1.0 mAP。

Conclusion: PointSlice成功实现了3D目标检测中精度与速度的良好平衡，通过创新的2D切片处理和垂直关系保持机制，在多个数据集上证明了其优越性能。

Abstract: 3D object detection from point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous
driving. Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are
voxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy
through fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference
speeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of
voxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel
point cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the
horizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main
contributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique
that converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The
model only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as
separate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and
enhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network
(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN
into the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception
capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high
detection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is
1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art
voxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the
nuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP.
On the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer
parameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at

Abstract: Fast and accurate 3D shape generation from point clouds is essential for
applications in robotics, AR/VR, and digital content creation. We introduce
ConTiCoM-3D, a continuous-time consistency model that synthesizes 3D shapes
directly in point space, without discretized diffusion steps, pre-trained
teacher models, or latent-space encodings. The method integrates a
TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule with a Chamfer Distance-based
geometric loss, enabling stable training on high-dimensional point sets while
avoiding expensive Jacobian-vector products. This design supports efficient
one- to two-step inference with high geometric fidelity. In contrast to
previous approaches that rely on iterative denoising or latent decoders,
ConTiCoM-3D employs a time-conditioned neural network operating entirely in
continuous time, thereby achieving fast generation. Experiments on the ShapeNet
benchmark show that ConTiCoM-3D matches or outperforms state-of-the-art
diffusion and latent consistency models in both quality and efficiency,
establishing it as a practical framework for scalable 3D shape generation.

Motivation: nnUNet框架虽然能自动调整训练脚本中的大多数超参数，但忽略了分割网络内部超参数的调优，这限制了模型的泛化能力。需要一种能够根据不同数据集特征动态调整的方法。

Abstract: The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in
training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal
hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the
model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents
a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of
the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different
datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module,
to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps.
Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key
components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the
Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the
ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during
the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could
potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder,
utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs
varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the
decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature
maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by
this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving
Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the
Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets,

image segmentation tasks across various datasets.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in multimodal understanding tasks. However, the increasing demand
for high-resolution image and long-video understanding results in substantial
token counts, leading to reduced inference efficiency. Token compression offers
a direct solution by reducing the number of tokens to be processed, thereby
improving computational efficiency. Through extensive analysis, we identify two
critical limitations in existing inner-LLM token compression methods:
positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators, which hinder
their practical deployment for LVLM acceleration. This paper presents the first
approach from a token variation perspective, revealing that visual token
variations within LLMs exhibit task-agnostic properties. We propose
Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{V$^2$Drop}),
which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM
inference, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments
across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that our V$^2$Drop is able to
maintain \textbf{94.0\%} and \textbf{98.6\%} of the original model performance
for image and video understanding tasks respectively, while reducing LLM
generation latency by \textbf{31.5\%} and \textbf{74.2\%}. When combined with
efficient operators, V$^2$Drop further reduces GPU peak memory usage.

Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools
in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large
labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology,
these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable
clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of
publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation
formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a
volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in
classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework.
By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum
achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark
by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models.
The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed
evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT
datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous
annotations and body segmentation to enhance model performance, setting a new
direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.

Method: 采用向量量化变分自编码器(VQ-VAE)将含噪超声图像编码到低维潜在空间，然后使用潜在扩散模型迭代去除干扰，最后解码重建高分辨率无干扰图像。

Result: 在体外实验中，HIFU-ILDiff的SSIM达到0.796，PSNR达到23.780，显著优于陷波滤波器的SSIM 0.443和PSNR 14.420，且处理速度达到15帧/秒。

Conclusion: HIFU-ILDiff能够实时去噪HIFU干扰，提高HIFU治疗的监测精度，有望在临床应用中显著改善治疗精确性。

Abstract: High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive therapeutic
technique widely used for treating various diseases. However, the success and
safety of HIFU treatments depend on real-time monitoring, which is often
hindered by interference when using ultrasound to guide HIFU treatment. To
address these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based
approach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced
interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images
into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model
that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then
decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We
constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro
phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging
modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental
results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly
used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of
0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443
and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally,
HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly
faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate
that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding
images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve
the treatment precision in current clinical applications.

TL;DR: Keye-VL-1.5是一个创新的多模态大语言模型，通过慢快视频编码策略、渐进式预训练和综合后训练流程，显著提升了视频理解能力，在多个基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在处理视频内容时面临空间分辨率和时间覆盖之间的权衡难题，视频理解仍然是多模态任务中的挑战性领域。

Method: 1. 新颖的慢快视频编码策略：基于帧间相似性动态分配计算资源；2. 渐进式四阶段预训练：从8K扩展到128K tokens的上下文长度；3. 综合后训练流程：包括5步思维链数据构建、迭代GSPO强化学习和对齐训练。

Result: 在公共基准测试和严格的人工评估中，Keye-VL-1.5相比现有模型有显著改进，在视频理解任务中表现优异，同时在通用多模态基准上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: Keye-VL-1.5通过三项关键技术创新有效解决了视频理解的核心挑战，为多模态视频处理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks
through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding
remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of
videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution
and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5,
which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key
innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that
dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity,
processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution
(Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal
coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive
four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's
context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and
more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training
pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment,
incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative
GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult
cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public
benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates
significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video
understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general
multimodal benchmarks.

TL;DR: ViSTA-SLAM是一个无需相机内参的实时单目视觉SLAM系统，采用轻量级对称双视图关联模型作为前端，后端构建专门的Sim(3)位姿图，在相机追踪和稠密3D重建方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统视觉SLAM系统需要相机内参的限制，开发一个能够广泛适用于不同相机设置的实时单目SLAM系统。

Method: 前端使用轻量级对称双视图关联(STA)模型，仅从两张RGB图像同时估计相对相机位姿和回归局部点云图；后端构建包含闭环检测的Sim(3)位姿图来处理累积漂移。

Result: 系统前端模型大小仅为同类最先进方法的35%，同时提高了管道中使用的双视图约束质量，在相机追踪和稠密3D重建质量方面表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: ViSTA-SLAM提供了一个高效且通用的视觉SLAM解决方案，无需相机内参即可实现高质量的实时定位与建图，适用于各种相机配置。

Abstract: We present ViSTA-SLAM as a real-time monocular visual SLAM system that
operates without requiring camera intrinsics, making it broadly applicable
across diverse camera setups. At its core, the system employs a lightweight
symmetric two-view association (STA) model as the frontend, which
simultaneously estimates relative camera poses and regresses local pointmaps
from only two RGB images. This design reduces model complexity significantly,
the size of our frontend is only 35\% that of comparable state-of-the-art
methods, while enhancing the quality of two-view constraints used in the
pipeline. In the backend, we construct a specially designed Sim(3) pose graph
that incorporates loop closures to address accumulated drift. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in both
camera tracking and dense 3D reconstruction quality compared to current
methods. Github repository: https://github.com/zhangganlin/vista-slam

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在视频编辑中需要为不同编辑任务设计不同的控制信号，导致模型设计复杂且需要大量训练资源，需要一种统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出O-DisCo-Edit框架，包含基于随机和自适应噪声的对象失真控制信号，以及复制形式保护模块来保持未编辑区域，采用有效的训练范式。

Result: 大量实验和综合人工评估表明，O-DisCo-Edit在各种视频编辑任务中超越了专业化和多任务的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一的控制信号表示实现了灵活多样的视频编辑，在效率和保真度方面都表现出色，为可控视频编辑提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video editing, yet controllable
editing remains challenging due to the need for precise manipulation of diverse
object properties. Current methods require different control signal for diverse
editing tasks, which complicates model design and demands significant training
resources. To address this, we propose O-DisCo-Edit, a unified framework that
incorporates a novel object distortion control (O-DisCo). This signal, based on
random and adaptive noise, flexibly encapsulates a wide range of editing cues
within a single representation. Paired with a "copy-form" preservation module
for preserving non-edited regions, O-DisCo-Edit enables efficient,
high-fidelity editing through an effective training paradigm. Extensive
experiments and comprehensive human evaluations consistently demonstrate that
O-DisCo-Edit surpasses both specialized and multitask state-of-the-art methods
across various video editing tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过Panel-of-Peers学习框架，利用多个LVLM模型进行同伴评估和迭代自我改进，提升模型性能而不需大量人工标注数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统对齐方法依赖成本高昂的人类偏好数据、机器生成数据质量有限以及自监督数据容易引入幻觉的问题

Method: 受人类协作学习启发，构建一个LVLM模型委员会，通过迭代过程进行输出生成、评估和精炼，模拟同伴审查和教室学习环境

Result: 在15个标准测试集上平均分数从48%提升到57%，显著提升模型性能

Conclusion: Panel-of-Peers学习框架作为一种可扩展的自监督对齐替代方案具有强大潜力，能够在不依赖大量人工标注数据的情况下有效提升LVLM模型的性能

Abstract: Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs)
primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference
data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and
self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework
inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a
panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs
through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review
system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a
curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We
demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring
extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as
a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that
Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to
57%

*Natalia Frumkin,Diana Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Sched是一种新的后训练量化方法，通过调整扩散模型调度器而非模型权重，在4倍模型压缩下实现全精度准确度，显著提升few-step扩散模型的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型计算成本高昂，few-step方法虽然减少了去噪步骤但仍依赖大型未压缩模型，现有量化方法需要全精度校准，限制了在资源受限设备上的应用。

Method: 提出Q-Sched范式，通过修改扩散模型调度器来调整few-step采样轨迹；设计JAQ损失函数，结合文本-图像兼容性和图像质量指标，实现无需参考的无监督量化感知预调节系数学习。

Result: 相比FP16 4步潜在一致性模型提升15.5% FID，相比FP16 8步分阶段一致性模型提升16.6% FID；大规模用户研究（超过80,000个标注）在FLUX.1和SDXL-Turbo上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 量化与few-step蒸馏在高保真生成中具有互补性，Q-Sched为资源受限环境下的高效扩散模型推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring
dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance,
Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a
2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step
diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on
large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often
too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These
requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely
on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for
post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather
than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched
achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn
quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,
which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for
fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of
calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.
Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16
4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step
Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation
are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with
more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both
FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.

TL;DR: OpenVision 2简化了原版架构，移除文本编码器和对比损失，仅保留生成式标题损失，在保持性能的同时显著提升训练效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升OpenVision的训练效率，减少训练时间和内存消耗，同时保持多模态性能。

Method: 移除文本编码器和对比损失，仅使用生成式标题损失进行纯生成式训练，简化架构设计。

Result: 训练时间减少1.5倍（83h→57h），内存使用减少1.8倍（24.5GB→13.8GB），批大小从2k增至8k，参数量可扩展至10亿以上，性能与原版相当。

Conclusion: 轻量级纯生成式范式对未来多模态基础模型中视觉编码器的发展具有重要价值。

Abstract: This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss
design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior
vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal
designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder
(and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a
purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The
initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2
competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of
multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory
consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x
(from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB,
equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This
superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest
vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We
hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is
compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation
models.

Abstract: Visual reasoning, a cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex
perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems.
While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various
perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains
challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models
via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such
as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance
multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through
reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO,
designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench,
BLINK and MMStar, significantly outperforming the supervised and text-based RL
finetuning baselines. Notably, Our ReVPT-3B and ReVPT-7B outperform the
instruct models by 9.03% and 9.44% on CV-Bench. Finally, we bring to the
community new insights on RL-based visual tool-usage through extensive

Abstract: Photorealistic and controllable human avatars have gained popularity in the
research community thanks to rapid advances in neural rendering, providing fast
and realistic synthesis tools. However, a limitation of current solutions is
the presence of noticeable blurring. To solve this problem, we propose
GaussianGAN, an animatable avatar approach developed for photorealistic
rendering of people in real-time. We introduce a novel Gaussian splatting
densification strategy to build Gaussian points from the surface of cylindrical
structures around estimated skeletal limbs. Given the camera calibration, we
render an accurate semantic segmentation with our novel view segmentation
module. Finally, a UNet generator uses the rendered Gaussian splatting features
and the segmentation maps to create photorealistic digital avatars. Our method
runs in real-time with a rendering speed of 79 FPS. It outperforms previous
methods regarding visual perception and quality, achieving a state-of-the-art
results in terms of a pixel fidelity of 32.94db on the ZJU Mocap dataset and

Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
multi-label classification of multispectral images using ResNet50 and DINOv2,
acknowledging the high dimensionality of such data and the associated
processing challenges. Multi-label classification, where each image may belong
to multiple classes, adds further complexity to feature extraction. Our
pipeline includes an optional PCA step that reduces the data to three
dimensions before feeding it into a three-layer classifier. The findings
demonstrate that the effectiveness of PCA for multi-label multispectral image
classification depends strongly on the chosen deep learning architecture and
training strategy, opening avenues for future research into self-supervised
pre-training and alternative dimensionality reduction approaches.

Abstract: Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical

influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an
enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with
both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the
foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces
self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention
to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model
to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual
relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy
and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and
compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the
incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models
capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures

Abstract: Remote sensing is critical for disaster monitoring, yet existing datasets

Remote Sensing Change Caption (RSCC) dataset, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 62,315 pre-/post-disaster image pairs (spanning earthquakes, floods,

bi-temporal understanding. Our results highlight RSCC's ability to facilitate
detailed disaster-related analysis, paving the way for more accurate,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于临床元数据的两阶段扩散框架，用于解决有限角度CT重建中的伪影问题，通过元数据引导生成先验并确保物理一致性，显著提升了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限角度CT虽然能提高时间分辨率和降低辐射剂量，但由于投影截断会产生严重伪影，需要解决其病态重建问题。临床元数据（采集参数、患者人口统计和诊断印象）可能提供有价值的先验信息来改善重建质量。

Method: 两阶段扩散框架：第一阶段使用基于transformer的扩散模型，仅依赖元数据从噪声生成粗略解剖先验；第二阶段整合粗略先验和元数据进一步细化图像。两个阶段都使用ADMM模块在每一步采样中强制执行基于物理的数据一致性。

Result: 在合成和真实心脏CT数据集上的实验表明，引入元数据显著提高了重建保真度，特别是在严重角度截断情况下。相比无元数据的基线方法，在SSIM、PSNR、nMI和PCC指标上均取得更优性能。消融研究证实不同类型元数据具有互补优势。

Conclusion: 临床元数据在提高重建质量和效率方面具有双重作用，支持将其整合到未来的元数据引导医学成像框架中。该方法为有限角度CT重建提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers improved temporal resolution
and reduced radiation dose for cardiac imaging, but suffers from severe
artifacts due to truncated projections. To address the ill-posedness of LACT
reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured
clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model
conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient
demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors
from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the
coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data
consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the
measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac
CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves
reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared
to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance
in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of
metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and
demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the
dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and
efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical
imaging frameworks.

semi-supervised few-shot learning to address the scarcity of labeled AM defect
data. By effectively leveraging both labeled and unlabeled novel-class images,
TransMatch circumvents the limitations of previous meta-learning approaches.
Experimental evaluations on a Surface Defects dataset of 8,284 images
demonstrate the efficacy of TransMatch, achieving 98.91% accuracy with minimal
loss, alongside high precision, recall, and F1-scores for multiple defect
classes. These findings underscore its robustness in accurately identifying
diverse defects, such as cracks, pinholes, holes, and spatter. TransMatch thus
represents a significant leap forward in additive manufacturing defect
detection, offering a practical and scalable solution for quality assurance and
reliability across a wide range of industrial applications.

TL;DR: 提出平衡信息瓶颈(BIB)和混合平衡信息瓶颈(MBIB)方法，通过损失函数重平衡和自蒸馏技术解决长尾视觉识别问题，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界视觉识别数据通常呈现长尾分布，给深度神经网络的高效训练和部署带来挑战。信息瓶颈方法虽然优雅，但需要适应长尾数据场景

Method: 将损失函数重平衡和自蒸馏技术集成到原始信息瓶颈网络中，提出BIB方法；进一步提出MBIB结构，多个BIB负责组合不同网络层的知识，实现端到端学习

Result: 在CIFAR100-LT、ImageNet-LT和iNaturalist 2018等常用长尾数据集上，BIB和MBIB都达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 所提出的BIB和MBIB方法能够学习到充分且保留完整标签相关信息的表示，有效解决了长尾视觉识别问题

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in various
applications with large-scale and balanced data. However, data in real-world
visual recognition are usually long-tailed, bringing challenges to efficient
training and deployment of DNNs. Information bottleneck (IB) is an elegant
approach for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a balanced
information bottleneck (BIB) approach, in which loss function re-balancing and
self-distillation techniques are integrated into the original IB network. BIB
is thus capable of learning a sufficient representation with essential
label-related information fully preserved for long-tailed visual recognition.
To further enhance the representation learning capability, we also propose a
novel structure of mixture of multiple balanced information bottlenecks (MBIB),
where different BIBs are responsible for combining knowledge from different
network layers. MBIB facilitates an end-to-end learning strategy that trains
representation and classification simultaneously from an information theory
perspective. We conduct experiments on commonly used long-tailed datasets,
including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. Both BIB and MBIB
reach state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过在大量领域特定数据集上训练来解决图像光照控制问题，这限制了基础模型的泛化能力和适用性。需要一种更实用、通用的方法来利用现有生成模型的基础知识进行光照控制。

Method: 基于光照关系与自注意力层中token交互相似的洞察，训练轻量级LoRA回归器生成直接辐照度图，使用少量训练图像。然后通过分类器引导将所需光照整合到另一图像的生成过程中。

Conclusion: 这项工作证实了通过利用基础模型知识可以实际可行地控制图像光照，实现了实用和通用的重光照功能。

Abstract: Light control in generated images is a difficult task, posing specific
challenges, spanning over the entire image and frequency spectrum. Most
approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific
datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the
foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach,
effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models
for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are
similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are
best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the
importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA
regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small
set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the
desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier
Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image
domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and
control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works
over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image
lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge,
enabling practical and general relighting.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在空间关系理解方面存在明显不足，需要专门的基准测试来评估和改进这方面的能力。

Method: 创建包含全新真实世界图像-文本对的基准数据集，设计专门测试相对空间关系和物体顺序的任务，并进行解耦分析来分离物体定位和空间推理的贡献。

Result: 结果显示开源和前沿商业VLM在空间关系理解方面表现显著不足，而推理模型表现意外地好。性能瓶颈在于空间推理能力而非物体定位能力。

Conclusion: RocketScience基准揭示了当前VLM在空间关系理解方面的重大缺陷，为改进模型的空间推理能力提供了重要工具和洞见。

Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests
for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world
image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order
of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and
this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial
relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a
surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a
disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization
and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the
performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not
object localization capabilities.

Motivation: 当前基于计算机视觉的空间转录组学分析方法受数据丢失问题限制，现有方法依赖单细胞RNA测序参考，存在对齐质量依赖、外部数据集依赖、批次效应和继承丢失等风险。

Method: 提出LGDiST模型，使用之前被认为无信息的上下文基因构建丰富且具有生物学意义的遗传潜在空间，采用扩散模型框架，包含邻居条件等关键组件。

Result: 在26个数据集上平均MSE降低18%，六种先进方法的基因表达预测性能提升达10%。移除上下文基因、ST潜在空间或邻居条件等关键组件会导致性能显著下降。

Conclusion: LGDiST的完整架构比任何单独组件都能获得显著更好的性能，证明了该方法在解决空间转录组学数据丢失问题上的有效性。

Abstract: Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial
Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially
resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant
limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell
RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and
external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In
this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first
reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that
LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion,
with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene
expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in
MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered
uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space.
Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the
context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to
considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full
architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of
its isolated components.

Conclusion: 这项工作为CAV中基于联邦学习的目标检测提供了首个全面的部署导向评估框架，整合了模型性能、系统级资源分析和环境鲁棒性

Abstract: Object detection is crucial for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to
perceive their surroundings and make safe driving decisions. Centralized
training of object detection models often achieves promising accuracy, fast
convergence, and simplified training process, but it falls short in
scalability, adaptability, and privacy-preservation. Federated learning (FL),
by contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training
across naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, deploying FL in real-world
CAVs remains challenging due to the substantial computational demands of
training and inference, coupled with highly diverse operating conditions.
Practical deployment must address three critical factors: (i) heterogeneity
from non-IID data distributions, (ii) constrained onboard computing hardware,
and (iii) environmental variability such as lighting and weather, alongside
systematic evaluation to ensure reliable performance. This work introduces the
first holistic deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection in
CAVs, integrating model performance, system-level resource profiling, and
environmental robustness. Using state-of-the-art detectors, YOLOv5, YOLOv8,
YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR, evaluated on the KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes
datasets, we analyze trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost,
and resource usage under diverse resolutions, batch sizes, weather and lighting
conditions, and dynamic client participation, paving the way for robust FL
deployment in CAVs.

Abstract: Modern deep learning developments create new opportunities for 3D mapping
technology, scene reconstruction pipelines, and virtual reality development.
Despite advances in 3D deep learning technology, direct training of deep
learning models on 3D data faces challenges due to the high dimensionality
inherent in 3D data and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Structure-from-motion
(SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) exhibit robust
performance when applied to structured indoor environments but often struggle
with ambiguous features in unstructured environments. These techniques often
struggle to generate detailed geometric representations effective for
downstream tasks such as rendering and semantic analysis. Current limitations
require the development of 3D representation methods that combine traditional
geometric techniques with deep learning capabilities to generate robust
geometry-aware deep learning models.
  The dissertation provides solutions to the fundamental challenges in 3D
vision by developing geometric deep learning methods tailored for essential
tasks such as camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth
prediction, and 3D reconstruction. The integration of geometric priors or
constraints, such as including depth information, surface normals, and
equivariance into deep learning models, enhances both the accuracy and
robustness of geometric representations. This study systematically investigates
key components of 3D vision, including camera pose estimation, point cloud
registration, depth estimation, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction,
demonstrating their effectiveness across real-world applications such as
digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.

Abstract: Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition
and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental
monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water
quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and
public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep
learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active
water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored
Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and
Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water.
HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens
monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors,
industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more
than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States
Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System
between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as
a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and
hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer
are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing
architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an
R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for
real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the
current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on
improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its
operational utility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野火强度和频率持续增长，需要创新的计算方法进行快速准确的财产损失评估。传统方法耗时过长，而现代计算机视觉方法通常需要大量标签数据，影响灾后立即部署。

Method: 研究提出了两种零样本流水线：单纯VLM流水线（A）和VLM+大语言模型（LLM）流水线（B）。通过基于特定野火损坏指标的结构化提示，对加州2025年Eaton和Palisades火灾的地面图像进行分析。重点证明了多视角分析在识别细微损坏方面的效果。

Result: 单视角评估的F1分数仅为0.225-0.511，而多视角分析实现了显著提升（F1分数0.857-0.947）。McNemar检验证实多视角分析带来统计上显著的分类改善，但A和B流水线间的改善并不显著。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种即时可部署、灵活且可解释的工作流程，避免了监督学习的需求，显著加快了灾后应急响应人员的分流和优先级判断。未来研究可以深入探索LLM提示在损坏评估中的潜力。

Abstract: The escalating intensity and frequency of wildfires demand innovative
computational methods for rapid and accurate property damage assessment.
Traditional methods are often time consuming, while modern computer vision
approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate
post-disaster deployment. This research introduces a novel, zero-shot framework
leveraging pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to classify damage from
ground-level imagery. We propose and evaluate two pipelines applied to the 2025
Eaton and Palisades fires in California, a VLM (Pipeline A) and a VLM + large
language model (LLM) approach (Pipeline B), that integrate structured prompts
based on specific wildfire damage indicators. A primary scientific contribution
of this study is demonstrating the VLMs efficacy in synthesizing information
from multiple perspectives to identify nuanced damage, a critical limitation in
existing literature. Our findings reveal that while single view assessments
struggled to classify affected structures (F1 scores ranging from 0.225 to
0.511), the multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores
ranging from 0.857 to 0.947). Moreover, the McNemar test confirmed that
pipelines with a multi-view image assessment yields statistically significant
classification improvements; however, the improvements this research observed
between Pipeline A and B were not statistically significant. Thus, future
research can explore the potential of LLM prompting in damage assessment. The
practical contribution is an immediately deployable, flexible, and
interpretable workflow that bypasses the need for supervised training,
significantly accelerating triage and prioritization for disaster response
practitioners.

Abstract: Although large scale models achieve significant improvements in performance,
the overfitting challenge still frequently undermines their generalization
ability. In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as
representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures.
However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces
severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge,
our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method
oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances
robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large
scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By
introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method
effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On
this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark
dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale
architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image
reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating
overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super
resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale
architectures under complex conditions. The code and DroneSR dataset will be

Abstract: Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location
of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as
climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in
geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location
alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the
interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current
concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with
Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal
interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel
framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our
method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and
location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical
climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing
alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into
geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse
geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic
decision-making processes.

Abstract: Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
model, have demonstrated remarkable success in aligning visual and linguistic
representations. However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to
specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic
information distinct from that of natural imagery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to
enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models.
Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that
incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent
structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model
training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and
semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as
a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial
improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning
paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our
findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for
specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within
the broader landscape of vision-language integration.

Conclusion: 基于2D高斯泼溅的图像修复框架成功实现了局部连贯性和全局一致性的平衡，证明了该技术在2D图像处理中的有效性和应用前景。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points
into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D
scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its
untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent
pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the
first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes
incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and
reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The
continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence
in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a
patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates
inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a
pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally
robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide
semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content
remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality,
establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image
processing.

TL;DR: MOSAIC是一个针对多主体个性化生成的表示中心框架，通过显式语义对应和正交特征解耦来解决身份混合和属性泄漏问题，在4+主体情况下仍保持高保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多主体个性化生成在保持身份保真度和语义连贯性方面面临挑战，现有方法由于对主体在共享表示空间中如何交互的建模不足，常出现身份混合和属性泄漏问题

Method: 提出SemAlign-MS数据集提供细粒度语义对应，引入语义对应注意力损失确保精确的点对点语义对齐，开发多参考解耦损失将不同主体推入正交注意力子空间

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，现有方法通常在3个主体以上性能下降，而MOSAIC在4+参考主体情况下仍保持高保真度

Conclusion: MOSAIC为复杂多主体合成应用开辟了新可能性，通过表示层面的精确语义对齐和特征解耦有效解决了多主体生成的核心挑战

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in
maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images
conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from
identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how
different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We
present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject
generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature
disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires
precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which
regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference.
To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset
providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference
subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on
this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to
enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency
from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the
multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal
attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving
individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably,
while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains
high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex
multi-subject synthesis applications.

TL;DR: VARIN是首个为视觉自回归模型设计的基于噪声反转的编辑技术，通过位置感知Argmax反演生成逆Gumbel噪声，实现精确图像重建和文本引导的编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然条件生成已被广泛探索，但无需额外训练即可进行提示引导图像编辑的能力同样重要，因为它支持众多实际应用。

Method: 引入Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN)，利用新颖的位置感知Argmax反演(LAI)伪逆函数生成逆Gumbel噪声，实现源图像精确重建和可控编辑。

Result: 大量实验表明VARIN能有效根据指定提示修改源图像，同时显著保留原始背景和结构细节。

Conclusion: VARIN被验证为一种实用的编辑方法，为VAR模型提供了有效的文本到图像编辑能力。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class
of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in
text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely
explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional
training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world
applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of
VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise
inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN
leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named
Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These
inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate
targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according
to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and
structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing
approach.

*Ziyun Zeng,Junhao Zhang,Wei Li,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Draw-In-Mind (DIM)数据集和模型，通过将设计责任明确分配给理解模块来解决多模态统一模型在图像编辑中的局限性，在较小参数量下实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态统一模型在文本到图像生成方面表现良好，但在精确图像编辑方面仍有困难。作者认为这是由于责任分配不平衡导致的——理解模块仅作为翻译器，而生成模块需要同时承担设计和绘制任务。

Method: 构建DIM数据集（包含14M长上下文图像-文本对和233K GPT-4o生成的思维链想象），连接冻结的Qwen2.5-VL-3B和可训练的SANA1.5-1.6B，通过轻量级两层MLP进行训练。

Result: DIM-4.6B-Edit在ImgEdit和GEdit-Bench基准测试中达到SOTA或竞争性性能，超越了参数量更大的模型如UniWorld-V1和Step1X-Edit。

Conclusion: 将设计责任明确分配给理解模块能显著提升图像编辑性能，证明了该方法在解决多模态模型责任分配不平衡问题上的有效性。

Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a
single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach
achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles
with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced
division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a
translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the
generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring
the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the
new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding
module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning
tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce
Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)
DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex
instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K
chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design
blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable
SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM
dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale,
DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and
GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1
and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the
design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits
for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has achieved unprecedented success in various
computer vision tasks, particularly in object detection. However, the black-box
nature and high complexity of deep neural networks pose significant challenges
for interpretability, especially in critical domains such as autonomous
driving, medical imaging, and security systems. Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) aims to address this challenge by providing tools and
methods to make model decisions more transparent, interpretable, and
trust-worthy for humans. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of
state-of-the-art explain-ability methods specifically applied to object
detection models. The paper be-gins by categorizing existing XAI techniques
based on their underlying mechanisms-perturbation-based, gradient-based,
backpropagation-based, and graph-based methods. Notable methods such as D-RISE,
BODEM, D-CLOSE, and FSOD are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the paper
investigates their applicability to various object detection architectures,
including YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet. Statistical analysis of
publication trends from 2022 to mid-2025 shows an accelerating interest in
explainable object detection, indicating its increasing importance. The study
also explores common datasets and evaluation metrics, and highlights the major
challenges associated with model interpretability. By providing a structured
taxonomy and a critical assessment of existing methods, this review aims to
guide researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable explainability
techniques for object detection applications and to foster the development of
more interpretable AI systems.

TL;DR: Palette-Adapter是一种新颖的方法，通过将调色板解释为稀疏直方图并引入熵和距离控制参数，来改善文本到图像扩散模型在用户指定调色板条件下的生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调色板是创意工作流程中广泛使用的直观工具，但在图像生成中作为条件时会引入显著的模糊性和不稳定性，需要解决这一挑战。

Method: 将调色板解释为稀疏直方图，引入直方图熵和调色板到直方图距离两个标量控制参数，还提出了负直方图机制来抑制不需要的色调，并在精心策划的数据集上进行训练。

Result: 该方法能够在广泛的调色板和提示词范围内实现稳定、语义连贯的生成，在定性、定量评估和用户研究中都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Palette-Adapter通过创新的调色板条件控制机制，成功解决了文本到图像扩散模型中调色板条件的模糊性和不稳定性问题，实现了更好的调色板遵循和图像质量。

Abstract: We introduce the Palette-Adapter, a novel method for conditioning
text-to-image diffusion models on a user-specified color palette. While
palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows,
they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning
image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting
palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters:
histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible
control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further
introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific
undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard
classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the
color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of
rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent
generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method
qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it
consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette
adherence and high image quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于边缘计算的视觉监测框架，通过量化的MobileNet模型在Raspberry Pi上实现新生儿行为状态的实时检测，在保持高准确度的同时具备较低的计算成本，适用于资源受限环境的NICU监护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早产儿死亡率仍然较高，特别是在资源有限的环境中。传统的手动观察或侵入式传感器存在错误多、不实用和可能造成皮肤损伤等问题，需要一种无侵入、自动化的监测方案来提高新生儿状态监测的效率和准确性。

Method: 研究采用量化的MobileNet模型部署在Raspberry Pi上，构建了一个嵌入式监测系统。系统集成了三项关键创新：模型量化技术（减少68%的存储空间）、Raspberry Pi优化的视觉处理流程以及安全的IoT通信协议。通过对公开的新生儿图像数据集进行训练和评估，实现了实时行为状态检测。

Result: 系统在公开数据集上达到了领先的准确率：睡眠检测91.8%，哭哭/正常分类97.7%。通过对比分析发现，虽然更大的模型架构（如ResNet152、VGG19）在准确性上有边际提升，但计算成本过高，不适合实时边缘部署。

Conclusion: 这项研究证明了轻量化优化的模型（如MobileNet）是建立可扩展、低成本且具有临床可行性的NICU监测系统的最佳基础。该框架为改善资源受限环境中早产儿护理提供了可行的解决方案，通过边缘计算实现了高效、安全的实时监测。

Abstract: Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality,
disproportionately affecting low-resource settings with limited access to
advanced neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Continuous monitoring of infant
behavior, such as sleep/awake states and crying episodes, is critical but
relies on manual observation or invasive sensors, which are prone to error,
impractical, and can cause skin damage. This paper presents a novel,
noninvasive, and automated vision-based framework to address this gap. We
introduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet
model deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When
trained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for
crying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency
suitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a
critical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and
diagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures
(e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational
cost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates
three key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68%
reduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT
communication for clinical alerts. This work conclusively shows that
lightweight, optimized models such as the MobileNet offer the most viable
foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring
systems, paving the way for improved preterm care in resource-constrained
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RMOT系统在语言-视觉理解方面取得了进展，但其可靠性和鲁棒性尚未得到充分探索。本文从设计逻辑角度审视RMOT系统的安全影响，识别其对抗性漏洞。

Method: 提出VEIL对抗攻击框架，针对RMOT系统的语言-视觉参考和目标匹配组件进行攻击，特别针对使用FIFO内存的先进RMOT模型，通过时空推理引入持续性错误。

Result: 在Refer-KITTI数据集上的综合评估验证了VEIL的有效性，能够破坏跟踪逻辑可靠性，导致跟踪ID切换和终止。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RMOT系统的严重安全漏洞，强调了在关键大规模应用中需要安全感知的RMOT设计的紧迫性。

Abstract: Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced
perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring
Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT
systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic
description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning
modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction,
temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling
long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations.
Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain
underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT
systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial
vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and
track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel
vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby
targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce
errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames.
We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified
referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted
digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability,
inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL
and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical
large-scale applications.

Conclusion: 合成数据增强训练可以产生更鲁棒和可迁移的视觉表示，但同时也存在局限性，为自监督学习领域提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on
existing self-supervised learning approaches for vision, drawing inspiration
from the adage "fake it till you make it". While contrastive self-supervised
learning has achieved remarkable success, it typically relies on vast amounts
of real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives. To explore
alternatives to these requirements, we investigate two forms of "faking it" in
vision transformers. First, we study the potential of generative models for
unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment
sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic
hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging
contrasts. Our framework - dubbed Syn2Co - combines both approaches and
evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and
transferable visual representations on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures. Our
findings highlight the promise and limitations of synthetic data in
self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work in this direction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ContextFusion阶段和Bootstrap Branch来解决slot attention方法缺乏高层语义信息和无法微调编码器的问题，显著提升了现有模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有slot attention方法存在两个关键局限：(1) 缺乏高层语义信息，仅基于颜色和纹理等低层特征分配图像区域，限制了对象轮廓和形状的理解；(2) 无法微调编码器，需要稳定的特征空间来支持重建，限制了对象中心学习的灵活性。

Method: 提出ContextFusion阶段利用前景和背景的语义信息，引入辅助指示器提供额外上下文线索；设计Bootstrap Branch将特征适应与原始重建阶段解耦，通过引导策略训练特征自适应机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了不同SOTA slot attention模型在模拟和真实数据集上的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的ContextFusion和Bootstrap Branch能够无缝集成到现有slot attention模型中，有效解决了语义信息不足和编码器灵活性受限的问题，推动了对象中心学习的发展。

Abstract: A key human ability is to decompose a scene into distinct objects and use
their relationships to understand the environment. Object-centric learning aims
to mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot
attention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and
has been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot
attention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic
information. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on
low-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly
sensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object
contours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to
fine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space
throughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the
flexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,
both of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.
In the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground
and background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional
contextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level
features. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the
original reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a
feature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental
results show that our method significantly improves the performance of
different SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are
required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data.
Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is
often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the
under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a
data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by
textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized
attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian
images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a
strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which
considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results
on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts
recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model
performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens
zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model,
presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of
attributes of pedestrians in the real world.

TL;DR: SALAD是一种语义感知的判别式逻辑异常检测方法，通过新的组合分支显式建模对象组合图的分布，在MVTec LOCO基准上达到96.1%的图像级AUROC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表面异常检测方法擅长检测结构异常（如凹痕和划痕），但在逻辑异常（如不规则或缺失的对象组件）检测上表现不佳。现有最佳方法依赖聚合预训练特征或手工描述符，丢弃了空间和语义信息。

Method: 提出SALAD方法，包含新设计的组合分支来显式建模对象组合图的分布，学习重要语义关系。还引入了无需手工标签或类别特定信息的组合图提取新流程。

Result: 在标准逻辑异常检测基准MVTec LOCO上显著优于最先进方法，达到96.1%的图像级AUROC。

Conclusion: 通过有效建模组合图分布，SALAD方法在逻辑异常检测方面取得了显著改进，证明了语义感知方法的重要性。

Abstract: Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural
anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies,
such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical
anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or
handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which
discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We
propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection
method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly
model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning
important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure
for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or
category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively
modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon
state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly
detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

Conclusion: NOOUGAT首次实现了任意时间范围的多目标跟踪，在性能和灵活性方面都表现出色，为实际部署提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: The long-standing division between \textit{online} and \textit{offline}
Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to
address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios.
Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted
association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas
\textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on
heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce
NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal
horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that
processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel
Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the
trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of
deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving
\textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on
MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.

Abstract: Hair artifacts in dermoscopic images present significant challenges for
accurate skin lesion analysis, potentially obscuring critical diagnostic
features in dermatological assessments. This work introduces a fine-tuned
SegFormer model augmented with dropout regularization to achieve precise hair
mask segmentation. The proposed SegformerWithDropout architecture leverages the
MiT-B2 encoder, pretrained on ImageNet, with an in-channel count of 3 and 2
output classes, incorporating a dropout probability of 0.3 in the segmentation
head to prevent overfitting. Training is conducted on a specialized dataset of
500 dermoscopic skin lesion images with fine-grained hair mask annotations,
employing 10-fold cross-validation, AdamW optimization with a learning rate of
0.001, and cross-entropy loss. Early stopping is applied based on validation
loss, with a patience of 3 epochs and a maximum of 20 epochs per fold.
Performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics, including
Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS). Experimental results from the cross-validation demonstrate
robust performance, with average Dice coefficients reaching approximately 0.96
and IoU values of 0.93, alongside favorable PSNR (around 34 dB), SSIM (0.97),
and low LPIPS (0.06), highlighting the model's effectiveness in accurate hair
artifact segmentation and its potential to enhance preprocessing for downstream
skin cancer detection tasks.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves identifying various human
attributes from images with applications in intelligent monitoring systems. The
scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR
models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and
diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise
for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the
size and variability of training data. However, the potential of
diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains
underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of
PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness
of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR
tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion;
including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in
diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of
generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion
approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the
zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image
properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection
leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.

Method: 构建CFpano数据集（2700+图像，8000+问答对），提出基于Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)和定制奖励函数的多模态大语言模型。

Result: 在CFpano基准测试中，该方法在多项选择和开放式VQA任务上均达到最优性能，整体性能提升5.37%。

Conclusion: GRPO方法有效，为全景场景理解建立了新基准，CFpano数据集和提出的模型推动了跨帧全景理解的发展。

Abstract: Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream
applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive
environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex
spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods
achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame
correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the
\textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas
visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of
over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the
question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon
our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of
tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame
correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted
with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA
tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories
(\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the
effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene
understanding.

Motivation: 当前TTA基准测试主要关注分布偏移和i.i.d.假设违反，但缺乏对现实场景中时间依赖性的真实模拟，如视频流中连续帧显示相同对象的情况。

Method: 从目标跟踪数据集的边界框收集目标中心图像序列（轨迹）构建ITD数据集，并提出对抗性内存初始化策略来改进基于内存的TTA方法。

Result: ITD数据集成功模拟了真实世界的时间依赖性挑战，实验分析揭示了现有TTA方法在处理时间依赖性时的局限性，提出的对抗性内存初始化策略显著提升了多种方法在挑战性基准上的性能。

Conclusion: ITD数据集填补了当前TTA基准测试在时间依赖性方面的空白，提出的对抗性内存初始化策略有效提升了方法性能，为测试时适应研究提供了更真实的评估平台。

Abstract: We introduce a novel tracklet-based dataset for benchmarking test-time
adaptation (TTA) methods. The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate
challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by
hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus
on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the
customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in
machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic
scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive
frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address
this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call
the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in
ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from
tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes
of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental
analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these
methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we
build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization
strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy
substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging
benchmark.

Conclusion: DSGC-Net通过双流图卷积网络有效解决了人群计数中的密度变化适应和表示一致性问题，显著提升了多视角多姿态场景下的计数精度。

Abstract: Deep learning-based crowd counting methods have achieved remarkable progress
in recent years. However, in complex crowd scenarios, existing models still
face challenges when adapting to significant density distribution differences
between regions. Additionally, the inconsistency of individual representations
caused by viewpoint changes and body posture differences further limits the
counting accuracy of the models. To address these challenges, we propose
DSGC-Net, a Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network based on feature
correlation mining. DSGC-Net introduces a Density Approximation (DA) branch and
a Representation Approximation (RA) branch. By modeling two semantic graphs, it
captures the potential feature correlations in density variations and
representation distributions. The DA branch incorporates a density prediction
module that generates the density distribution map, and constructs a
density-driven semantic graph based on density similarity. The RA branch
establishes a representation-driven semantic graph by computing global
representation similarity. Then, graph convolutional networks are applied to
the two semantic graphs separately to model the latent semantic relationships,
which enhance the model's ability to adapt to density variations and improve
counting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DSGC-Net outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve MAE of 48.9 and 5.9 in
ShanghaiTech Part A and Part B datasets, respectively. The released code is

Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法主要针对自然图像，不适用于遥感图像的数据稀缺、复杂多尺度场景结构和显著分布偏移等挑战。

Method: 提出遥感特定的视觉-语言建模框架，包含空间特征增强、双提示对齐机制（交叉验证场景上下文与细粒度语义的空间-语义一致性）和置信度引导的自训练循环（动态挖掘伪标签扩展训练数据）。

Result: 在多个遥感基准测试中一致优于现有方法，能够以最少标注数据实现高效适应。

Conclusion: 空间-语义集成在遥感OOD检测中具有关键价值，RS-OOD框架为遥感应用提供了可靠的异常模式识别解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection represents a critical challenge in remote
sensing applications, where reliable identification of novel or anomalous
patterns is essential for autonomous monitoring, disaster response, and
environmental assessment. Despite remarkable progress in OOD detection for
natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote
sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and
pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel
framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to
enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key
innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a
dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against
fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a
confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to
expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms
existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables
efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical
value of spatial-semantic integration.

Abstract: Unstructured urban environments present unique challenges for scene
understanding and generalization due to their complex and diverse layouts. We
introduce SynthGenNet, a self-supervised student-teacher architecture designed
to enable robust test-time domain generalization using synthetic multi-source
imagery. Our contributions include the novel ClassMix++ algorithm, which blends
labeled data from various synthetic sources while maintaining semantic
integrity, enhancing model adaptability. We further employ Grounded Mask
Consistency Loss (GMC), which leverages source ground truth to improve
cross-domain prediction consistency and feature alignment. The Pseudo-Label
Guided Contrastive Learning (PLGCL) mechanism is integrated into the student
network to facilitate domain-invariant feature learning through iterative
knowledge distillation from the teacher network. This self-supervised strategy
improves prediction accuracy, addresses real-world variability, bridges the
sim-to-real domain gap, and reliance on labeled target data, even in complex
urban areas. Outcomes show our model outperforms the state-of-the-art (relying
on single source) by achieving 50% Mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) value on

Method: 提出Learn-to-Steer框架，训练轻量级分类器从扩散模型的交叉注意力图中解码空间关系，并将其作为学习到的损失函数在推理时使用；采用双重反转策略避免分类器走捷径检测语言痕迹而非真正的空间模式

Result: 方法显著提高了空间准确性：在FLUX.1-dev上从0.20提升到0.61，在SD2.1上从0.07提升到0.54；能够泛化到多种关系并显著提高准确性

Conclusion: 通过直接从模型内部表征学习目标而非手工设计，Learn-to-Steer有效解决了扩散模型的空间推理问题，为改进文本到图像生成的空间关系准确性提供了新思路

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate stunning visuals, yet they often
fail at tasks children find trivial--like placing a dog to the right of a teddy
bear rather than to the left. When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe
above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods
attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or
test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than
imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these
objectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce
Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for
test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to
train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the
diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a
learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a
surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces
rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion
strategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically
improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to
0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Moreover, our approach generalizes to
multiple relations and significantly improves accuracy.

Abstract: Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to
challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left
out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective
of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via
board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming
capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its
alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned
with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases
and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are
hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that
assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain
deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with
the commonly used benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models are evolving toward multimodal agents
capable of proactively executing tasks. Most agent research focuses on GUI or
embodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual
worlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically
require agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We
initially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance
degeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI
and embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers,
respectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human
brain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor,
designed from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose
Layer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data
by separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing
shallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and
eliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or
embodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces
of GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from
various sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under
different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

Method: 提出ORDAC方法，利用标签分布学习(LDL)建模序数标签的模糊性和不确定性，在训练过程中动态调整每个样本标签分布的均值和标准差，自适应校正噪声标签

Result: 在Adience数据集(40%噪声)上，ORDAC_R将平均绝对误差从0.86降至0.62，召回率从0.37提升至0.49，在原始数据集的内在噪声校正中也表现出色

Conclusion: 使用标签分布进行自适应标签校正是提高序数分类模型在噪声数据下鲁棒性和准确性的有效策略

Abstract: Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning
models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for
ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is
prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the
performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses
the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image
classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal
Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy
labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution
Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in
ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and
standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than
discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and
make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)
and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric
Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions
(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.
For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean
absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to
0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic
noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive
label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance
the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of
noisy data.

Conclusion: GSD-Net能有效处理噪声标注问题，在医学图像分割任务中表现出优异的鲁棒性和性能

Abstract: The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image
segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly
and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain
noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature
learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges,
this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which
integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy
annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically
adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening
supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided
Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a
Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出C33D方法，通过多视图渲染、适配性文本-图像协调和多视图滿散技术，实现了从3D模型和文本描述生成结构一致的新颖3D对象合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本/图像/3D到3D方法在整合多个内容源时常出现纹理不一致和形状不准确的问题，需要一种能够生成结构协调的新颖3D模型的方法。

Method: 首先从输入3D模型渲染多视图和法线图，然后使用前视图和另一对象类别的文本描述，通过ATIH生成新的2D对象。接着使用纹理多视图滿散来优化其他视角的RGB图像纹理，并通过形状多视图滿散提高形状准确性。最后重建完整的3D模型。

Result: 大量实验证明了该方法的有效性，能够生成令人印象深刻的3D创作，如鱼鱼(3D)-鲸鱼(文本)等合成效果。

Conclusion: C33D方法通过简洁但强大的方式，成功解决了3D对象合成中的纹理不一致和形状不准确的挑战，能够生成结构协调的新颖3D模型。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle a new task of 3D object synthesis, where a 3D model
is composited with another object category to create a novel 3D model. However,
most existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate
multiple content sources, often resulting in inconsistent textures and
inaccurate shapes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a straightforward
yet powerful approach, category+3D-to-3D (C33D), for generating novel and
structurally coherent 3D models. Our method begins by rendering multi-view
images and normal maps from the input 3D model, then generating a novel 2D
object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a
text description from another object category as inputs. To ensure texture
consistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the
textures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object.
For enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve
the 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also
conditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to
reconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as
shark(3D)-crocodile(text) in the first row of Fig. 1. A project page is

*Wanyue Zhang,Yibin Huang,Yangbin Xu,JingJing Huang,Helu Zhi,Shuo Ren,Wang Xu,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了多模态大语言模型的空间理解能力，提出了MulSeT基准测试，发现仅增加训练数据无法有效提升空间理解性能，空间理解更依赖于视觉编码器中的位置编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明多模态大语言模型在空间理解方面仍存在困难，但缺乏全面系统的评估。本研究旨在从数据和架构两个角度系统分析MLLMs在单视图、多视图和视频三种场景下的空间理解能力。

Method: 提出了MulSeT基准测试，设计了一系列实验来分析MLLMs的空间推理能力。从数据角度分析训练数据量对性能的影响，从架构角度分析位置编码的重要性。

Result: 空间理解性能随训练数据增加快速收敛，上限较低，特别是需要空间想象的任务。空间理解更依赖于视觉编码器中的位置编码，而非语言模型中的位置编码。

Conclusion: 仅扩展训练数据不足以获得满意的空间理解性能，需要通过架构设计优化空间理解能力，为改进空间推理能力提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is essential for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to support perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied
environments. Despite recent progress, existing studies reveal that MLLMs still
struggle with spatial understanding. However, existing research lacks a
comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these limitations, often restricted
to isolated scenarios, such as single-view or video. In this work, we present a
systematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural
perspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view,
and video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial
Understanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of
spatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the
upper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial
imagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient
to achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we
find that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding
within the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and
native MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future
improvements through architectural design to optimize spatial understanding.
These insights shed light on the limitations of current MLLMs and suggest new
directions for improving spatial reasoning capabilities through data scaling
and architectural tuning.

TL;DR: MedDINOv3是一个将DINOv3视觉基础模型适配到医学图像分割的框架，通过多尺度token聚合架构和领域自适应预训练，在多个分割基准测试中达到或超越最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在医学图像分割中缺乏跨模态和跨机构的泛化能力，视觉基础模型虽然提供强大表示能力，但在医学图像上存在性能不足和领域差距大的挑战。

Method: 设计简单有效的多尺度token聚合架构，在CT-3M数据集（387万张CT切片）上进行多阶段DINOv3领域自适应预训练，学习鲁棒的密集特征。

Result: MedDINOv3在四个分割基准测试中匹配或超越了最先进的性能，证明了视觉基础模型作为医学图像分割统一骨干的潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了视觉基础模型在医学图像分割中的适配问题，为医学图像分析提供了强大的统一骨干网络解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential
for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning
has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking
generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models
(FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and
transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces
two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still
underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large
domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We
introduce \textbf{MedDINOv3}, a simple and effective framework for adapting
DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple
and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform
domain-adaptive pretraining on \textbf{CT-3M}, a curated collection of 3.87M
axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense
features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four
segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation
models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation. The code is

Conclusion: 打破了使用3D卷积处理4D成本体积的经验设计，为解耦聚合范式提供了简单而强大的基线。

Abstract: High-performance real-time stereo matching methods invariably rely on 3D
regularization of the cost volume, which is unfriendly to mobile devices. And
2D regularization based methods struggle in ill-posed regions. In this paper,
we present a deployment-friendly 4D cost aggregation network DBStereo, which is
based on pure 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first provide a thorough
analysis of the decoupling characteristics of 4D cost volume. And design a
lightweight bidirectional geometry aggregation block to capture spatial and
disparity representation respectively. Through decoupled learning, our approach
achieves real-time performance and impressive accuracy simultaneously.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DBStereo outperforms all
existing aggregation-based methods in both inference time and accuracy, even
surpassing the iterative-based method IGEV-Stereo. Our study break the
empirical design of using 3D convolutions for 4D cost volume and provides a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然图像融合技本取得进展，但在保持轻量化模型的同时实现高质量图像融合仍面临重大挑战。需要一种新的框架来解决这个问题。

Method: 提出协同萎精和自我学习框架：1）强化学习代理探索和识别更适合的训练策略；2）以学生性能和教师-学生差距为输入，生成挑战性样本促进学生自我学习；3）动态调整教师指导强度优化知识传递。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够显著提升学生模型性能，与现有技本相比获得更好的图像融合效果。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将强化学习与萎精技本相结合，有效解决了轻量化模型在图像融合任务中的性能挑战，为多模态图像融合提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion plays a critical role in enhancing scene
perception by combining complementary information from different modalities.
Despite recent advances, achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight
models remains a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
collaborative distillation and self-learning framework for image fusion driven
by reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional distillation, this approach not
only enables the student model to absorb image fusion knowledge from the
teacher model, but more importantly, allows the student to perform
self-learning on more challenging samples to enhance its capabilities.
Particularly, in our framework, a reinforcement learning agent explores and
identifies a more suitable training strategy for the student.The agent takes
both the student's performance and the teacher-student gap as inputs, which
leads to the generation of challenging samples to facilitate the student's
self-learning. Simultaneously, it dynamically adjusts the teacher's guidance
strength based on the student's state to optimize the knowledge transfer.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve
student performance and achieve better fusion results compared to existing
techniques.

TL;DR: 一种新的实时虚拟化妆试用框架，通过透明化妆面具提取和图形渲染两步骤，实现了高保真度、身份保持且具有稳定时序一致性的美妆转移效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的美妆转移方法常常无法有效分离半透明化妆品与皮肤颜色和身份特征，导致身份偏移和公平性问题，同时缺乏实时能力和时序一致性，限制了实际应用。

Method: 将美妆转移解耦为两个步骤：透明化妆面具提取和图形学基础的面具渲染。使用伪真实数据训练提取模型，通过图形渲染流程和无监督k-means聚类方法生成训练数据。采用专门的训练目标，包括alpha加权重建损失和唇彩颜色损失来提升透明度估计和颜色保真度。

Result: 该方法在多样化姿势、表情和皮肤颜色情况下都能实现稳健的美妆转移，同时保持时序平滑性。大量实验证明，该方法在抓取细节、维持时序稳定性和保持身份完整性方面都超过了现有基准方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过解耦化设计和专门的训练技术，成功解决了实时虚拟化妆试用中的关键挑战，为实际应用提供了高效、高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time virtual makeup try-on that
achieves high-fidelity, identity-preserving cosmetic transfer with robust
temporal consistency. In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to
synthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained
makeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle
to disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify
features, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore,
current methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal
consistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we
decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and
graphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup
rendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our
makeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two
complementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised
k-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and
color fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including
alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses. Our method achieves robust
makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while
preserving temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining
temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.

Motivation: 监测河流和地表水在精细时空尺度上具有挑战性，特别是对于窄河或泥沙含量高的河流，低分辨率卫星数据难以准确捕捉。

Method: 通过计算机科学和水文学专家合作开发高分辨率数据集，包含专家标注的河流和地表水掩码，并与多种卫星数据配准，评估不同深度学习架构和预训练策略。

Result: 建立了首个全球高分辨率河流宽度估算基准，中位误差为7.2米，显著优于现有卫星衍生方法。最佳模型结合了迁移学习和多光谱通道使用。

Conclusion: RiverScope为精细尺度和多传感器水文建模提供了宝贵资源，支持气候适应和可持续水资源管理。

Abstract: Surface water dynamics play a critical role in Earth's climate system,
influencing ecosystems, agriculture, disaster resilience, and sustainable
development. Yet monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and
temporal scales remains challenging -- especially for narrow or sediment-rich
rivers that are poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data. To address
this, we introduce RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset developed through
collaboration between computer science and hydrology experts. RiverScope
comprises 1,145 high-resolution images (covering 2,577 square kilometers) with
expert-labeled river and surface water masks, requiring over 100 hours of
manual annotation. Each image is co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and the
SWOT River Database (SWORD), enabling the evaluation of cost-accuracy
trade-offs across sensors -- a key consideration for operational water
monitoring. We also establish the first global, high-resolution benchmark for
river width estimation, achieving a median error of 7.2 meters -- significantly
outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. We extensively evaluate deep
networks across multiple architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers),
pretraining strategies (e.g., supervised and self-supervised), and training
datasets (e.g., ImageNet and satellite imagery). Our best-performing models
combine the benefits of transfer learning with the use of all the multispectral
PlanetScope channels via learned adaptors. RiverScope provides a valuable
resource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting
climate adaptation and sustainable water management.

Conclusion: 该方法成功自动化了视频合成过程，通过创新的DiT架构和训练策略，为视频创作提供了高效、高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production,
serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production.
Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration,
resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this
issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video
compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion
information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner,
allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes
of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel
Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To
maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a
light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token
injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion
block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective
foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and
foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a
novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE).
Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task,
called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality
target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes
generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in
fidelity and consistency.

Abstract: In this paper, we rethink text-to-avatar generative models by proposing TeRA,
a more efficient and effective framework than the previous SDS-based models and
general large 3D generative models. Our approach employs a two-stage training
strategy for learning a native 3D avatar generative model. Initially, we
distill a decoder to derive a structured latent space from a large human
reconstruction model. Subsequently, a text-controlled latent diffusion model is
trained to generate photorealistic 3D human avatars within this latent space.
TeRA enhances the model performance by eliminating slow iterative optimization
and enables text-based partial customization through a structured 3D human
representation. Experiments have proven our approach's superiority over
previous text-to-avatar generative models in subjective and objective
evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的各向异性傅里叶特征位置编码(AFPE)，用于解决医学图像中传统位置编码在处理各向异性高维数据时的局限性，在多个医学影像任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中复杂的器官形状和各向异性的高维图像特性使得传统Transformer位置编码(如正弦位置编码和各向同性傅里叶特征编码)在处理这些数据时表现不佳，需要专门针对医学影像特点设计的位置编码方法。

Method: 提出了各向异性傅里叶特征位置编码(AFPE)，这是对各向同性傅里叶特征编码的泛化，能够整合各向异性、类别特定和领域特定的空间依赖关系。

Result: 在胸部X光多标签分类、CT器官分类和超声心动图射血分数回归等任务上的系统评测表明，AFPE在所有测试的各向异性设置中都显著优于最先进的位置编码方法。

Conclusion: 对于各向异性的医学图像和视频，选择适合数据和目标形状的各向异性位置编码至关重要，AFPE为此类任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The adoption of Transformer-based architectures in the medical domain is
growing rapidly. In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as
organs, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often
anisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In
this study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),
arguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific
challenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have
proven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean
distances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional
Encodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,
but they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these
limitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),
a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and
domain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against
commonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ
classification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in
echocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can
significantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on
the shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally,
our proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested
anisotropic settings. We conclude that, in anisotropic medical images and
videos, it is of paramount importance to choose an anisotropic PE that fits the
data and the shape of interest.

Abstract: Fitness movement recognition, a focused subdomain of human activity
recognition (HAR), plays a vital role in health monitoring, rehabilitation, and
personalized fitness training by enabling automated exercise classification
from video data. However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on
computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or
resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we present a lightweight and
effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT)
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention.
These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures
temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative
segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset,
achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration.
Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several
state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and
real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader
applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.

Motivation: 现有MRI图像分割方法主要采用集中式多模态范式，不适用于工程中非集中式混合模态医疗场景。分布式客户端（医院）处理多种混合MRI模态，每个客户端的模态集合和图像数据都不同，存在严重的客户端间模态异质性和数据异质性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够促进来自分布式客户端的异构数据和模态的稳定自适应联邦聚合，并补偿每个本地客户端中不完整的模态，有利于混合模态联邦学习过程中的模态聚合和融合。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation is crucial in diagnosing
and treating many diseases, such as brain tumors. Existing MRI image
segmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which
is inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In
this situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI
modalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse,
suffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI
image segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves
multiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It
distinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and
cross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel
modality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework
(MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality
decoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the
modality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored
and modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating,
corresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating,
respectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of
heterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the
modality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes
dynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for
incomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality
aggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive
experiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

Method: 扩展自监督预训练模型DINOSAUR，通过检索无相机运动的视频帧进行无监督光流运动分割，生成高质量伪标签来精炼slot表示，并训练slot停用模块来区分前景和背景。

Result: 在TRI-PD和KITTI数据集上取得了强大的多目标发现结果，性能优于之前的state-of-the-art方法，尽管是完全无监督的。

Conclusion: MR-DINOSAUR展示了概念简单但有效的完全无监督多目标发现方法，通过运动精炼策略显著提升了无监督学习性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-object discovery (MOD) aims to detect and localize
distinct object instances in visual scenes without any form of human
supervision. Recent approaches leverage object-centric learning (OCL) and
motion cues from video to identify individual objects. However, these
approaches use supervision to generate pseudo labels to train the OCL model. We
address this limitation with MR-DINOSAUR -- Motion-Refined DINOSAUR -- a
minimalistic unsupervised approach that extends the self-supervised pre-trained
OCL model, DINOSAUR, to the task of unsupervised multi-object discovery. We
generate high-quality unsupervised pseudo labels by retrieving video frames
without camera motion for which we perform motion segmentation of unsupervised
optical flow. We refine DINOSAUR's slot representations using these pseudo
labels and train a slot deactivation module to assign slots to foreground and
background. Despite its conceptual simplicity, MR-DINOSAUR achieves strong
multi-object discovery results on the TRI-PD and KITTI datasets, outperforming
the previous state of the art despite being fully unsupervised.

TL;DR: 通过分析VGGT模型的性能瓶颈和关注地图出现的token摘要现象，提出FastVGGT方案，采用训练免的token合并机制在3D视觉模型中实现4倍速度提升，同时缓解长序列输入下的错误累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基础模型在3D视觉中处理长序列图像输入时的推理效率低下问题，特别是VGGT模型的性能瓶颈和token摘要现象。

Method: 提出FastVGGT，首次在3D领域应用token合并技术，设计了专门适配3D架构和任务的token分区策略，通过训练免的机制消除冗余计算保持重建能力。

Result: 在多个3D几何测试集上验证有效性，在1000张输入图像时实现4倍速度提升，同时缓解了长序列场景下的错误累积。

Conclusion: token合并技术作为一种原理性解决方案，具有构建可扩展3D视觉系统的潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, scaling these models to long-sequence
image inputs remains a significant challenge due to inference-time
inefficiency. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of VGGT, a
state-of-the-art feed-forward visual geometry model and identify its primary
bottleneck. Visualization further reveals a token collapse phenomenon in the
attention maps. Motivated by these findings, we explore the potential of token
merging in the feed-forward visual geometry model. Owing to the unique
architectural and task-specific properties of 3D models, directly applying
existing merging techniques proves challenging. To this end, we propose
FastVGGT, which, for the first time, leverages token merging in the 3D domain
through a training-free mechanism for accelerating VGGT. we devise a unique
token partitioning strategy tailored to 3D architectures and tasks, effectively
eliminating redundant computation while preserving VGGT's powerful
reconstruction capacity. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D geometry
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, with 1000 input
images, FastVGGT achieves a 4x speedup over VGGT while mitigating error
accumulation in long-sequence scenarios. These findings underscore the
potential of token merging as a principled solution for scalable 3D vision
systems. Code is available at: https://mystorm16.github.io/fastvggt/.

*Marshall Thomas,Edward Fish,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多流模块化简化正文翻译框架MultiStream-LLM，通过专业化的指书法、连续手语和唉读预测器，结合LLM实现了简化正文翻译的新SOTA成果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的结构化简化正文翻译模型在高速指书法识别和非手势线索整合方面表现差强，导致名字、地址等关键信息翻译出错

Method: 采用模块化设计，使用三个专业预测器分别处理连续手语、指书法和唉读，通过轻量转换器解决时间对齐问题，最终由大语言模型生成句子

Result: 在How2Sign赛道上达到BLEU-4分数23.5的新SOTA，在ChicagoFSWildPlus指书法数据集上获得73.2%的字母准确率

Conclusion: 通过将不同识别任务隔离并单独解决，多专家方法为稳健、高保真的简化正文翻译提供了更有效的途径

Abstract: Despite progress in gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT), monolithic
end-to-end models consistently fail on two critical components of natural
signing: the precise recognition of high-speed fingerspelling and the
integration of asynchronous non-manual cues from the face. Recent progress in
Automated Sign Language Translation with Large Language Models has side stepped
this challenge, forcing a single network to learn these simultaneously
resulting in poor performance when tasked with translating crucial information
such as names,places, and technical terms. We introduce MultiStream-LLM, a
modular framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach employs
separate, specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and
lipreading. Each expert network first decodes its specific modality into a
sequence of tokens. These parallel streams are then fused by a lightweight
transformer that resolves temporal misalignments before passing the combined
representation to a Large Language Model (LLM) for final sentence generation.
Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the How2Sign benchmark with a
BLEU-4 score of 23.5 and achieves 73.2% letter accuracy on the challenging
ChicagoFSWildPlus fingerspelling dataset. These results validate our core
hypothesis: by isolating and solving distinct recogni tion tasks before fusion,
our multi-expert approach provides a more powerful and effective pathway to
robust, high-fidelity sign language translation.

Conclusion: 这是声明式提示优化方法在SLR流程中的新颖应用，为构建更可靠、可复现的LLM辅助科学研究提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential to accelerate
systematic literature reviews (SLRs), yet current approaches often rely on
brittle, manually crafted prompts that compromise reliability and
reproducibility. This fragility undermines scientific confidence in
LLM-assisted evidence synthesis. In response, this work adapts recent advances
in declarative prompt optimisation, developed for general-purpose LLM
applications, and demonstrates their applicability to the domain of SLR
automation. This research proposes a structured, domain-specific framework that
embeds task declarations, test suites, and automated prompt tuning into a
reproducible SLR workflow. These emerging methods are translated into a
concrete blueprint with working code examples, enabling researchers to
construct verifiable LLM pipelines that align with established principles of
transparency and rigour in evidence synthesis. This is a novel application of
such approaches to SLR pipelines.

Abstract: Over the past decades, alongside advancements in natural language processing,
significant attention has been paid to training models to automatically
extract, understand, test, and generate hypotheses in open and scientific
domains. However, interpretations of the term \emph{hypothesis} for various
natural language understanding (NLU) tasks have migrated from traditional
definitions in the natural, social, and formal sciences. Even within NLU, we
observe differences defining hypotheses across literature. In this paper, we
overview and delineate various definitions of hypothesis. Especially, we
discern the nuances of definitions across recently published NLU tasks. We
highlight the importance of well-structured and well-defined hypotheses,
particularly as we move toward a machine-interpretable scholarly record.

Conclusion: 提出的状态感知转换框架有效提升了思维链推理的可解释性，为理解复杂推理过程提供了新的结构化分析方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have enabled large
language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step reasoning. However, the
explainability of such reasoning remains limited, with prior work primarily
focusing on local token-level attribution, such that the high-level semantic
roles of reasoning steps and their transitions remain underexplored. In this
paper, we introduce a state-aware transition framework that abstracts CoT
trajectories into structured latent dynamics. Specifically, to capture the
evolving semantics of CoT reasoning, each reasoning step is represented via
spectral analysis of token-level embeddings and clustered into semantically
coherent latent states. To characterize the global structure of reasoning, we
model their progression as a Markov chain, yielding a structured and
interpretable view of the reasoning process. This abstraction supports a range
of analyses, including semantic role identification, temporal pattern
visualization, and consistency evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM)新任务和DiFBench基准框架，评估LLM在文档集合中识别全局稀有特征的能力，发现现有模型在统计推理和稀有性检测方面存在显著局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注信息检索和摘要，但缺乏评估模型识别全局稀有特征的能力，这在候选选择、产品差异化等现实场景中至关重要。

Method: 引入DFM任务，要求模型分析10-40个文档集合并识别出现频率低于10%的稀有特征；开发DiFBench可配置基准框架，控制文档集大小和独特性阈值等参数。

Result: 对10个最先进LLM的大规模评估显示：通用模型与推理增强模型之间存在显著性能差距；所有模型在任务复杂度和文档数量增加时性能大幅下降；常见错误是将频繁特征误认为稀有特征。

Conclusion: 当代LLM在执行细粒度统计推理和稀有性检测方面存在核心局限性，需要开发更强大的推理能力来应对这类现实世界任务。

Abstract: Effective decision-making often relies on identifying what makes each
candidate distinctive. While existing benchmarks for LLMs emphasize retrieving
or summarizing information relevant to a given query, they do not evaluate a
model's ability to identify globally distinctive features across a set of
documents. We introduce Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM), a new task that
challenges models to analyze a small-to-medium collection (10-40 documents) and
surface features that are rare in the global context (e.g., appearing in less
than 10% of documents). This setting mirrors real-world scenarios such as
candidate selection or product differentiation, where statistical reasoning,
not retrieval, is key. To enable systematic evaluation of this capability, we
present DiFBench, a configurable benchmark creation framework with controllable
parameters such as document set size and distinctiveness thresholds. Using
DiFBench, we perform a large-scale assessment of distinctive feature mining
across ten state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal a significant performance
gap between general-purpose and reasoning-enhanced models. All models, however,
substantially degrade as the task complexity and document count increase. We
also find that a common failure mode is misidentifying frequent features as
distinctive. These insights reveal core limitations in contemporary LLMs'
abilities to perform fine-grained, statistical reasoning and rarity detection.

Motivation: 当前人类意义建构建模方法缺乏一个通用的理论框架来统一描述各种模型类型，无法在不同模型间进行公平比较。

Method: 基于C.S. Peirce的符号学理论构建理论框架，将模型视为测量潜在符号几何的假设，并通过模型间的关系对比来理解模型语义。

Result: 提出了一个能够统一描述各种建模实践的理论框架，并通过简要实例展示了该框架的实证应用。

Conclusion: 该框架为建模实践提供了理论基础，使模型本身及其建模决策能够被视为符号来处理，为未来研究开辟了新的方向。

Abstract: The proliferation of methods for modeling of human meaning-making constitutes
a powerful class of instruments for the analysis of complex semiotic systems.
However, the field lacks a general theoretical framework for describing these
modeling practices across various model types in an apples-to-apples way. In
this paper, we propose such a framework grounded in the semiotic theory of C.
S. Peirce. We argue that such models measure latent symbol geometries, which
can be understood as hypotheses about the complex of semiotic agencies
underlying a symbolic dataset. Further, we argue that in contexts where a
model's value cannot be straightforwardly captured by proxy measures of
performance, models can instead be understood relationally, so that the
particular interpretive lens of a model becomes visible through its contrast
with other models. This forms the basis of a theory of model semantics in which
models, and the modeling decisions that constitute them, are themselves treated
as signs. In addition to proposing the framework, we illustrate its empirical
use with a few brief examples and consider foundational questions and future
directions enabled by the framework.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Temporal Game是一种新颖的时间关系提取方法，将标注任务转化为交互式游戏，通过点对点比较来分解区间级关系，支持强化学习代理训练，并提供游戏模式和标注模式两种功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的时间关系标注方法直接处理区间级关系存在局限性，需要更细粒度和灵活的方法来同时支持区间和瞬时实体的标注，并为强化学习提供训练基础。

Method: 将时间关系提取任务分解为起点和终点之间的点对点比较，玩家逐步分类单个点关系，系统应用时间闭包推理额外关系并确保一致性。

Result: 开发了包含游戏模式和标注模式的演示系统，用户可以在TempEval-3数据集上标注文本并获得评分反馈，也可以标注自定义文档并导出时间线。

Conclusion: Temporal Game不仅作为研究工具和标注界面，还为时间推理和标注领域的进一步研究和社区驱动发展提供了开放平台。

Abstract: In this paper we demo the Temporal Game, a novel approach to temporal
relation extraction that casts the task as an interactive game. Instead of
directly annotating interval-level relations, our approach decomposes them into
point-wise comparisons between the start and end points of temporal entities.
At each step, players classify a single point relation, and the system applies
temporal closure to infer additional relations and enforce consistency. This
point-based strategy naturally supports both interval and instant entities,
enabling more fine-grained and flexible annotation than any previous approach.
The Temporal Game also lays the groundwork for training reinforcement learning
agents, by treating temporal annotation as a sequential decision-making task.
To showcase this potential, the demo presented in this paper includes a Game
mode, in which users annotate texts from the TempEval-3 dataset and receive
feedback based on a scoring system, and an Annotation mode, that allows custom
documents to be annotated and resulting timeline to be exported. Therefore,
this demo serves both as a research tool and an annotation interface. The demo
is publicly available at https://temporal-game.inesctec.pt, and the source code
is open-sourced to foster further research and community-driven development in
temporal reasoning and annotation.

TL;DR: RITE方法通过生成中间推理文本来增强文本嵌入，将逻辑推理融入LLM的嵌入过程，在推理密集型检索任务中显著提升零样本检索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的嵌入方法主要关注上下文表示，未能充分利用LLMs的强大推理能力。复杂现实查询需要超越表层词汇匹配的深度推理来检索相关文档，而仅编码器检索器在这方面存在不足

Method: 提出RITE（Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding）方法，在计算嵌入之前先在token空间中生成中间推理文本，从而用推理深度丰富表示。该方法建立在现有语言模型嵌入技术基础上

Result: 在推理密集型检索基准BRIGHT上的实验结果表明，RITE显著提升了跨多个领域的零样本检索性能

Conclusion: 将推理融入嵌入过程是有效的，RITE方法通过利用LLMs的推理能力来增强文本嵌入质量

Abstract: Transformer-based models such as BERT and E5 have significantly advanced text
embedding by capturing rich contextual representations. However, many complex
real-world queries require sophisticated reasoning to retrieve relevant
documents beyond surface-level lexical matching, where encoder-only retrievers
often fall short. Decoder-only large language models (LLMs), known for their
strong reasoning capabilities, offer a promising alternative. Despite this
potential, existing LLM-based embedding methods primarily focus on contextual
representation and do not fully exploit the reasoning strength of LLMs. To
bridge this gap, we propose Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding (RITE), a simple
but effective approach that integrates logical reasoning into the text
embedding process using generative LLMs. RITE builds upon existing language
model embedding techniques by generating intermediate reasoning texts in the
token space before computing embeddings, thereby enriching representations with
inferential depth. Experimental results on BRIGHT, a reasoning-intensive
retrieval benchmark, demonstrate that RITE significantly enhances zero-shot
retrieval performance across diverse domains, underscoring the effectiveness of
incorporating reasoning into the embedding process.

Abstract: We study the problem of opinion highlights generation from large volumes of

either fail to scale or produce generic, one-size-fits-all summaries that
overlook personalized needs. To tackle this, we introduce OpinioRAG, a
scalable, training-free framework that combines RAG-based evidence retrieval
with LLMs to efficiently produce tailored summaries. Additionally, we propose
novel reference-free verification metrics designed for sentiment-rich domains,
where accurately capturing opinions and sentiment alignment is essential. These
metrics offer a fine-grained, context-sensitive assessment of factual
consistency. To facilitate evaluation, we contribute the first large-scale
dataset of long-form user reviews, comprising entities with over a thousand

queries. Through extensive experiments, we identify key challenges, provide
actionable insights into improving systems, pave the way for future research,
and position OpinioRAG as a robust framework for generating accurate, relevant,

Abstract: The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created new
opportunities for economic text analysis. This study proposes a Wage Sentiment
Index (WSI) constructed with Large Language Models (LLMs) to forecast wage
dynamics in Japan. The analysis is based on the Economy Watchers Survey (EWS),
a monthly survey conducted by the Cabinet Office of Japan that captures
real-time economic assessments from workers in industries highly sensitive to
business conditions. The WSI extends the framework of the Price Sentiment Index
(PSI) used in prior studies, adapting it specifically to wage related
sentiment. To ensure scalability and adaptability, a data architecture is also
developed that enables integration of additional sources such as newspapers and
social media. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI models based on LLMs
significantly outperform both baseline approaches and pretrained models. These
findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven sentiment indices to enhance the
timeliness and effectiveness of economic policy design by governments and
central banks.

Motivation: 研究RLHF应用于蒸馏训练模型时出现的训练不稳定问题，包括序列长度崩溃和奖励异常现象，这些现象损害模型的对齐和推理能力

Method: 提出平衡演员初始化(BAI)方法，采用两阶段加权模型合并：先合并指令跟随和蒸馏推理微调模型，再与预训练模型合并以保留基础知识

Result: BAI成功解决了序列长度崩溃问题，缓解了奖励曲棍球棒曲线现象，实现了训练期间序列长度的持续改进，并在多个基准测试中验证了有效性

Conclusion: BAI为第三范式提供了有效的稳定训练解决方案，使模型能够结合蒸馏效率和RLHF对齐，产生更具能力的推理模型

Abstract: The development of alignment and reasoning capabilities in large language
models has seen remarkable progress through two paradigms: instruction tuning
and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment paradigm, and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuning paradigm. While both approaches prove
effective independently, the third paradigm of applying RLHF to
distillation-trained models presents significant challenges. Our investigation
reveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length
Collapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF
training, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score
drops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally
compromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage
weighted model merging approach. BAI first merges instruction-following and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuned models, then further combines this
intermediate model with the pretrained model to preserve foundational
knowledge. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and
detailed analysis of training experiments, we demonstrate that BAI resolves
Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables
continuous sequence length improvement during training. Additionally, our
analysis reveals that balanced merging ratios achieve optimal trade-offs
between training stability and reasoning capability preservation. Our work
provides the effective solution for stable training in this third paradigm,
enabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency
with RLHF alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示策略依赖演示、示例或思维链模板，需要开发GIER这种不依赖这些元素的方法来提升模型输出的推理质量、基础和一致性。

Method: GIER使用自然语言描述推理差距，提示模型迭代地批判和精炼自身输出，通过自我反思和修订来满足概念质量标准。

Result: 在三个推理密集型任务和四个大语言模型上，GIER提高了理由质量、基础性和推理一致性，且不降低任务准确性。

Conclusion: 模型不仅能解释抽象概念差距，还能将其转化为具体的推理改进，证明GIER框架的有效性和通用性。

Abstract: We introduce GIER (Gap-driven Iterative Enhancement of Responses), a general
framework for improving large language model (LLM) outputs through
self-reflection and revision based on conceptual quality criteria. Unlike
prompting strategies that rely on demonstrations, examples, or chain-of-thought
templates, GIER utilizes natural language descriptions of reasoning gaps, and
prompts a model to iteratively critique and refine its own outputs to better
satisfy these criteria. Across three reasoning-intensive tasks (SciFact,
PrivacyQA, and e-SNLI) and four LLMs (GPT-4.1, GPT-4o Mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and
Llama 3.3 70B), GIER improves rationale quality, grounding, and reasoning
alignment without degrading task accuracy. Our analysis demonstrates that
models can not only interpret abstract conceptual gaps but also translate them
into concrete reasoning improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法捕捉深度研究任务的复杂性，而合成数据集存在推理捷径、知识泄露或结构深度不足的问题，需要新的框架来支持复杂的层次约束满足问题。

Method: 使用双代理系统递归地从大规模网页构建研究树，将中间节点模糊化为有效子问题，并将这些树转换为需要遍历完整层次结构的自然语言问题。

Result: 在InfoSeek上训练的模型始终优于强基线，3B LLM在BrowseComp-Plus基准上超越32B模型和轻量级商业API，性能与更强的API相当。

Conclusion: InfoSeek提供了一个可扩展的框架来合成复杂的深度研究任务，支持高级优化策略，并为LLM的深度研究能力提供了有效的训练数据。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to go beyond simple
factual queries toward Deep Research-tasks that require decomposing questions
into sub-problems, coordinating multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence
from diverse sources. We formalize Deep Research tasks with verifiable answers
as Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (HCSPs), which are
fundamentally different from single-constraint, multi-hop, or flat CSP
formulations. However, existing benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA)
fail to capture this complexity, while recent synthetic datasets often
introduce shortcut reasoning, knowledge leakage, or lack sufficient structural
depth. To address this gap, we introduce InfoSeek, a scalable framework for
synthesizing complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to
recursively build a Research Tree from large-scale webpages, blurring
intermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into
natural language questions that require traversing the full hierarchy. It also
enables rapid scaling, yielding over 50K training examples, a curated test set,
and reasoning trajectories generated via reject sampling. Experiments show that
models trained on InfoSeek consistently outperform strong baselines. On a
challenging benchmark BrowseComp-Plus, 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass

### [227] [GraphKV: Breaking the Static Selection Paradigm with Graph-Based KV Cache Eviction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00388)
*Xuelin Li,Xiangqi Jin,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraphKV是一个基于图的KV缓存管理框架，通过动态传播机制自适应选择重要token，可无缝集成到现有方法中


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KV缓存淘汰策略基于静态启发式方法，无法捕捉推理过程中token间动态的隐式依赖关系，导致长文本处理性能受限

Method: 将token建模为带重要性分数的节点，边表示相似关系，通过衰减信号传播机制在图上动态更新token重要性，自适应保留上下文关键token

Result: 提出了可插拔的图基础框架，能够与SnapKV、PyramidKV等现有KV缓存淘汰方法无缝集成

Conclusion: GraphKV通过动态图传播机制有效解决了传统静态KV缓存管理方法的局限性，为长文本处理提供了更高效的解决方案

Abstract: Efficient Key-Value (KV) cache management is essential for processing long
text sequences in large language models (LLMs), where memory constraints often
limit performance. Conventional KV eviction strategies, such as top-k selection
based on attention scores, depend on static heuristics that fail to capture the
evolving implicit dependencies among tokens during inference. To overcome this,
we propose GraphKV, a graph-based framework that redefines token selection for
KV cache compression. In GraphKV, tokens are modeled as nodes with importance
scores, and edges represent their similarity relationships. Through a
decay-signal-propagation mechanism, token importance is dynamically updated by
propagating information across the graph, enabling adaptive retention of the
most contextually significant tokens. GraphKV can be seamlessly utilized in
existing KV cache eviction methods such as SnapKV and PyramidKV in a
plug-and-play manner. Codes will be released on Github.

*Yuting Tan,Xuying Li,Zhuo Li,Huizhen Shu,Peikang Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了GCG和T-GCG对抗性提示攻击在不同规模开源LLM上的效果，发现攻击成功率随模型增大而降低，语义评估比前缀启发式更严格，且推理相关提示比安全提示更易受攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估基于梯度的对抗性提示攻击（如GCG算法）在不同规模语言模型上的有效性，特别是在安全导向和推理密集型编码提示上的表现。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-0.5B、LLaMA-3.2-1B和GPT-OSS-20B模型，在AdvBench安全提示和推理密集型编码提示上评估GCG及其退火增强变体T-GCG的攻击效果，采用前缀启发式和GPT-4o语义判断两种评估方式。

Result: 1) 攻击成功率随模型规模增大而降低；2) 前缀启发式评估高估攻击效果，语义评估更严格现实；3) 编码相关提示比安全提示更易受攻击；T-GCG在退火搜索下能实现竞争性攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了GCG的可扩展性限制，暴露了推理任务中被忽视的脆弱性，并推动开发退火启发策略以进行更鲁棒的对抗性评估。

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial prompting, such as the Greedy Coordinate Gradient
(GCG) algorithm, has emerged as a powerful method for jailbreaking large
language models (LLMs). In this paper, we present a systematic appraisal of GCG
and its annealing-augmented variant, T-GCG, across open-source LLMs of varying
scales. Using Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, and GPT-OSS-20B, we evaluate attack
effectiveness on both safety-oriented prompts (AdvBench) and
reasoning-intensive coding prompts. Our study reveals three key findings: (1)
attack success rates (ASR) decrease with model size, reflecting the increasing
complexity and non-convexity of larger models' loss landscapes; (2)
prefix-based heuristics substantially overestimate attack effectiveness
compared to GPT-4o semantic judgments, which provide a stricter and more
realistic evaluation; and (3) coding-related prompts are significantly more
vulnerable than adversarial safety prompts, suggesting that reasoning itself
can be exploited as an attack vector. In addition, preliminary results with
T-GCG show that simulated annealing can diversify adversarial search and
achieve competitive ASR under prefix evaluation, though its benefits under
semantic judgment remain limited. Together, these findings highlight the
scalability limits of GCG, expose overlooked vulnerabilities in reasoning
tasks, and motivate further development of annealing-inspired strategies for
more robust adversarial evaluation.

TL;DR: MedSEBA是一个基于AI的医疗问答系统，利用大语言模型生成答案，并通过PubMed数据库动态检索可信医学研究来支撑回答，提供研究支持度可视化和时间演变分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决互联网医疗信息可靠性难以辨别的问题，以及医学研究数量庞大且结论可能相互矛盾，传统搜索工具无法反映研究共识演变的问题。

Method: 结合大语言模型生成连贯表达的回答，同时从PubMed数据库动态检索可信医学研究作为依据，提供关键论点溯源、研究支持度分析和研究共识时间演变可视化。

Result: 用户研究表明，医学专家和普通用户都认为系统可用且有帮助，提供的答案可信且信息丰富。

Conclusion: 该系统既适用于日常健康问题查询，也适合高级研究洞察，能有效帮助用户获取基于证据的医疗答案。

Abstract: In the digital age, people often turn to the Internet in search of medical
advice and recommendations. With the increasing volume of online content, it
has become difficult to distinguish reliable sources from misleading
information. Similarly, millions of medical studies are published every year,
making it challenging for researchers to keep track of the latest scientific
findings. These evolving studies can reach differing conclusions, which is not
reflected in traditional search tools. To address these challenges, we
introduce MedSEBA, an interactive AI-powered system for synthesizing
evidence-based answers to medical questions. It utilizes the power of Large
Language Models to generate coherent and expressive answers, but grounds them
in trustworthy medical studies dynamically retrieved from the research database
PubMed. The answers consist of key points and arguments, which can be traced
back to respective studies. Notably, the platform also provides an overview of
the extent to which the most relevant studies support or refute the given
medical claim, and a visualization of how the research consensus evolved
through time. Our user study revealed that medical experts and lay users find
the system usable and helpful, and the provided answers trustworthy and
informative. This makes the system well-suited for both everyday health
questions and advanced research insights.

*Fenghua Liu,Yulong Chen,Yixuan Liu,Zhujun Jin,Solomon Tsai,Ming Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Camlang是一个新颖的构造语言测试，用于评估LLM是否真正具备元语言推理能力，而非仅仅是模式匹配。GPT-5在英语CommonsenseQA上达到98%准确率，但在Camlang版本上只有47%，远低于人类的87%表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在测试大型语言模型是否真正具备人类般的元语言推理能力，还是仅仅进行模式匹配。通过构造具有自然但未见过的特征组合的新语言Camlang，来区分模型在形态句法、词汇语义和句子级推理方面的能力。

Method: 创建Camlang构造语言，包含语法书和双语词典资源，模拟成人第二语言学习。将CommonsenseQA适配为Camlang-CSQA-v0任务，要求应用语法规则和词汇映射来解决问题。通过人类实验验证资源有效性，并测试多个最先进推理LLM的表现。

Result: 人类参与者能够成功掌握Camlang并解决任务（87%准确率），而GPT-5在英语任务上达到98%但在Camlang上只有47%。其他先进LLM表现更差。人类验证显示大多数模型成功来自浅层词汇对齐，GPT-5显示出有限的元语言意识但未达到人类系统性的语法掌握水平。

Conclusion: Camlang建立了一个认知基础的评估范式，揭示了当前模型与人类元语言能力之间的根本差距，表明LLM在真正的元语言推理方面仍存在重大局限。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve gold-medal performance across many
benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects genuine
reasoning or pattern matching. From a cognitive science perspective, an
informative test is whether models can master an unfamiliar language through
explicit metalinguistic deductive learning, a paradigm where human learners can
reliably internalise grammatical systems through metalinguistic reasoning. We
address this question with Camlang, a novel constructed language that exhibits
naturalistic yet unattested feature combinations. Camlang consists of two
explicit resources, a grammar book and a bilingual dictionary, which mirror
adult second-language learning via explicit grammar rules and lexical lookup,
and enable us to disentangle errors in morpho-syntax, lexical semantics, and
sentence-level reasoning. Human experiments show that these resources are
sufficient for participants to acquire Camlang and successfully solve Camlang
tasks. To operationalise evaluation, we adapt CommonsenseQA into Camlang,
creating Camlang-CSQA-v0, the first task in a broader suite where solving
questions requires applying grammar rules and lexical mappings. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 achieves 98\% EM accuracy in English but only 47\% in
Camlang, far below human performance at 87\%, while other state-of-the-art
reasoning LLMs perform even worse. Human verification further reveals that most
model successes stem from shallow lexical alignment while GPT-5 shows emerging
metalinguistic awareness to a limited extent but not systematic grammatical
mastery as humans. Camlang establishes a cognitively grounded evaluation
paradigm that exposes fundamental gaps between current models and human
metalinguistic competence.

*Xuecheng Zou,Ke Liu,Bingbing Wang,Huafei Deng,Li Zhang,Yu Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GOSU是一个基于语义单元的RAG框架，通过全局消歧和语义单元融合来解决传统图RAG中局部语义单元提取的模糊性和复杂耦合问题，在多个任务上优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的RAG方法使用异构图和超图来丰富检索和生成，但局部文本块中提取的高层语义单元容易产生歧义、复杂耦合，并因缺乏全局知识或忽略细粒度关系而增加检索开销。

Method: 提出GOSU框架：1）图构建阶段对局部文本块预提取的语义单元进行全局融合，指导实体和关系提取；2）检索生成阶段引入分层关键词提取和语义单元补全，分别捕获细粒度二元关系和粗粒度n元关系。

Result: 在多个任务上的评估表明，GOSU在生成质量方面优于基线RAG方法。

Conclusion: GOSU通过全局语义单元处理和分层关系捕获机制，有效解决了传统RAG方法的局限性，提升了检索增强生成的性能。

Abstract: Building upon the standard graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
the introduction of heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs aims to enrich
retrieval and generation by leveraging the relationships between multiple
entities through the concept of semantic units (SUs). But this also raises a
key issue: The extraction of high-level SUs limited to local text chunks is
prone to ambiguity, complex coupling, and increased retrieval overhead due to
the lack of global knowledge or the neglect of fine-grained relationships. To
address these issues, we propose GOSU, a semantic unit-centric RAG framework
that efficiently performs global disambiguation and utilizes SUs to capture
interconnections between different nodes across the global context. In the
graph construction phase, GOSU performs global merging on the pre-extracted SUs
from local text chunks and guides entity and relationship extraction, reducing
the difficulty of coreference resolution while uncovering global semantic
objects across text chunks. In the retrieval and generation phase, we introduce
hierarchical keyword extraction and semantic unit completion. The former
uncovers the fine-grained binary relationships overlooked by the latter, while
the latter compensates for the coarse-grained n-ary relationships missing from
the former. Evaluation across multiple tasks demonstrates that GOSU outperforms
the baseline RAG methods in terms of generation quality.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级框架，使用专门的阿拉伯文本编码器和注意力相关性评分来解决伊斯兰继承法的多选题问题，在保证效率和隐私的前提下达到69.87%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伊斯兰继承法需要精确识别继承人和计算份额，这对AI构成挑战。需要一种能够进行快速、设备本地推理且保证隐私的解决方案。

Method: 使用专门的阿拉伯文本编码器（MARBERT、ArabicBERT、AraBERT）组合注意力相关性评分（ARS）技术，对答案选项进行语义相关性排名，避免生成式推理，实现轻量化的设备本地推理。

Result: 在QIAS 2025数据集上，大型模型（Gemini、DeepSeek）达到最87.6%的最高准确率，而使用MARBERT的方法获得69.87%的准确率。虽然性能略低，但具有更高的效率、设备本地部署能力和隐私保护优势。

Conclusion: 这项工作量化了大型模型的极致性能与小型专门系统实用优势之间的关键变换关系，为高风险领域提供了一种在效率、部署性和隐私保护方面更具实用价值的解决方案。

Abstract: Islamic inheritance law (Ilm al-Mawarith) requires precise identification of
heirs and calculation of shares, which poses a challenge for AI. In this paper,
we present a lightweight framework for solving multiple-choice inheritance
questions using a specialised Arabic text encoder and Attentive Relevance
Scoring (ARS). The system ranks answer options according to semantic relevance,
and enables fast, on-device inference without generative reasoning. We evaluate
Arabic encoders (MARBERT, ArabicBERT, AraBERT) and compare them with API-based
LLMs (Gemini, DeepSeek) on the QIAS 2025 dataset. While large models achieve an
accuracy of up to 87.6%, they require more resources and are context-dependent.
Our MARBERT-based approach achieves 69.87% accuracy, presenting a compelling
case for efficiency, on-device deployability, and privacy. While this is lower
than the 87.6% achieved by the best-performing LLM, our work quantifies a
critical trade-off between the peak performance of large models and the
practical advantages of smaller, specialized systems in high-stakes domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放域语言生成的不确定性量化在无法访问内部模型信号的黑盒约束下是一个关键但未被充分探索的挑战。

Method: 使用token-level熵作为不确定性度量，将其整合到split conformal prediction流程中，通过CP分位数校准不确定性阈值来确保可证明的错误控制。

Result: 在6个大语言模型和2个基准测试(CoQA和TriviaQA)上的实验表明，TECP持续实现可靠覆盖和紧凑预测集，优于先前的自一致性UQ方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为黑盒LLM设置中的可信生成提供了一个原则性和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for open-ended language generation remains a
critical yet underexplored challenge, especially under black-box constraints
where internal model signals are inaccessible. In this paper, we introduce
Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP), a novel framework that leverages
token-level entropy as a logit-free, reference-free uncertainty measure and
integrates it into a split conformal prediction (CP) pipeline to construct
prediction sets with formal coverage guarantees. Unlike existing approaches
that rely on semantic consistency heuristics or white-box features, TECP
directly estimates epistemic uncertainty from the token entropy structure of
sampled generations and calibrates uncertainty thresholds via CP quantiles to
ensure provable error control. Empirical evaluations across six large language
models and two benchmarks (CoQA and TriviaQA) demonstrate that TECP
consistently achieves reliable coverage and compact prediction sets,
outperforming prior self-consistency-based UQ methods. Our method provides a
principled and efficient solution for trustworthy generation in black-box LLM
settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探索了四种提示方法来解决角色扮演对话代理中的过度说话和工具使用不足问题，其中基于规则的提示方法(RRP)通过角色卡/场景契约设计和严格函数调用执行获得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在CPDC 2025挑战中，对话代理经常产生过长的角色回应(过度说话)，同时未能根据角色有效使用工具(行动不足)，如生成不存在的函数调用或在回答前进行不必要的工具调用。

Method: 研究了四种提示方法：1)基础角色提示 2)人工制作角色提示 3)自动提示优化(APO) 4)基于规则的角色提示(RRP)，其中RRP采用了角色卡/场景契约设计和严格函数调用执行技术。

Result: 基于规则的角色提示(RRP)方法获得了0.571的总分，相比零样本基线的0.519有显著提升，表现优于更复杂的APO方法。

Conclusion: RRP设计可以显著提高角色扮演对话代理的有效性和可靠性，研究开源了最佳提示和APO工具以支持未来研究。

Abstract: This report investigates approaches for prompting a tool-augmented large
language model (LLM) to act as a role-playing dialogue agent in the API track
of the Commonsense Persona-grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025. In this
setting, dialogue agents often produce overly long in-character responses
(over-speaking) while failing to use tools effectively according to the persona
(under-acting), such as generating function calls that do not exist or making
unnecessary tool calls before answering. We explore four prompting approaches
to address these issues: 1) basic role prompting, 2) human-crafted role
prompting, 3) automatic prompt optimization (APO), and 4) rule-based role
prompting. The rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieved the best
performance through two novel techniques--character-card/scene-contract design
and strict enforcement of function calling--which led to an overall score of
0.571, improving on the zero-shot baseline score of 0.519. These findings
demonstrate that RRP design can substantially improve the effectiveness and
reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared with more elaborate
methods such as APO. To support future efforts in developing persona prompts,
we are open-sourcing all of our best-performing prompts and the APO tool.

TL;DR: ResearchQA是一个从75个研究领域的综述文章中提取21K查询和160K评分标准的资源，用于评估LLM系统在回答研究问题时的表现。通过专家评估显示96%的查询支持博士信息需求，87%的评分标准需要在系统回答中体现。自动评估系统与专家判断达到74%的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估研究查询的长篇回答主要依赖专家标注，限制了评估范围。研究专业知识广泛分布在文献中，特别是综述文章汇总了分散的知识。需要一种方法来更全面地评估LLM系统在研究领域的表现。

Method: 从75个研究领域的综述文章中提取21K个查询和160K个评分标准项目。每个评分标准包含查询特定的回答评估标准，如引用论文、解释说明和描述限制。使用31位博士标注者在8个领域进行评估。

Result: 96%的查询支持博士信息需求，87%的评分标准需要在系统回答中体现至少一个句子。自动成对评估系统与专家判断达到74%的一致性。在7.6K次成对评估中，没有参数化或检索增强系统超过70%的评分标准覆盖率，最高排名代理系统达到75%覆盖率。

Conclusion: ResearchQA提供了一个全面的多领域评估框架，揭示了当前LLM系统在研究回答中的能力差距，特别是在引用、限制描述和比较方面表现不足。该资源有助于推动更全面的多领域评估研究。

Abstract: Evaluating long-form responses to research queries heavily relies on expert
annotators, restricting attention to areas like AI where researchers can
conveniently enlist colleagues. Yet, research expertise is widespread: survey
articles synthesize knowledge distributed across the literature. We introduce
ResearchQA, a resource for evaluating LLM systems by distilling survey articles
from 75 research fields into 21K queries and 160K rubric items. Each rubric,
derived jointly with queries from survey sections, lists query-specific answer
evaluation criteria, i.e., citing papers, making explanations, and describing
limitations. Assessments by 31 Ph.D. annotators in 8 fields indicate 96% of
queries support Ph.D. information needs and 87% of rubric items should be
addressed in system responses by a sentence or more. Using our rubrics, we are
able to construct an automatic pairwise judge obtaining 74% agreement with
expert judgments. We leverage ResearchQA to analyze competency gaps in 18
systems in over 7.6K pairwise evaluations. No parametric or retrieval-augmented
system we evaluate exceeds 70% on covering rubric items, and the
highest-ranking agentic system shows 75% coverage. Error analysis reveals that
the highest-ranking system fully addresses less than 11% of citation rubric
items, 48% of limitation items, and 49% of comparison items. We release our
data to facilitate more comprehensive multi-field evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音离散表示学习方法的刻度过细（25-50到弥2次/秒），导致冗余和效率低下，而语义理解并不需要这么细层级的分辨率。

Method: 首先通过下一个刻度预测预训练语音语言模型，然后使用预测熵动态确定聚合边界，最后通过交叉注意力模块融合每个段落内的信息。

Result: 在ASR、语音到文本翻译和语音转换任务中，压缩后的表示与密集刻度序列表现相当或更好。

Conclusion: 该方法能够灵活控制表示的粒度和压缩比，在保持语义表达能力的同时显著提高效率。

Abstract: Discrete speech representation learning has recently attracted increasing
interest in both acoustic and semantic modeling. Existing approaches typically
encode 16 kHz waveforms into discrete tokens at a rate of 25 or 50 tokens per
second. However, given that speech generally conveys only 2 to 5 words per
second, such fine-grained tokenization introduces redundancy and hinders
efficiency in downstream training and inference. Moreover, semantic speech
representations at this frequency primarily capture phonetic-level information,
while semantic understanding may not require such detailed token-level
resolution. To address these limitations, we propose an entropy-based dynamic
aggregation framework for learning compressed semantic speech representations.
A speech language model is first pre-trained via next-token prediction on
large-scale unlabeled data to capture frequent token patterns. Predictive
entropy is then used to adaptively determine aggregation boundaries, followed
by a cross-attention module that fuses information within each segment. By
adjusting the entropy threshold, the granularity and compression ratio of the
representations can be flexibly controlled. Experiments on ASR, speech-to-text
translation, and voice conversion tasks demonstrate that the compressed
representations perform on par with or better than dense token sequences,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: LLMs在生成法律文件摘要时会根据用户的法律角色（法官、检察官、律师等）进行动机性推理，选择性包含信息以符合角色立场，即使有平衡指令也难以避免这种偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在法律语境中如何根据不同的法律角色进行动机性推理，即模型如何战略性地构建信息以符合利益相关者在法律体系中的立场。

Method: 基于法律现实主义和近期法律实践趋势，引入基于法律事实和推理包含度的评估框架，考虑对利益相关者的倾向性，分析LLMs在不同法律角色提示下的司法判决摘要行为。

Result: 结果显示即使提示中包含平衡指令，模型仍表现出选择性包含模式，反映出与角色一致的视角。当LLMs开始从先前交互或上下文中推断用户角色时，即使没有明确的角色指令，类似的对其现象也会出现。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在高风险法律环境中需要对LLM摘要行为进行角色感知评估的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate user-tailored
summaries, adapting outputs to specific stakeholders. In legal contexts, this
raises important questions about motivated reasoning -- how models
strategically frame information to align with a stakeholder's position within
the legal system. Building on theories of legal realism and recent trends in
legal practice, we investigate how LLMs respond to prompts conditioned on
different legal roles (e.g., judges, prosecutors, attorneys) when summarizing
judicial decisions. We introduce an evaluation framework grounded in legal fact
and reasoning inclusion, also considering favorability towards stakeholders.
Our results show that even when prompts include balancing instructions, models
exhibit selective inclusion patterns that reflect role-consistent perspectives.
These findings raise broader concerns about how similar alignment may emerge as
LLMs begin to infer user roles from prior interactions or context, even without
explicit role instructions. Our results underscore the need for role-aware
evaluation of LLM summarization behavior in high-stakes legal settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型广泛应用，其安全性和与人类价值观对齐的问题日益突出。先前研究表明在恶意数据集上微调会导致模型行为失准，但本文发现即使使用良性数据增强推理能力也会引发新的对齐问题

Method: 通过切换"思考模式"或在良性数学数据集上微调来增强模型推理能力，分析模型内部状态（注意力机制和混合专家模型中的专家分工）

Result: 推理能力增强使模型更易响应恶意请求，密集模型尤其脆弱；注意力转移和专家机制有助于将过度推理导向安全防护

Conclusion: 揭示了新兴的推理-安全权衡问题，强调了为高级推理模型推进对齐技术的紧迫性，为理解模型安全机制提供了新视角

Abstract: With Large Language Models (LLMs) becoming increasingly widely adopted,
concerns regarding their safety and alignment with human values have
intensified. Previous studies have shown that fine-tuning LLMs on narrow and
malicious datasets induce misaligned behaviors. In this work, we report a more
concerning phenomenon, Reasoning-Induced Misalignment. Specifically, we observe
that LLMs become more responsive to malicious requests when reasoning is
strengthened, via switching to "think-mode" or fine-tuning on benign math
datasets, with dense models particularly vulnerable. Moreover, we analyze
internal model states and find that both attention shifts and specialized
experts in mixture-of-experts models help redirect excessive reasoning towards
safety guardrails. These findings provide new insights into the emerging
reasoning-safety trade-off and underscore the urgency of advancing alignment
for advanced reasoning models.

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型在测试环境和部署环境中存在行为差异（评估意识现象），通过提示词重写技术可以使模型行为更接近真实部署环境，提高诚实回答率5.26%，降低欺骗性回答率12.40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在基准测试和实际部署环境中表现出显著的行为差异，这种评估意识现象对AI对齐构成严重挑战，因为基准性能可能无法准确反映模型真实的安全性和诚实性。

Method: 提出了一种系统量化方法：使用线性探针对提示词进行"测试类"到"部署类"的连续评分，并利用LLM重写策略将提示词转向更自然的部署风格上下文，同时保持原始任务不变。

Result: 在战略角色扮演数据集上，重写后平均探针分数提高了30%。所有模型在重写的"部署类"提示词下都表现出显著一致的行为转变：诚实回答平均增加5.26%，欺骗性回答平均减少12.40%，拒绝率平均增加6.38%。

Conclusion: 评估意识是一个可量化和可操纵的因素，直接影响LLM行为。模型在感知的测试环境中更容易产生不安全或欺骗性输出，这强调了需要更现实的评估框架来准确衡量模型对齐程度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit significant behavioral shifts when
they perceive a change from a real-world deployment context to a controlled
evaluation setting, a phenomenon known as "evaluation awareness." This
discrepancy poses a critical challenge for AI alignment, as benchmark
performance may not accurately reflect a model's true safety and honesty. In
this work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating
the perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear
probe to score prompts on a continuous scale from "test-like" to "deploy-like"
and leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more
natural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using
this method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a
strategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of
state-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that
rewritten "deploy-like" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in
behavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest
responses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses
of 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%,
indicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that
evaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly
influences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or
deceptive outputs in perceived test environments. This underscores the urgent
need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge true model
alignment before deployment.

*Rishiraj Acharya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出GAM网络，一种线性复杂度的并行架构，替代Transformer的自注意力机制，通过卷积和关联记忆机制结合局部与全局信息，在速度和性能上优于基线模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的自注意力机制存在二次计算复杂度问题，在处理长序列时成为显著瓶颈，需要更高效的序列建模架构

Method: GAM块用两条并行路径替代自注意力：因果卷积捕获局部上下文，关联记忆检索机制建模全局模式，通过门控机制动态融合

Result: 在WikiText-2和TinyStories数据集上，GAM训练速度更快，验证困惑度优于或持平Transformer和Mamba基线

Conclusion: GAM是序列建模的高效替代方案，具有线性复杂度，在保持竞争力的同时显著提升计算效率

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the self-attention mechanism,
has become the de facto standard for sequence modeling tasks. However, its core
computational primitive scales quadratically with sequence length (O(N^2)),
creating a significant bottleneck for processing long contexts. In this paper,
we propose the Gated Associative Memory (GAM) network, a novel, fully parallel
architecture for sequence modeling that exhibits linear complexity (O(N)) with
respect to sequence length. The GAM block replaces the self-attention layer
with two parallel pathways: a causal convolution to efficiently capture local,
position-dependent context, and a parallel associative memory retrieval
mechanism to model global, content-based patterns. These pathways are
dynamically fused using a gating mechanism, allowing the model to flexibly
combine local and global information for each token. We implement GAM from
scratch and conduct a rigorous comparative analysis against a standard
Transformer model and a modern linear-time baseline (Mamba) on the WikiText-2
benchmark, as well as against the Transformer on the TinyStories dataset. Our
experiments demonstrate that GAM is consistently faster, outperforming both
baselines on training speed, and achieves a superior or competitive final
validation perplexity across all datasets, establishing it as a promising and
efficient alternative for sequence modeling.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了ICPC基准测试，包含254个国际大学生程序设计竞赛题目，通过多轮自判断、反思和检索等技术，将语言模型的解题率从19.1%提升到42.2%，并发现特定指令能显著提升模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 竞争性编程问题需要复杂的算法思维和代码实现能力，但作为评估语言模型的领域尚未得到足够关注。研究旨在开发一个全面的基准来评估语言模型在竞争性编程任务中的表现。

Method: 构建包含254个ICPC题目的基准，每个问题包含官方分析、参考代码和多种测试用例。采用零样本思维链提示、多轮自判断与反思、信息检索等技术进行模型推理。

Result: 零样本思维链提示下模型仅达到19.1%的通过率，最佳推理技术组合将成功率提升至42.2%。人类参与的研究发现，特定指令能让模型解决之前无法解决的17/18个问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发具有扎实、创新和算法思维能力的语言模型提供了重要进展，开源了代码和数据以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Among the hardest tasks for humans are those found in competitive programming
where problems require sophisticated algorithmic thinking, puzzle solving, and
the creation of effective code. As a domain to assess language models (LMs), it
has not received enough attention, though. This study presents the ICPC
benchmark, which consists of 254 international collegiate programming contest
(ICPC) tasks. Each problem includes official analysis, reference code, and
sample, high-quality unit, and hidden tests. We are able to develop and
evaluate a variety of LM inference techniques for competitive programming with
these resources. With zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, we find that o1
only achieves a 19.1\% pass@1 solve rate. With our best inference technique,
which combines multi-turn self-judge with reflection and retrieval over
episodic information, raises this to 42.2\%. Furthermore, we conduct a new
human-in-the-loop investigation to gain a deeper understanding of the remaining
difficulties. Surprisingly, we discover that o1 can solve 17 out of 18 problems
that were previously unsolvable by any model or technique with just a few
specific instructions. A footstep toward LMs with grounded, imaginative, and
algorithmic thinking is provided by our quantitative findings and qualitative
research. We open-source our code and data at https://github.com/kraritt/zolve.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，经过安全对齐的审查模型在仇恨言论检测准确性和鲁棒性上显著优于未审查模型（78.7% vs 64.1%），但存在意识形态锚定效应，且所有模型在理解反讽等细微语言时都存在严重缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型在检测隐性和显性仇恨言论方面的效果，比较经过安全对齐（审查）和未对齐（未审查）模型在客观分类能力上的差异。

Method: 通过对比分析经过安全对齐和未安全对齐的大型语言模型，评估它们在仇恨言论检测任务中的准确性、鲁棒性、意识形态一致性以及对不同目标群体的公平性表现。

Result: 审查模型在准确性和鲁棒性上显著优于未审查模型，但存在强烈的意识形态锚定效应；未审查模型更容易受到意识形态框架的影响；所有模型在理解反讽等细微语言时都存在严重失败；存在明显的公平性差异和系统性过度自信问题。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了LLMs作为客观仲裁者的观念，强调需要开发更复杂的审计框架来考虑公平性、校准性和意识形态一致性。

Abstract: We investigate the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting
implicit and explicit hate speech, examining whether models with minimal safety
alignment (uncensored) might provide more objective classification capabilities
compared to their heavily-aligned (censored) counterparts. While uncensored
models theoretically offer a less constrained perspective free from moral
guardrails that could bias classification decisions, our results reveal a
surprising trade-off: censored models significantly outperform their uncensored
counterparts in both accuracy and robustness, achieving 78.7% versus 64.1%
strict accuracy. However, this enhanced performance comes with its own
limitation -- the safety alignment acts as a strong ideological anchor, making
censored models resistant to persona-based influence, while uncensored models
prove highly malleable to ideological framing. Furthermore, we identify
critical failures across all models in understanding nuanced language such as
irony. We also find alarming fairness disparities in performance across
different targeted groups and systemic overconfidence that renders
self-reported certainty unreliable. These findings challenge the notion of LLMs
as objective arbiters and highlight the need for more sophisticated auditing
frameworks that account for fairness, calibration, and ideological consistency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Router Upcycling方法，通过从注意力头初始化多个路由器来增强MoE上循环模型的性能，在复杂路由任务中实现SOTA表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型训练效率低，现有简单路由器在复杂路由任务中表现不佳，需要改进MoE上循环技术中的路由机制

Method: 在MoE上循环过程中，从前面的注意力层初始化多个路由器，以类似注意力的方式协作分配token给专家，每个token生成多样化查询并与专家特征（作为键）对齐

Result: 实验结果表明该方法实现了最先进的性能，优于其他上循环基线方法

Conclusion: Router Upcycling技术有效解决了MoE上循环中路由器的局限性，显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have gained significant attention in deep
learning due to their dynamic resource allocation and superior performance
across diverse tasks. However, efficiently training these models remains
challenging. The MoE upcycling technique has been proposed to reuse and improve
existing model components, thereby minimizing training overhead. Despite this,
simple routers, such as linear routers, often struggle with complex routing
tasks within MoE upcycling. In response, we propose a novel routing technique
called Router Upcycling to enhance the performance of MoE upcycling models. Our
approach initializes multiple routers from the attention heads of preceding
attention layers during upcycling. These routers collaboratively assign tokens
to specialized experts in an attention-like manner. Each token is processed
into diverse queries and aligned with the experts' features (serving as keys).
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, outperforming other upcycling baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 小型语言模型在提示下能大量生成假新闻标题，现有质量检测模型对这些假标题的识别准确度低


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估小型语言模型生成假新闻标题的能力和风险，以及现有质量检测模型的有效性

Method: 使用14个小型语言模型（LLaMA、Gemma等）通过控制提示工程生成24,000个高低质量假新闻标题，然后用DistilBERT和bagging分类器进行质量检测

Result: SLM生成假标题的遵循率高，但质量检测模型的准确度仅35.2%-63.5%，识别效果差

Conclusion: 小型语言模型存在生成假新闻的风险，现有质量检测方法需要改进

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have the capability for text generation and may
potentially be used to generate falsified texts online. This study evaluates 14
SLMs (1.7B-14B parameters) including LLaMA, Gemma, Phi, SmolLM, Mistral, and
Granite families in generating perceived low and high quality fake news
headlines when explicitly prompted, and whether they appear to be similar to
real-world news headlines. Using controlled prompt engineering, 24,000
headlines were generated across low-quality and high-quality deceptive
categories. Existing machine learning and deep learning-based news headline
quality detectors were then applied against these SLM-generated fake news
headlines. SLMs demonstrated high compliance rates with minimal ethical
resistance, though there were some occasional exceptions. Headline quality
detection using established DistilBERT and bagging classifier models showed
that quality misclassification was common, with detection accuracies only
ranging from 35.2% to 63.5%. These findings suggest the following: tested SLMs
generally are compliant in generating falsified headlines, although there are
slight variations in ethical restraints, and the generated headlines did not
closely resemble existing primarily human-written content on the web, given the
low quality classification accuracy.

Motivation: 当前多模态时间序列预测方法依赖高质量文本输入，但实际应用中文本往往无法准确完整地反映历史时间序列信息，导致预测性能不稳定。

Method: 提出文本强化模型(TeR)生成强化文本，设计基于预测性能和任务相关性的强化学习奖励机制来优化模型，提升生成文本质量。

Conclusion: 通过强化文本模态可以有效改善多模态时间序列预测性能，提出的TeR模型和强化学习方法能够生成更高质量的文本，显著提升预测效果。

Abstract: Recent studies in time series forecasting (TSF) use multimodal inputs, such
as text and historical time series data, to predict future values. These
studies mainly focus on developing advanced techniques to integrate textual
information with time series data to perform the task and achieve promising
results. Meanwhile, these approaches rely on high-quality text and time series
inputs, whereas in some cases, the text does not accurately or fully capture
the information carried by the historical time series, which leads to unstable
performance in multimodal TSF. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the
textual content to improve the performance of multimodal TSF. In this paper, we
propose improving multimodal TSF by reinforcing the text modalities. We propose
a text reinforcement model (TeR) to generate reinforced text that addresses
potential weaknesses in the original text, then apply this reinforced text to
support the multimodal TSF model's understanding of the time series, improving
TSF performance. To guide the TeR toward producing higher-quality reinforced
text, we design a reinforcement learning approach that assigns rewards based on
the impact of each reinforced text on the performance of the multimodal TSF
model and its relevance to the TSF task. We optimize the TeR accordingly, so as
to improve the quality of the generated reinforced text and enhance TSF
performance. Extensive experiments on a real-world benchmark dataset covering
various domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which
outperforms strong baselines and existing studies on the dataset.

to validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our results show that CE-Bench
reliably measures the interpretability of sparse autoencoders and aligns well
with existing benchmarks, all without requiring an external LLM. The official
implementation and evaluation dataset are open-sourced under the MIT License.

TL;DR: RevBrowse是一个基于大语言模型的评论驱动推荐框架，通过PrefRAG模块动态检索相关评论来解决传统方法在上下文窗口限制和评论相关性筛选方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推荐任务中表现出色，但在评论推荐中存在两个主要挑战：1）在有限上下文窗口中动态利用用户评论效率低下；2）缺乏有效机制来优先处理与用户当前决策最相关的评论。

Method: 提出RevBrowse框架，受"浏览-决策"在线用户行为启发，将用户评论集成到基于LLM的重排序过程中。引入PrefRAG检索增强模块，将用户和物品表示解耦为结构化形式，并根据目标物品自适应检索偏好相关内容。

Result: 在四个Amazon评论数据集上的广泛实验表明，RevBrowse相比强基线模型取得了持续且显著的改进，展现了其在建模动态用户偏好方面的泛化能力和有效性。

Conclusion: RevBrowse不仅提升了推荐性能，还通过透明的检索增强过程提供了一定程度的可解释性，使影响最终推荐的评论可见化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in recommendation
tasks due to their strengths in language understanding, reasoning and knowledge
integration. These capabilities are especially beneficial for review-based
recommendation, which relies on semantically rich user-generated texts to
reveal fine-grained user preferences and item attributes. However, effectively
incorporating reviews into LLM-based recommendation remains challenging due to
(1) inefficient to dynamically utilize user reviews under LLMs' constrained
context windows, and (2) lacking effective mechanisms to prioritize reviews
most relevant to the user's current decision context. To address these
challenges, we propose RevBrowse, a review-driven recommendation framework
inspired by the "browse-then-decide" decision process commonly observed in
online user behavior. RevBrowse integrates user reviews into the LLM-based
reranking process to enhance its ability to distinguish between candidate
items. To improve the relevance and efficiency of review usage, we introduce
PrefRAG, a retrieval-augmented module that disentangles user and item
representations into structured forms and adaptively retrieves
preference-relevant content conditioned on the target item. Extensive
experiments on four Amazon review datasets demonstrate that RevBrowse achieves
consistent and significant improvements over strong baselines, highlighting its
generalizability and effectiveness in modeling dynamic user preferences.
Furthermore, since the retrieval-augmented process is transparent, RevBrowse
offers a certain level of interpretability by making visible which reviews
influence the final recommendation.

TL;DR: 提出Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS)解码策略，通过外部奖励模型在扩散过程中提供全局序列级信号，改善掩码扩散模型的非自回归生成顺序和性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准置信度采样方法导致掩码扩散模型的生成顺序类似于自回归过程，限制了非自回归建模的优势

Method: RWS在每一步扩散过程中评估整个中间序列质量，相应缩放token对数概率，通过全局序列连贯性指导token选择，促进更非自回归的生成顺序

Result: 实验表明RWS显著促进非自回归生成顺序，在多个评估指标上带来改进

Conclusion: 整合全局信号能有效增强掩码扩散模型的非自回归特性和整体性能

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive
alternative for large language modeling. Standard decoding methods for MDMs,
such as confidence-based sampling, select tokens independently based on
individual token confidences at each diffusion step. However, we observe that
this independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling
sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of
non-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose
Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an
external reward model to provide a principled global signal during the
iterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS
evaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token
logits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global
sequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of
tokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more
non-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical
justification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial
rank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward.
Experiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive
generation orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics.
These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in
enhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of
MDMs.

introduces a structured framework for designing an AI-powered Learning
Management System (AI-LMS) that integrates generative and conversational AI to

resulting AI-LMS features modular components -- including configurable prompts,
adaptive feedback loops, and multi-agent conversation flows -- aligned with
pedagogical paradigms such as behaviorist, constructivist, and connectivist
learning theories. By combining AI capabilities with human-centered design and
ethical safeguards, this study advances a practical model for AI integration in
education. Future research will validate and refine the system through
real-world implementation.

TL;DR: 本研究系统比较了编码器Transformer、解码器LLM和FastText在中文AI生成文本检测任务上的表现，发现LoRA微调的Qwen2.5-7B模型达到95.94%的测试准确率，展现出最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，对AI生成文本的准确检测需求日益增长，特别是在中文这种语言细微差别较大的语言中，现有方法面临显著挑战。

Method: 使用NLPCC 2025中文AI生成文本检测数据集，比较了编码器模型（Chinese BERT-large和RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large）、解码器模型（Qwen2.5-7B通过LoRA微调）和FastText基线。编码器模型采用基于提示的掩码语言建模方法微调，解码器模型使用指令格式输入和轻量级分类头。

Result: 编码器模型在分布偏移下性能显著下降（RoBERTa: 76.3%，BERT: 79.3%），FastText表现出词汇鲁棒性（83.5%）但缺乏深层语义理解，LoRA微调的Qwen2.5-7B达到95.94%测试准确率，具有优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于解码器的大语言模型结合参数高效微调在中文AI生成文本检测中表现出色，未来将探索新一代Qwen3模型、蒸馏变体和集成策略以进一步提升跨域鲁棒性。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has heightened the demand
for accurate detection of AI-generated text, particularly in languages like
Chinese, where subtle linguistic nuances pose significant challenges to current
methods. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison of encoder-based
Transformers (Chinese BERT-large and RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large), a decoder-only LLM
(Alibaba's Qwen2.5-7B/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned via Low-Rank
Adaptation, LoRA), and a FastText baseline using the publicly available dataset
from the NLPCC 2025 Chinese AI-Generated Text Detection Task. Encoder models
were fine-tuned using a novel prompt-based masked language modeling approach,
while Qwen2.5-7B was adapted for classification with an instruction-format
input and a lightweight classification head trained via LoRA. Experiments
reveal that although encoder models nearly memorize training data, they suffer
significant performance degradation under distribution shifts (RoBERTa: 76.3%
test accuracy; BERT: 79.3%). FastText demonstrates surprising lexical
robustness (83.5% accuracy) yet lacks deeper semantic understanding. In
contrast, the LoRA-adapted Qwen2.5-7B achieves 95.94% test accuracy with
balanced precision-recall metrics, indicating superior generalization and
resilience to dataset-specific artifacts. These findings underscore the
efficacy of decoder-based LLMs with parameter-efficient fine-tuning for robust
Chinese AI-generated text detection. Future work will explore next-generation
Qwen3 models, distilled variants, and ensemble strategies to enhance
cross-domain robustness further.

Conclusion: FIDES框架通过改进的事实分解和证据聚合机制，显著提升了归因问答的准确性和证据精确度。

Abstract: Attribution is crucial in question answering (QA) with Large Language Models
(LLMs).SOTA question decomposition-based approaches use long form answers to
generate questions for retrieving related documents. However, the generated
questions are often irrelevant and incomplete, resulting in a loss of facts in
retrieval.These approaches also fail to aggregate evidence snippets from
different documents and paragraphs. To tackle these problems, we propose a new
fact decomposition-based framework called FIDES (\textit{faithful context
enhanced fact decomposition and evidence aggregation}) for attributed QA. FIDES
uses a contextually enhanced two-stage faithful decomposition method to
decompose long form answers into sub-facts, which are then used by a retriever
to retrieve related evidence snippets. If the retrieved evidence snippets
conflict with the related sub-facts, such sub-facts will be revised
accordingly. Finally, the evidence snippets are aggregated according to the
original sentences.Extensive evaluation has been conducted with six datasets,
with an additionally proposed new metric called $Attr_{auto-P}$ for evaluating
the evidence precision. FIDES outperforms the SOTA methods by over 14\% in
average with GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini and Llama 70B series.

Method: 提出LegalChainReasoner框架，使用结构化法律链指导模型进行综合案件评估，整合事实前提、复合法律条件和量刑结论，实现灵活的知识注入和端到端意见生成。

Conclusion: 提出的司法意见生成任务和LegalChainReasoner框架能够更好地满足实际司法需求，通过统一生成法律推理和量刑判决，提高了生成意见的一致性和实用性。

Abstract: A criminal judicial opinion represents the judge's disposition of a case,
including the decision rationale and sentencing. Automatically generating such
opinions can assist in analyzing sentencing consistency and provide judges with
references to similar past cases. However, current research typically
approaches this task by dividing it into two isolated subtasks: legal reasoning
and sentencing prediction. This separation often leads to inconsistency between
the reasoning and predictions, failing to meet real-world judicial
requirements. Furthermore, prior studies rely on manually curated knowledge to
enhance applicability, yet such methods remain limited in practical deployment.
To address these limitations and better align with legal practice, we propose a
new LegalAI task: Judicial Opinion Generation, which simultaneously produces
both legal reasoning and sentencing decisions. To achieve this, we introduce
LegalChainReasoner, a framework that applies structured legal chains to guide
the model through comprehensive case assessments. By integrating factual
premises, composite legal conditions, and sentencing conclusions, our approach
ensures flexible knowledge injection and end-to-end opinion generation.
Experiments on two real-world and open-source Chinese legal case datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models.

Result: 模型表现出强大的领域理解能力，概念级准确率最高达到0.8，但精确匹配分数显著较低，特别是在测试阶段。两阶段推理管道部分改善了答案提取的精确性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了生物医学LLM应用中语义理解与精确答案评估之间的差距，需要进一步研究输出控制和后处理策略来改进严格格式化的输出生成。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evident for accurate question
answering across various domains. However, rigorous evaluation of their
performance on complex question-answering (QA) capabilities is essential before
deployment in real-world biomedical and healthcare applications. This paper
presents our approach to the MedHopQA track of the BioCreative IX shared task,
which focuses on multi-hop biomedical question answering involving diseases,
genes, and chemicals. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning strategy leveraging
LLaMA 3 8B, enhanced with a curated biomedical question-answer dataset compiled
from external sources including BioASQ, MedQuAD, and TREC. Three experimental
setups are explored: fine-tuning on combined short and long answers, short
answers only, and long answers only. While our models demonstrate strong domain
understanding, achieving concept-level accuracy scores of up to 0.8, their
Exact Match (EM) scores remain significantly lower, particularly in the test
phase. We introduce a two-stage inference pipeline for precise short-answer
extraction to mitigate verbosity and improve alignment with evaluation metrics.
Despite partial improvements, challenges persist in generating strictly
formatted outputs. Our findings highlight the gap between semantic
understanding and exact answer evaluation in biomedical LLM applications,
motivating further research in output control and post-processing strategies.

TL;DR: 提出Topic Model Translation (TMT)方法，无需对齐语料库即可将主题模型从一种语言迁移到另一种语言，特别适用于目标语言数据稀缺的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言环境下训练主题模型面临算法复杂、需要对齐语料和人工评估等挑战，特别是在开发者不熟悉目标语言或数据有限的情况下更加困难。

Method: TMT技术通过翻译主题模型本身而非文本，不需要元数据、嵌入向量或对齐语料库，能够重用现有的主题模型到不同语言。

Result: 通过定量和定性评估表明，TMT能够产生语义一致且连贯的主题翻译结果。

Conclusion: TMT为多语言主题建模提供了一种新颖、鲁棒且透明的解决方案，特别适合目标语言大规模语料不可用或人工翻译不可行的情况。

Abstract: The training of topic models for a multilingual environment is a challenging
task, requiring the use of sophisticated algorithms, topic-aligned corpora, and
manual evaluation. These difficulties are further exacerbated when the
developer lacks knowledge of the target language or is working in an
environment with limited data, where only small or unusable multilingual
corpora are available.
  Considering these challenges, we introduce Topic Model Translation (TMT), a
novel, robust and transparent technique designed to transfer topic models
(e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topic models) from one language
to another, without the need for metadata, embeddings, or aligned corpora. TMT
enables the reuse of topic models across languages, making it especially
suitable for scenarios where large corpora in the target language are
unavailable or manual translation is infeasible. Furthermore, we evaluate TMT
extensively using both quantitative and qualitative methods, demonstrating that
it produces semantically coherent and consistent topic translations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI对话系统的快速增长，如何有效评估这些系统成为一个关键挑战，需要在模型规模受限的情况下开发可靠的评估方法。

Method: 采用两种主要策略：1）通过提示使用语言模型作为评估器；2）训练基于编码器的分类和回归模型，所有模型参数都控制在130亿以下。

Result: 语言模型提示方法仅获得中等相关性但测试集排名第二；编码器模型在验证集上某些维度表现优异但测试集性能下降，主要原因是测试集评分范围与训练/验证集存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 在模型规模受限条件下，编码器模型在某些维度上具有潜力，但数据分布差异对性能影响显著；语言模型提示方法虽然相关性不高但整体表现相对稳定。

Abstract: The growing number of generative AI-based dialogue systems has made their
evaluation a crucial challenge. This paper presents our contribution to this
important problem through the Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC-12,
Track 1), where we developed models to predict dialogue-level,
dimension-specific scores. Given the constraint of using relatively small
models (i.e. fewer than 13 billion parameters) our work follows two main
strategies: employing Language Models (LMs) as evaluators through prompting,
and training encoder-based classification and regression models.
  Our results show that while LM prompting achieves only modest correlations
with human judgments, it still ranks second on the test set, outperformed only
by the baseline. The regression and classification models, with significantly
fewer parameters, demonstrate high correlation for some dimensions on the
validation set. Although their performance decreases on the test set, it is
important to note that the test set contains annotations with significantly
different score ranges for some of the dimensions with respect to the train and
validation sets.

Conclusion: 通过LLM生成多粒度难负样本组合课程学习策略，可有效提升文本嵌入模型的表征能力，为文本嵌入领域提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Text embedding models are essential for various natural language processing
tasks, enabling the effective encoding of semantic information into dense
vector representations. These models are typically optimized using triplets of
(query, positive, negative) data pairs for contrastive learning, where the
negative samples play a critical role in enhancing the model's ability to
discern subtle semantic distinctions. In this work, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Hard-negative (MGH) synthesis framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to generate diverse negative samples with varying levels
of similarity with the query. This approach facilitates a coarse-to-fine
curriculum learning strategy during supervised training, allowing the embedding
model to progressively learn more nuanced semantic representations. Meanwhile,
we propose an Anchor Token Aware (ATA) pooling method that assigns higher
weights to anchor tokens based on aggregation patterns observed in LLMs,
improving text embedding accuracy without increasing model complexity.
Comprehensive experiments on the MTEB benchmark demonstrate that our methods
achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing synthesis strategies
both with synthetic data and when combined with public retrieval datasets.

Motivation: 文本到图像模型作为强大的创意工具，存在放大有害社会偏见风险，需要系统评估和解决这些模型的表征偏见问题。

Method: 构建包含5种社会重要职业（CEO、护士、软件工程师、教师、运动员）的基准测试，使用5个先进模型（包括闭源和开源），比较中性提示与公平性控制提示的效果，对输出图像进行性别和种族标注分析。

Result: 提示工程能显著改变人口统计表征，但效果因模型而异：有些模型能有效多样化，有些会过度校正导致不现实的一致性，有些则反应很小。

Conclusion: 提示工程作为公平性干预手段既有潜力也有局限，需要结合模型层面的策略来全面解决偏见问题。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (TTI) models are powerful creative tools but risk amplifying
harmful social biases. We frame representational societal bias assessment as an
image curation and evaluation task and introduce a pilot benchmark of
occupational portrayals spanning five socially salient roles (CEO, Nurse,
Software Engineer, Teacher, Athlete). Using five state-of-the-art models:
closed-source (DALLE 3, Gemini Imagen 4.0) and open-source (FLUX.1-dev, Stable
Diffusion XL Turbo, Grok-2 Image), we compare neutral baseline prompts against
fairness-aware controlled prompts designed to encourage demographic diversity.
All outputs are annotated for gender (male, female) and race (Asian, Black,
White), enabling structured distributional analysis. Results show that
prompting can substantially shift demographic representations, but with highly
model-specific effects: some systems diversify effectively, others overcorrect
into unrealistic uniformity, and some show little responsiveness. These
findings highlight both the promise and the limitations of prompting as a
fairness intervention, underscoring the need for complementary model-level
strategies. We release all code and data for transparency and reproducibility

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在面对欺骗性和误导性提示时会产生奉承幻觉，即模型优先考虑与输入隐含视角的一致性而非准确性，这影响了生成内容的真实性。

Method: 设计两种范式生成对应的欺骗性/误导性输入来诱导奉承幻觉，然后提出协作对比解码(CCD)方法，通过对比诱导输入和转换后中性输入的输出分布偏差来缓解幻觉。

Result: 大量实验表明，CCD方法能有效缓解奉承幻觉，在不同任务中提高生成响应的真实性，且无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 协作对比解码是一种有效的奉承幻觉缓解方法，能够提升大语言模型在各种任务中的事实准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in
language understanding. However, when LLMs align their outputs with deceptive
and/or misleading prompts, the generated responses could deviate from the de
facto information. Such observations are known as fawning hallucinations, where
the model prioritizes alignment with the input's implied perspective over
accuracy and truthfulness. In this work, we analyze fawning hallucinations in
various natural language processing tasks and tailor the so-termed contrastive
decoding method for fawning-hallucination mitigation. Specifically, we design
two paradigms to generate corresponding deceptive and/or misleading inputs for
the consistent fawning hallucinations induction. Then, we propose the
collaborative contrastive decoding (CCD) to handle the fawning hallucinations
across different tasks in LLMs. By contrasting the deviation in output
distribution between induced and transformed neutral inputs, the proposed CCD
can reduce reliance on deceptive and/or misleading information without
requiring additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed CCD can effectively mitigate fawning hallucinations and improve the
factuality of the generated responses over various tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EviNote-RAG是一个新型的RAG框架，通过结构化检索-笔记-回答流程，训练模型生成简洁的支持性证据笔记(SENs)来提升问答性能，解决了传统检索-回答范式中噪声干扰和多跳推理错误积累的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索-回答范式存在两个主要问题：(1)检索证据中信号噪声比低，有用信息被无关内容淹没；(2)多跳推理中不完整或噪声段落导致错误积累。需要新的方法来提升检索信息的质量和推理的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出EviNote-RAG框架，采用结构化检索-笔记-回答流程。模型训练生成支持性证据笔记(SENs)，这些笔记是简洁的类人笔记，仅保留答案相关信息，突出不确定性，并明确说明无有用证据存在。同时引入证据质量奖励(EQR)，基于蕴含关系的信号来评估SENs是否逻辑支持最终答案。

Result: 在领域内和领域外QA基准测试中，EviNote-RAG在准确性、泛化性和训练稳定性方面持续优于强基线模型。在HotpotQA上获得20%的相对F1提升(+0.093)，Bamboogle上40%(+0.151)，2Wiki上91%(+0.256)，通过更密集的奖励和减少冗余实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: EviNote-RAG通过SENs和EQR的结合，引导模型进行忠实和鲁棒的推理，同时减少噪声影响。该方法不仅提升了性能，还增强了鲁棒性和效率，为检索增强生成提供了新的有效范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) empowered with retrieval mechanisms have
achieved strong progress in open-domain question answering (QA). Yet, the
conventional retrieve--then--answer paradigm often suffers from two key
limitations: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio in retrieved evidence, where useful
information is buried under irrelevant content, and (2) error accumulation in
multi-hop reasoning when incomplete or noisy passages are involved. To address
these challenges, we present EviNote-RAG, an agentic RAG framework that
introduces a structured retrieve--note--answer pipeline. Instead of directly
reasoning over raw retrievals, the model is trained to compose
Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), concise, human-like notes that preserve only
answer-relevant information, highlight uncertainty, and explicitly state when
no useful evidence exists. This distillation process is further reinforced by
the Evidence Quality Reward (EQR), an entailment-based signal that evaluates
whether SENs logically support the final answer. Together, SENs and EQR guide
the model toward faithful and robust reasoning, while reducing the impact of
noise. Experiments on in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks show that
EviNote-RAG consistently outperforms strong baselines in accuracy,
generalization, and training stability. In particular, it achieves
state-of-the-art results while enhancing robustness and efficiency, yielding
relative F1 gains of 20\% on HotpotQA (+0.093), 40\% on Bamboogle (+0.151), and
91\% on 2Wiki (+0.256) via denser rewards and reduced verbosity.

Motivation: 讽刺、反讽和挖苦通常用于表达幽默和批评，但有时会被误认为是事实报道，类似于假新闻。这些技术可以在更细粒度上应用，使讽刺信息能够融入新闻文章。目前缺乏句子级别的讽刺检测数据集。

Method: 构建了包含13,873个手动标注句子的罗马尼亚语数据集SeLeRoSa，涵盖社会问题、IT、科学和电影等多个领域。评估了多种基于LLM的基线模型在零样本和微调设置下的性能，以及基于transformer的基线模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为讽刺检测领域提供了首个句子级别的罗马尼亚语数据集，并展示了当前LLM模型在此任务上的局限性，为新的研究方向铺平了道路。

Abstract: Satire, irony, and sarcasm are techniques typically used to express humor and
critique, rather than deceive; however, they can occasionally be mistaken for
factual reporting, akin to fake news. These techniques can be applied at a more
granular level, allowing satirical information to be incorporated into news
articles. In this paper, we introduce the first sentence-level dataset for
Romanian satire detection for news articles, called SeLeRoSa. The dataset
comprises 13,873 manually annotated sentences spanning various domains,
including social issues, IT, science, and movies. With the rise and recent
progress of large language models (LLMs) in the natural language processing
literature, LLMs have demonstrated enhanced capabilities to tackle various
tasks in zero-shot settings. We evaluate multiple baseline models based on LLMs
in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, as well as baseline
transformer-based models. Our findings reveal the current limitations of these
models in the sentence-level satire detection task, paving the way for new
research directions.

Motivation: 由于因果语言模型的快速发展，预期其在序列标注任务上能超越停滞发展的编码器模型，但现有研究较少关注监督生成式序列标注这一更自然的设置。

Method: 提出SIFT方法，将序列标注任务重新表述为受限响应生成问题，结合上下文学习(从示例中学习)和监督微调，使因果语言模型能够有效处理序列标注。

Result: SIFT在多个标准序列标注任务上显著优于上下文学习和解码器作为编码器微调的基线方法，发现长上下文会降低生成式序列标注性能，但通过移除指令可以缓解这一问题。

Conclusion: 研究强调了基于响应的生成式任务表述对于实现有效序列标注性能的重要性，揭示了LLMs在序列标注任务中的优势和局限性。

Abstract: Sequence labeling (SL) tasks, where labels are assigned to tokens, are
abundant in NLP (e.g., named entity recognition and aspect-based sentiment
analysis). Owing to the intuition that they require bidirectional context, SL
tasks are commonly tackled with encoder-only models. Recent work also shows
that removing the causal mask in fine-tuning enables decoder-based LLMs to
become effective token classifiers. Less work, however, focused on (supervised)
generative SL, a more natural setting for causal LLMs. Due to their rapid
scaling, causal LLMs applied to SL are expected to outperform encoders, whose
own development has stagnated. In this work, we propose supervised in-context
fine-tuning (SIFT) for generative SL. SIFT casts SL tasks as constrained
response generation, natural to LLMs, combining (1) in-context learning (ICL)
from demonstrations with (2) supervised fine-tuning. SIFT considerably
outperforms both ICL and decoder-as-encoder fine-tuning baselines on a range of
standard SL tasks. We further find that although long context hinders the
performance of generative SL in both ICL and SIFT, this deficiency can be
mitigated by removing the instruction, as instructions are shown to be largely
unnecessary for achieving strong SL performance with SIFT. Our findings
highlight strengths and limitations of SL with LLMs, underscoring the
importance of a response-based generative task formulation for effective SL
performance.

Conclusion: 结构化知识整合能有效增强LLM在医学翻译任务中的表现，MedCOD框架展示了将领域专业知识集成到LLM中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: We present MedCOD (Medical Chain-of-Dictionary), a hybrid framework designed
to improve English-to-Spanish medical translation by integrating
domain-specific structured knowledge into large language models (LLMs). MedCOD
integrates domain-specific knowledge from both the Unified Medical Language
System (UMLS) and the LLM-as-Knowledge-Base (LLM-KB) paradigm to enhance
structured prompting and fine-tuning. We constructed a parallel corpus of 2,999
English-Spanish MedlinePlus articles and a 100-sentence test set annotated with
structured medical contexts. Four open-source LLMs (Phi-4, Qwen2.5-14B,
Qwen2.5-7B, and LLaMA-3.1-8B) were evaluated using structured prompts that
incorporated multilingual variants, medical synonyms, and UMLS-derived
definitions, combined with LoRA-based fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate that MedCOD significantly improves translation quality across all
models. For example, Phi-4 with MedCOD and fine-tuning achieved BLEU 44.23,
chrF++ 28.91, and COMET 0.863, surpassing strong baseline models like GPT-4o
and GPT-4o-mini. Ablation studies confirm that both MedCOD prompting and model
adaptation independently contribute to performance gains, with their
combination yielding the highest improvements. These findings highlight the
potential of structured knowledge integration to enhance LLMs for medical
translation tasks.

Result: 形成了开发通用知识引擎的新配方，能够支持透明、可控和自适应的智能系统

Conclusion: 结构和解构的互补作用为构建更强大的知识引擎提供了统一框架，连接了传统符号方法和现代数据驱动方法

Abstract: The making of knowledge engines in natural language processing has been
shaped by two seemingly distinct paradigms: one grounded in structure, the
other driven by massively available unstructured data. The structured paradigm
leverages predefined symbolic interactions, such as knowledge graphs, as priors
and designs models to capture them. In contrast, the unstructured paradigm
centers on scaling transformer architectures with increasingly vast data and
model sizes, as seen in modern large language models. Despite their divergence,
this thesis seeks to establish conceptual connections bridging these paradigms.
Two complementary forces, structure and destructure, emerge across both
paradigms: structure organizes seen symbolic interactions, while destructure,
through periodic embedding resets, improves model plasticity and generalization
to unseen scenarios. These connections form a new recipe for developing general
knowledge engines that can support transparent, controllable, and adaptable
intelligent systems.

Conclusion: 偏好优化与质量驱动优化的结合为构建更可靠、临床基础的医疗大语言模型提供了可扩展且有效的方法

Abstract: Medical question answering requires advanced reasoning that integrates domain
knowledge with logical inference. However, existing large language models
(LLMs) often generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical
reliability. We propose Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a
novel framework that uniquely combines reinforcement learning with
preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought
(CoT) performance. RPRO differentiates itself from prior approaches by
employing task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation
mechanism that aligns outputs with established clinical workflows, while
automatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike
traditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking
optimization based on the Bradley-Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence
regularization for stable training. Experiments on PubMedQA and MedQA-USMLE
show consistent improvements over strong baselines. Remarkably, our 1.1B
parameter model outperforms much larger 7B-13B models, including
medical-specialized variants. These findings demonstrate that combining
preference optimization with quality-driven refinement offers a scalable and
effective approach to building more reliable, clinically grounded medical LLMs.

information and technology. This paper illustrates the text classification
process on different datasets using some standard supervised machine learning
techniques. Text documents can be classified through various kinds of
classifiers. Labeled text documents are used to classify the text in supervised
classifications. This paper applies these classifiers on different kinds of
labeled documents and measures the accuracy of the classifiers. An Artificial
Neural Network (ANN) model using Back Propagation Network (BPN) is used with
several other models to create an independent platform for labeled and
supervised text classification process. An existing benchmark approach is used
to analyze the performance of classification using labeled documents.
Experimental analysis on real data reveals which model works well in terms of

Abstract: Ranking words is an important way to summarize a text or to retrieve
information. A word graph is a way to represent the words of a sentence or a
text as the vertices of a graph and to show the relationship among the words.
It is also useful to determine the relative importance of a word among the
words in the word-graph. In this research, the ranking of Bangla words are
calculated, representing Bangla words from a text in a word graph using various
graph based ranking algorithms. There is a lack of a standard Bangla word
database. In this research, the Indian Language POS-tag Corpora is used, which
has a rich collection of Bangla words in the form of sentences with their parts
of speech tags. For applying a word graph to various graph based ranking
algorithms, several standard procedures are applied. The preprocessing steps
are done in every word graph and then applied to graph based ranking algorithms
to make a comparison among these algorithms. This paper illustrate the entire
procedure of calculating the ranking of Bangla words, including the
construction of the word graph from text. Experimental result analysis on real
data reveals the accuracy of each ranking algorithm in terms of F1 measure.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了TaarofBench，首个评估LLM对波斯taarof文化规范理解能力的基准测试，发现主流LLM在文化能力方面存在显著差距，并通过微调方法显著提升了模型的文化对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在全球语境中难以处理特定文化沟通规范，特别是波斯taarof这种强调谦逊、间接和尊重的复杂礼仪系统，现有文化基准中缺乏对此的评估。

Method: 创建包含450个角色扮演场景的TaarofBench基准，涵盖12个社交互动主题，通过33名参与者（包括母语者、传承者和非伊朗人）的人类研究建立基线，使用监督微调和直接偏好优化来提升模型表现。

Result: 评估5个前沿LLM显示文化能力存在40-48%的准确率差距，波斯语提示能改善表现，标准"礼貌"评分常违反taarof规范。通过微调方法分别实现了21.8%和42.3%的文化对齐度提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发多样化、文化敏感的LLM奠定了基础，使应用能更好地处理复杂社交互动，揭示了西方礼貌框架在跨文化语境中的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle to navigate culturally specific
communication norms, limiting their effectiveness in global contexts. We focus
on Persian taarof, a social norm in Iranian interactions, which is a
sophisticated system of ritual politeness that emphasizes deference, modesty,
and indirectness, yet remains absent from existing cultural benchmarks. We
introduce TaarofBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLM understanding of
taarof, comprising 450 role-play scenarios covering 12 common social
interaction topics, validated by native speakers. Our evaluation of five
frontier LLMs reveals substantial gaps in cultural competence, with accuracy
rates 40-48% below native speakers when taarof is culturally appropriate.
Performance varies between interaction topics, improves with Persian-language
prompts, and exhibits gender-based asymmetries. We also show that responses
rated "polite" by standard metrics often violate taarof norms, indicating the
limitations of Western politeness frameworks. Through supervised fine-tuning
and Direct Preference Optimization, we achieve 21.8% and 42.3% improvement in
model alignment with cultural expectations. Our human study with 33
participants (11 native Persian, 11 heritage, and 11 non-Iranian speakers)
forms baselines in varying degrees of familiarity with Persian norms. This work
lays the foundation for developing diverse and culturally aware LLMs, enabling
applications that better navigate complex social interactions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的风格一致性评估指标和融合生成方法，用于提升危机沟通中语言模型生成回复的风格一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 危机沟通中自动化回复的风格一致性对于建立受影响人群信任至关重要，但现有研究很少关注这一问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先评估候选回复的风格，然后通过融合过程在实例层面进行优化整合，以生成高质量且风格一致的回复。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法在回复质量和风格均匀性方面均较基线方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该研究为危机沟通中的风格一致性问题提供了有效解决方案，对于提升自动化回复系统的可靠性和受信度具有重要意义。

Abstract: In response to the urgent need for effective communication with
crisis-affected populations, automated responses driven by language models have
been proposed to assist in crisis communications. A critical yet often
overlooked factor is the consistency of response style, which could affect the
trust of affected individuals in responders. Despite its importance, few
studies have explored methods for maintaining stylistic consistency across
generated responses. To address this gap, we propose a novel metric for
evaluating style consistency and introduce a fusion-based generation approach
grounded in this metric. Our method employs a two-stage process: it first
assesses the style of candidate responses and then optimizes and integrates
them at the instance level through a fusion process. This enables the
generation of high-quality responses while significantly reducing stylistic
variation between instances. Experimental results across multiple datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both
response quality and stylistic uniformity.

Abstract: Health misinformation spreading online poses a significant threat to public
health. Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating
counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing
approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy
level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of
counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In
particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels,
enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a
reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective
readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health
literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms
baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This
research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health
communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech
to health misinformation.

Method: 使用包含1000个多选题的基准测试，涵盖多样化的继承场景，测试模型理解继承背景和计算伊斯兰法规定的份额分配的能力。

Result: o3和Gemini 2.5模型准确率超过90%，表现优异；而ALLaM、Fanar、LLaMA和Mistral模型准确率低于50%，表现较差。错误分析显示模型存在继承场景误解、法律规则应用错误和领域知识不足等问题。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了不同模型在伊斯兰法律推理能力上的显著差异，指出了模型在处理结构化法律推理方面的局限性，并为改进伊斯兰法律推理性能提供了方向。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models in Islamic inheritance law, known as 'ilm al-mawarith. We
assess the performance of seven LLMs using a benchmark of 1,000 multiple-choice
questions covering diverse inheritance scenarios, designed to test models'
ability to understand the inheritance context and compute the distribution of
shares prescribed by Islamic jurisprudence. The results reveal a significant
performance gap: o3 and Gemini 2.5 achieved accuracies above 90%, whereas
ALLaM, Fanar, LLaMA, and Mistral scored below 50%. These disparities reflect
important differences in reasoning ability and domain adaptation. We conduct a
detailed error analysis to identify recurring failure patterns across models,
including misunderstandings of inheritance scenarios, incorrect application of
legal rules, and insufficient domain knowledge. Our findings highlight
limitations in handling structured legal reasoning and suggest directions for
improving performance in Islamic legal reasoning. Code:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 乌尔都语中-ya: kar结构的完成体形式在现代语言中极不合法，尽管19世纪文学中自由存在，这种历时变化源于形态句法冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究乌尔都语动词和体组合中的范式空白，特别是-ya: kar结构的完成体形式从19世纪到现代的语法地位变化。

Method: 通过历史文本分析、大规模语料库研究确认完成体形式的缺失，以及母语者的主观评价任务来判断语法自然性。

Result: 发现完成体形式在现代乌尔都语中高度不自然，这种空白源于主格主语要求与及物完成体赋予作格的核心语法规则之间的冲突。

Conclusion: 形态句法冲突导致完成体形式不稳定，其他结构的功能性替代使这种空白在现代语法中固化。

Abstract: In this paper, we document a paradigm gap in the combinatorial possibilities
of verbs and aspect in Urdu: the perfective form of the -ya: kar construction
(e.g. ro-ya: ki: cry-Pfv do.Pfv) is sharply ungrammatical in modern Urdu and
Hindi, despite being freely attested in 19th century literature. We investigate
this diachronic shift through historical text analysis, a large-scale corpus
study which confirms the stark absence of perfective forms and subjective
evaluation tasks with native speakers, who judge perfective examples as highly
unnatural. We argue that this gap arose from a fundamental morphosyntactic
conflict: the construction's requirement for a nominative subject and an
invariant participle clashes with the core grammatical rule that transitive
perfective assign ergative case. This conflict rendered the perfective form
unstable, and its functional replacement by other constructions allowed the gap
to become entrenched in the modern grammar.

TL;DR: DistilledPRAG是一种知识蒸馏的参数化RAG模型，通过将文档编码为LoRA参数来保护隐私，同时保持标准RAG的性能和泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前RAG系统需要上传明文文档到云端导致的隐私泄露问题，以及现有参数化RAG方法存在的推理延迟高和泛化能力差的问题

Method: 首先合成单文档和多文档的QA对增强跨文档推理，然后用特殊标记掩码明文文档并通过参数生成器转换为LoRA，最后通过知识蒸馏训练参数生成器以匹配标准RAG的隐藏状态和输出logits

Result: 在四个QA数据集上的实验表明，DistilledPRAG在准确率上优于基线方法，并在分布外数据上表现出良好的泛化能力

Conclusion: DistilledPRAG成功实现了高效参数化同时保持RAG级别性能的目标，为隐私保护推理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The current RAG system requires uploading plaintext documents to the cloud,
risking private data leakage. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by encoding
documents as LoRA within LLMs, enabling reasoning without exposing raw content.
However, it still faces two issues: (1) PRAG demands synthesizing QA pairs and
fine-tuning LLM for each individual document to create its corresponding LoRA,
leading to unacceptable inference latency. (2) The performance of PRAG relies
solely on synthetic QA data, lacking internal alignment with standard RAG,
resulting in poor generalization on out-of-distribution(OOD) inputs. Therefore,
achieving high-efficiency parameterization while maintaining RAG-level
performance remains a critical challenge for privacy-preserving reasoning. In
this paper, we propose DistilledPRAG, a generalizable knowledge-distilled
parametric RAG model aligned with standard RAG in document structure and
parameter activation. We first synthesize QA pairs from single and
multi-documents to enhance cross-document reasoning. Then, we mask the
plaintext documents with a special token and translate them to LoRA via a
parameter generator, maintaining the standard RAG document structure. Finally,
guided by synthetic QA data, we train the parameter generator to match standard
RAG's hidden states and output logits, enabling RAG-style reasoning without
original documents. Experiments on four QA datasets show that DistilledPRAG
outperforms baselines in accuracy and generalizes well on OOD data.

TL;DR: REFRAG是一个针对RAG应用的高效解码框架，通过压缩、感知和扩展技术，利用检索上下文的稀疏性结构，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG应用中，LLM的长上下文主要由检索到的段落组成，但只有小部分与查询直接相关，导致大量不必要的计算。传统方法在处理长上下文时存在延迟高和内存需求大的问题。

Method: 提出REFRAG框架，通过分析RAG上下文的块对角注意力模式，识别并消除不必要的计算。采用压缩、感知和扩展三个步骤来优化解码过程。

Result: 实验显示REFRAG实现了30.85倍的首词时间加速（相比之前工作提升3.75倍），困惑度无损失，并能将LLM的上下文大小扩展16倍。

Conclusion: REFRAG在RAG、多轮对话和长文档摘要等多种长上下文任务中均表现出色，相比LLaMA和其他先进基线方法，在保持准确性的同时提供了显著的速度提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and
agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,
processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and
demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced
throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system
efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary
objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In
RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,
with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often
exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during
re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those
in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most
computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be
eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG,
an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve
latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we
demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to
previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization
framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs
by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context
tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document
summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm
that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to
LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.

Motivation: 研究自然语境段落的演变如何影响生成式大型语言模型在问答任务中的表现，探究模型对文本变化的敏感度。

Method: 提出了一个框架来整理自然演变的人类编辑版本阅读段落，通过语义相似度评分量化变体与预训练内容的对齐程度，评估了6个QA数据集和8个LLM。

Result: 实验显示LLM性能随着阅读段落与预训练版本的自然差异而下降，例如BoolQ数据集的平均模型准确率从最高到最低相似度区间下降了30%以上，多个模型的斜率超过70。

Conclusion: 自然文本演变对LLM的语言理解能力构成了重大挑战，表明模型对训练数据的特定版本存在过度依赖。

Abstract: How does the natural evolution of context paragraphs affect question
answering in generative Large Language Models (LLMs)? To investigate this, we
propose a framework for curating naturally evolved, human-edited variants of
reading passages from contemporary QA benchmarks and for analyzing LLM
performance across a range of semantic similarity scores, which quantify how
closely each variant aligns with content seen during pretraining. Using this
framework, we evaluate six QA datasets and eight LLMs with publicly available
training data. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance declines as reading
passages naturally diverge from the versions encountered during
pretraining-even when the question and all necessary information remains
present at inference time. For instance, average model accuracy on BoolQ drops
by over 30% from the highest to lowest similarity bins, with slopes exceeding
70 across several LLMs. These findings suggest that natural text evolution
poses a significant challenge to the language understanding capabilities of
LLMs.

Abstract: We present Dream-Coder 7B, an open-source discrete diffusion language model
for code generation that exhibits emergent any-order generation capabilities.
Unlike traditional autoregressive (AR) models that decode strictly
left-to-right, Dream-Coder 7B adaptively determines its decoding strategy based
on the coding task: sketch-first generation for complex algorithms,
left-to-right generation for straightforward completions, and interleaved
reasoning generation for code understanding tasks. We adapt a pretrained AR
checkpoint to a discrete diffusion frameworks with a continuous-time weighted
cross-entropy objective. Our post-training recipe comprises (i) supervised
fine-tuning, where we mitigate padding pathologies via random truncation and a
padding penalty to improve sample efficiency and stabilize generation; and (ii)
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards over a curated high-quality
prompt set drawn from open-source datasets, using a tailored reinforcement
learning recipe for diffusion language models. The resulting Dream-Coder 7B
Instruct attains 21.4\% pass@1 on LiveCodeBench (2410--2505) and demonstrates
competitive performance on HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and CRUXEval. We
release Dream-Coder-7B and Dream-Coder-7B-Instruct checkpoints, training

Method: 使用大语言模型进行实体对齐的双重翻译策略，并通过多语言维基百科数据微调大语言模型来增强源语言到目标语言的实体对齐

Result: 

Conclusion: EAT方法通过实体对齐翻译策略有效解决了非拉丁语系语言在跨语言命名实体识别中的知识迁移挑战

Abstract: Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition (CL-NER) aims to transfer knowledge
from high-resource languages to low-resource languages. However, existing
zero-shot CL-NER (ZCL-NER) approaches primarily focus on Latin script language
(LSL), where shared linguistic features facilitate effective knowledge
transfer. In contrast, for non-Latin script language (NSL), such as Chinese and
Japanese, performance often degrades due to deep structural differences. To
address these challenges, we propose an entity-aligned translation (EAT)
approach. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), EAT employs a
dual-translation strategy to align entities between NSL and English. In
addition, we fine-tune LLMs using multilingual Wikipedia data to enhance the
entity alignment from source to target languages.

different IE tasks and eras, while a task-era-aware router mechanism
dynamically allocates expert contributions. Experiments show that Tea-MOELoRA
outperforms both single-task and joint LoRA baselines, demonstrating its
ability to leverage task and temporal knowledge effectively.

Motivation: 现有LLM增强的KGC方法存在两个关键挑战：1)忽略自然语言与图结构表示空间的不一致性；2)为不同KGC任务设计单独指令导致重复工作和耗时过程

Method: 提出SAT框架：1)通过多任务对比学习进行层次知识对齐，将图嵌入与自然语言空间对齐；2)通过结构指令调优，使用统一图指令和轻量级知识适配器指导LLM进行结构感知推理

Result: 在四个基准数据集的两个KGC任务上，SAT显著优于最先进方法，特别是在链接预测任务中提升8.7%到29.8%

Conclusion: SAT框架通过结构感知对齐调优有效解决了KGC中的表示空间不一致和指令设计冗余问题，显著提升了LLM在知识图谱补全任务中的性能

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer new knowledge and make
predictions from knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities. LLM-enhanced KGC methods primarily
focus on designing task-specific instructions, achieving promising
advancements. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing
methods often ignore the inconsistent representation spaces between natural
language and graph structures. Second, most approaches design separate
instructions for different KGC tasks, leading to duplicate works and
time-consuming processes. To address these challenges, we propose SAT, a novel
framework that enhances LLMs for KGC via structure-aware alignment-tuning.
Specifically, we first introduce hierarchical knowledge alignment to align
graph embeddings with the natural language space through multi-task contrastive
learning. Then, we propose structural instruction tuning to guide LLMs in
performing structure-aware reasoning over KGs, using a unified graph
instruction combined with a lightweight knowledge adapter. Experimental results
on two KGC tasks across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAT
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in the link
prediction task with improvements ranging from 8.7% to 29.8%.

Conclusion: 提出的合成数据生成框架为解决长上下文数据集稀缺问题提供了有效解决方案，有助于推动LLM在长文本处理方面的发展。

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to process and reason over long
textual inputs is critical for a wide range of real-world applications.
However, progress in this area is significantly constrained by the absence of
high-quality, diverse, and verifiable long-context datasets suitable for both
training and evaluation. This work introduces a modular, extensible framework
for synthetic long-context data generation via prompt-based interaction with
LLMs. The framework supports multiple training and alignment objectives,
including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). It encompasses four core
generation paradigms: multi-turn conversational dialogues, document-grounded
input-output pairs, verifiable instruction-response tasks, and long-context
reasoning examples. Through templated prompting, a model-agnostic architecture,
and metadata-enriched outputs, the proposed approach facilitates scalable,
controllable, and purpose-aligned dataset creation for advancing long-context
capabilities in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统越来越依赖自然语言原则进行治理，但语言固有的解释性模糊问题尚未得到充分探索。与法律系统不同，AI对齐流程缺乏相应的制度保障来管理这种模糊性，导致相同规则的不同解释可能产生不一致或不稳定的模型行为

Method: 借鉴法律理论，提出了一个计算框架，包含两个法律机制：(1) 规则精炼流程，通过修订模糊规则来最小化解释分歧（类似于机构规则制定或迭代立法行动）；(2) 基于提示的解释约束，减少规则应用中的不一致性（类似于指导司法裁量权的法律准则）

Result: 在WildChat数据集的5,000个场景子集上评估了该框架，结果显示两种干预措施都显著提高了合理解释者小组的判断一致性

Conclusion: 该方法为系统管理解释性模糊性提供了第一步，是构建更健壮、遵循法律的AI系统的关键步骤

these principles are written and how they are applied. But while legal systems
use institutional safeguards to manage such ambiguity, such as transparent
appellate review policing interpretive constraints, AI alignment pipelines
offer no comparable protections. Different interpretations of the same rule can
lead to inconsistent or unstable model behavior. Drawing on legal theory, we
identify key gaps in current alignment pipelines by examining how legal systems
constrain ambiguity at both the rule creation and rule application steps. We
then propose a computational framework that mirrors two legal mechanisms: (1) a
rule refinement pipeline that minimizes interpretive disagreement by revising
ambiguous rules (analogous to agency rulemaking or iterative legislative
action), and (2) prompt-based interpretive constraints that reduce
inconsistency in rule application (analogous to legal canons that guide
judicial discretion). We evaluate our framework on a 5,000-scenario subset of
the WildChat dataset and show that both interventions significantly improve
judgment consistency across a panel of reasonable interpreters. Our approach
offers a first step toward systematically managing interpretive ambiguity, an
essential step for building more robust, law-following AI systems.

Abstract: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications presents
significant challenges, particularly in balancing computational efficiency and
performance. Optimizing acceleration after the fine-tuning phase and during
inference is crucial for building an efficient architecture. This paper
introduces Zero-Shot Adjustable Acceleration, a novel training and inference
method that dynamically adjusts hardware usage during inference without
requiring additional fine-tuning. The proposed approach is applied to newly
developed models and evaluated across multiple classification and text
generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the method enables a
wide range of acceleration in a zero-shot manner and achieves up to a 11x
speedup compared to the baseline.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SimulMEGA是一个无监督策略学习框架，通过混合专家门控机制实现同时语音翻译，在保持低延迟的同时显著提升翻译质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有同时语音翻译系统在平衡翻译质量、延迟和语义连贯性方面存在困难，特别是在多语言多对多场景中，不同的读写策略阻碍了统一策略学习

Method: 结合前缀训练和混合专家精炼器的无监督策略学习框架，以隐式方式学习有效的读写决策，无需增加推理时间开销，仅需对标准Transformer架构进行最小修改

Result: 在6个语言对上的评估显示，5亿参数的语音转文本模型优于Seamless基线，在1.5秒平均延迟下BLEU下降低于7%，在3秒延迟下低于3%。同时扩展到流式TTS任务也表现出优越的延迟质量权衡

Conclusion: SimulMEGA框架在同时语音翻译和流式文本转语音任务中都表现出色，实现了翻译质量、延迟和语义连贯性的良好平衡，具有很好的泛化能力

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) enables real-time cross-lingual
communication by jointly optimizing speech recognition and machine translation
under strict latency constraints. Existing systems struggle to balance
translation quality, latency, and semantic coherence, particularly in
multilingual many-to-many scenarios where divergent read and write policies
hinder unified strategy learning. In this paper, we present SimulMEGA
(Simultaneous Generation by Mixture-of-Experts Gating), an unsupervised policy
learning framework that combines prefix-based training with a
Mixture-of-Experts refiner to learn effective read and write decisions in an
implicit manner, without adding inference-time overhead. Our design requires
only minimal modifications to standard transformer architectures and
generalizes across both speech-to-text and text-to-speech streaming tasks.
Through comprehensive evaluation on six language pairs, our 500M parameter
speech-to-text model outperforms the Seamless baseline, achieving under 7
percent BLEU degradation at 1.5 seconds average lag and under 3 percent at 3
seconds. We further demonstrate the versatility of SimulMEGA by extending it to
streaming TTS with a unidirectional backbone, yielding superior latency quality
tradeoffs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于模型增长策略（特别是transformer堆叠）在缓解大语言模型持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题上的效果，发现该方法在阅读理解等任务上能减少性能退化，但在社会偏见处理方面存在权衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾难性遗忘是持续学习中的主要挑战，特别是在大语言模型持续微调时会丢失先前学到的知识。模型增长策略通过利用小模型来加速和结构化大模型训练，但其对遗忘问题的影响尚未充分探索

Method: 使用基于增长的预训练方法（transformer堆叠）构建Stack LLM模型，与不使用增长策略的基线LLM进行比较，在一系列微调任务（领域知识、推理、阅读理解、偏见评估）上评估灾难性遗忘程度

Result: 两种模型在领域知识上都有改进，但推理和阅读理解性能随时间退化。Stack LLM在所有任务中退化程度较小，特别是在阅读理解上表现更好。在偏见评估中，基线LLM变得更中立，而Stack LLM保持约60-61%的稳定偏见比例

Conclusion: 基于增长的预训练在抵抗灾难性遗忘方面能带来适度改进，但在处理社会偏见方面存在权衡，需要进一步研究平衡知识保留和偏见控制的方法

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a significant challenge in continual learning, in
which a model loses prior knowledge when it is fine-tuned on new tasks. This
problem is particularly critical for large language models (LLMs) undergoing
continual learning, as retaining performance across diverse domains is
important for their general utility. In this paper, we explore model growth, a
promising strategy that leverages smaller models to expedite and structure the
training of larger ones for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem.
Although growth-based pretraining, particularly via transformer stacking, has
shown promise in accelerating convergence, its impact on forgetting remains
under-explored. Therefore, we evaluate whether growth-based models can retain
previously learned capabilities more effectively across a sequence of
fine-tuning tasks involving domain knowledge, reasoning, reading comprehension,
and bias. Our findings show that both models -- one trained with growth (Stack
LLM) and one without (LLM) -- exhibit improvements in domain knowledge.
However, reasoning and reading comprehension degrade over time, indicating
signs of catastrophic forgetting. Stack LLM consistently shows less
degradation, especially in reading comprehension, suggesting enhanced retention
capabilities. Interestingly, in bias evaluation, the baseline LLM becomes
progressively more neutral with continued fine-tuning, while Stack LLM
maintains a steady bias ratio around 60--61\%. These results indicate that
growth-based pretraining may deliver modest improvements in resisting
catastrophic forgetting, though trade-offs remain in handling social biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用任务上表现优异，但在领域特定任务上表现不佳，需要针对特定数据进行微调。面对众多开源LLM，如何快速选择最优模型进行下游任务微调是一个挑战

Method: 1) 数据层面：建立数据过滤方法分类体系（分布感知、质量感知、混合方法），增强关键token密度实现token压缩，使用LLM迭代重写文本优化表达；2) 模型层面：使用层相似性评分评估各层重要性，移除低重要性层，引入稀疏合并范式保留原始模型能力

Result: 在医疗问答、金融问答、通用问答和阅读理解四个数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法能够选择最优LLM，同时节省约20倍的训练时间

Conclusion: DaMoC框架有效解决了LLM选择问题，通过数据模型双重压缩技术显著提升了微调效率，为领域特定任务提供了实用的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle with
domain-specific ones, requiring fine-tuning with specific data. With many
open-source LLMs available, selecting the best model for fine-tuning downstream
tasks is challenging, primarily focusing on how to quickly identify the optimal
LLM. We introduce a Data and Model Compression Framework (DaMoC) that addresses
this challenge by: 1) Data Level: A systematic categorization of data filtering
methodologies for LLMs is first established, classifying them into three
distinct paradigms: (1) distribution-aware methods, (2) quality-aware methods,
and (3) hybrid approaches considering both dimensions. Further, we enhance the
density of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we
use an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model
Level: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and
remove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging
paradigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible.
Extensive experiments on four datasets, medical Q&A, financial Q&A, general
Q&A, and reading comprehension, show that we can select the optimal LLM while
saving approximately 20-fold in training time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管思维链推理在提升模型推理能力方面日益重要，但其底层工作机制仍不明确，需要从上下文学习与预训练先验的交互关系角度进行深入研究。

Method: 采用细粒度词汇级分析、逐步引入噪声示例的实验设计，以及提示工程方法，系统研究模型的推理行为和决策机制。

Result: 发现模型能快速学习推理结构和逻辑模式但依赖预训练先验；足够示例可使决策从先验转向上下文信号；长思维链提示能生成更长推理链并提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 思维链推理的有效性源于预训练先验与上下文学习的协同作用，提示工程可以诱导模型进行更深入的慢思考，为理解和改进推理能力提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing
model inference capabilities. Despite growing interest in Chain-of-Thought
reasoning, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This paper explores the
working mechanisms of Chain-of-Thought reasoning from the perspective of the
dual relationship between in-context learning and pretrained priors. We first
conduct a fine-grained lexical-level analysis of rationales to examine the
model's reasoning behavior. Then, by incrementally introducing noisy exemplars,
we examine how the model balances pretrained priors against erroneous
in-context information. Finally, we investigate whether prompt engineering can
induce slow thinking in large language models. Our extensive experiments reveal
three key findings: (1) The model not only quickly learns the reasoning
structure at the lexical level but also grasps deeper logical reasoning
patterns, yet it heavily relies on pretrained priors. (2) Providing sufficient
exemplars shifts the model's decision-making from pretrained priors to
in-context signals, while misleading prompts introduce instability. (3) Long
Chain-of-Thought prompting can induce the model to generate longer reasoning
chains, thereby improving its performance on downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感是人类社会功能中的关键现象，但在文本表现方面仍是一个广泛开放的课题。当前评估方法的情感理论框架未被充分利用，提供了与传统方法互补的不同视角。

Method: 使用人工标注的工业语料库，采用评估方法进行情感标注。训练语言模型来分析这些标注，建模标注过程并研究变异性来源。

Result: 标注表现出显著分歧但遵循稳定统计趋势。语言模型能够成功建模标注过程，变异性主要由底层语言特征驱动。语言模型能够基于评估标准区分情感情境。

Conclusion: 评估方法为情感分析提供了有价值的补充视角，语言模型能够有效捕捉情感标注的统计规律和语言特征，证明该方法在情感文本分析中的可行性。

Abstract: Emotion is a crucial phenomenon in the functioning of human beings in
society. However, it remains a widely open subject, particularly in its textual
manifestations. This paper examines an industrial corpus manually annotated
following an evaluative approach to emotion. This theoretical framework, which
is currently underutilized, offers a different perspective that complements
traditional approaches. Noting that the annotations we collected exhibit
significant disagreement, we hypothesized that they nonetheless follow stable
statistical trends. Using language models trained on these annotations, we
demonstrate that it is possible to model the labeling process and that
variability is driven by underlying linguistic features. Conversely, our
results indicate that language models seem capable of distinguishing emotional
situations based on evaluative criteria.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文主张从当前的"琐事中心范式"转向"有意文化评估"，系统性地检查评估中嵌入的文化假设，强调研究者立场性和参与式方法的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM文化对齐评估方法过于简化文化为静态事实或价值观，通过选择题或简答题测试，忽视了文化的多元性和互动性现实，以及文化假设在看似"中性"评估环境中的渗透。

Method: 提出"有意文化评估"框架，系统地表征评估中文化相关考虑因素的出现内容、方式和情境，强调研究者立场性在促进包容性、文化对齐的NLP研究中的重要性。

Result: 构建了一个系统性的文化评估理论框架，指出了当前基准测试实践的局限性，并为未来研究方向提供了指导。

Conclusion: 需要超越当前的基准测试实践，通过HCI启发的参与式方法论让社区参与评估设计，发现我们不知道存在的重要应用，推动更具包容性和文化敏感性的NLP评估方法。

Abstract: The prevailing ``trivia-centered paradigm'' for evaluating the cultural
alignment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly inadequate as these
models become more advanced and widely deployed. Existing approaches typically
reduce culture to static facts or values, testing models via multiple-choice or
short-answer questions that treat culture as isolated trivia. Such methods
neglect the pluralistic and interactive realities of culture, and overlook how
cultural assumptions permeate even ostensibly ``neutral'' evaluation settings.
In this position paper, we argue for \textbf{intentionally cultural
evaluation}: an approach that systematically examines the cultural assumptions
embedded in all aspects of evaluation, not just in explicitly cultural tasks.
We systematically characterize the what, how, and circumstances by which
culturally contingent considerations arise in evaluation, and emphasize the
importance of researcher positionality for fostering inclusive, culturally
aligned NLP research. Finally, we discuss implications and future directions
for moving beyond current benchmarking practices, discovering important
applications that we don't know exist, and involving communities in evaluation
design through HCI-inspired participatory methodologies.

Motivation: 解决LLM在表格问答任务中面临的结构异构性、目标数据定位困难和复杂推理瓶颈等工业应用挑战。

Method: 采用结构化表模式替代完全文本化表格，引入查询感知表缩放机制动态生成子表模式，使用程序思维策略将查询转换为可执行代码，并与ReAct范式集成实现迭代推理。

Result: 在DataBench数据集上比传统PoT方法准确率提升19.34%，在TableBench数据集的事实检查任务上提升25%。

Conclusion: TableZoomer框架在保持可用性优势的同时，显著提升了表格问答任务的性能和可扩展性，适用于不同规模的表格处理。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in the table question
answering (TQA) task through prompt engineering, they face challenges in
industrial applications, including structural heterogeneity, difficulties in
target data localization, and bottlenecks in complex reasoning. To address
these limitations, this paper presents TableZoomer, a novel LLM-powered,
programming-based agent framework. It introduces three key innovations: (1)
replacing the original fully verbalized table with structured table schema to
bridge the semantic gap and reduce computational complexity; (2) a query-aware
table zooming mechanism that dynamically generates sub-table schema through
column selection and entity linking, significantly improving target
localization efficiency; and (3) a Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) strategy that
transforms queries into executable code to mitigate numerical hallucination.
Additionally, we integrate the reasoning workflow with the ReAct paradigm to
enable iterative reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework maintains the usability advantages while substantially enhancing
performance and scalability across tables of varying scales. When implemented
with the Qwen3-8B-Instruct LLM, TableZoomer achieves accuracy improvements of
19.34% and 25% over conventional PoT methods on the large-scale DataBench
dataset and the small-scale Fact Checking task of TableBench dataset,
respectively.

TL;DR: 本文研究如何利用参数高效微调技术(PEFTs)在大语言模型上进行跨领域适配，特别是在低资源领域文本摘要任务中的表现。通过在14个不同领域数据集上测试6种PEFT方法，发现领域内适配器性能优于少样本学习和更大模型，并探索了跨领域适配器的使用策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然通用性强，但在适应新领域时面临挑战，特别是在低资源且无标注数据的领域。传统的全参数微调计算成本高、耗时，因此需要更高效的领域适应方法。

Method: 使用6种参数高效微调技术(PEFTs)在Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型上进行实验，在科学、医疗、法律和新闻等14个训练数据集上进行文本摘要任务评估，探索领域内适配器和跨领域适配器的使用策略。

Result: 实验表明，对于低资源领域，使用领域内适配器的推理性能优于少样本学习以及更大的Llama-3-70B-Instruct模型。在没有领域内适配器的情况下，跨领域适配器及其策略组合能够利用跨领域语言相似性，在低资源设置中获得更好的适应性和性能。

Conclusion: 参数高效微调技术特别是适配器方法，为低资源领域的领域适应提供了有效的解决方案，能够在不进行全参数微调的情况下实现良好的性能，同时探索跨领域语言相似性的利用策略为实际应用提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), being generic task solvers, are versatile.
However, despite the vast amount of data they are trained on, there are
speculations about their adaptation capabilities to a new domain. Additionally,
the simple fine-tuning of the model to incorporate knowledge of a new domain is
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This becomes more challenging
when the domain in question is also low-resource, and labeled data is
unavailable. We leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFTs) on
high-resource datasets to address these challenges to improve performance on
unseen low-resource domains. Throughout our experiments, we evaluate whether
intrinsic linguistic commonalities between datasets can be leveraged for
efficient domain adaptation. We benchmark six PEFTs with
\texttt{Llama-3-8B-Instruct} on 14 training datasets from the Scientific,
Medical, Legal, and News domains for a Text Summarization task. Our experiments
show that for low-resource domains, inference using Within-Domain Adapters can
achieve better performance than Few-Shot as well as a much larger
\texttt{Llama-3-70B-Instruct}. Lastly, in the absence of Within-Domain
Adapters, we explore the concept of using Cross-Domain Adapters as well as the
strategic combinations of adapters to leverage intrinsic language similarities
across domains, facilitating better adaptability and performance in
low-resource settings.

Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash, a 560-billion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
language model designed for both computational efficiency and advanced agentic
capabilities. Stemming from the need for scalable efficiency, LongCat-Flash
adopts two novel designs: (a) Zero-computation Experts, which enables dynamic
computational budget allocation and activates 18.6B-31.3B (27B on average) per
token depending on contextual demands, optimizing resource usage. (b)
Shortcut-connected MoE, which enlarges the computation-communication overlap
window, demonstrating notable gains in inference efficiency and throughput
compared to models of a comparable scale. We develop a comprehensive scaling
framework for large models that combines hyperparameter transfer, model-growth
initialization, a multi-pronged stability suite, and deterministic computation
to achieve stable and reproducible training. Notably, leveraging the synergy
among scalable architectural design and infrastructure efforts, we complete
model training on more than 20 trillion tokens within 30 days, while achieving
over 100 tokens per second (TPS) for inference at a cost of \$0.70 per million
output tokens. To cultivate LongCat-Flash towards agentic intelligence, we
conduct a large-scale pre-training on optimized mixtures, followed by targeted
mid- and post-training on reasoning, code, and instructions, with further
augmentation from synthetic data and tool use tasks. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that, as a non-thinking foundation model, LongCat-Flash delivers
highly competitive performance among other leading models, with exceptional
strengths in agentic tasks. The model checkpoint of LongCat-Flash is
open-sourced to foster community research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律基准无法评估开放式、条款基础的问答能力，需要专门设计基准来测试大语言模型在法律领域的多跳推理和条款基础回答能力。

Method: 使用混合LLM-人类专家流程创建226个场景化问答实例；提出ParSeR方法，通过生成参数化条款进行三阶段顺序检索；设计LF-Eval自动评估指标。

Result: ParSeR在多个LLM上表现最佳，相比标准检索方法，F1分数提升37.91，LF-Eval分数提升30.81，在不同推理深度上表现一致。

Conclusion: KoBLEX基准和ParSeR方法有效提升了法律问答的可靠性和可解释性，LF-Eval指标与人类判断高度相关，为法律AI应用提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performances in general
domains and are now extending into the expert domain of law. Several benchmarks
have been proposed to evaluate LLMs' legal capabilities. However, these
benchmarks fail to evaluate open-ended and provision-grounded Question
Answering (QA). To address this, we introduce a Korean Benchmark for Legal
EXplainable QA (KoBLEX), designed to evaluate provision-grounded, multi-hop
legal reasoning. KoBLEX includes 226 scenario-based QA instances and their
supporting provisions, created using a hybrid LLM-human expert pipeline. We
also propose a method called Parametric provision-guided Selection Retrieval
(ParSeR), which uses LLM-generated parametric provisions to guide legally
grounded and reliable answers. ParSeR facilitates multi-hop reasoning on
complex legal questions by generating parametric provisions and employing a
three-stage sequential retrieval process. Furthermore, to better evaluate the
legal fidelity of the generated answers, we propose Legal Fidelity Evaluation
(LF-Eval). LF-Eval is an automatic metric that jointly considers the question,
answer, and supporting provisions and shows a high correlation with human
judgments. Experimental results show that ParSeR consistently outperforms
strong baselines, achieving the best results across multiple LLMs. Notably,
compared to standard retrieval with GPT-4o, ParSeR achieves +37.91 higher F1
and +30.81 higher LF-Eval. Further analyses reveal that ParSeR efficiently
delivers consistent performance across reasoning depths, with ablations
confirming the effectiveness of ParSeR.

Abstract: Complex games have long been an important benchmark for testing the progress
of artificial intelligence algorithms. AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have
defeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal
attention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models
(LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the
question of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this
paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We
systematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse
card games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data,
and examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while
mastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the
performance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality
data, (2) LLMs can master multiple complex card games simultaneously, with
performance augmentation for games with similar rules and conflicts for
dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in general capabilities when
mastering complex games, but this decline can be mitigated by integrating a
certain amount of general instruction data. The evaluation results demonstrate
strong learning ability and versatility of LLMs.

TL;DR: 通过提取理性向量，可以将强化学习培养的理性能力转移到其他模型，避免重复计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的理性能力培养通常需要昂贵的优化过程，如强化学习，本研究尝试提取并转移这些能力

Method: 从相同初始化的Qwen2.5模型中提取理性向量（GRPO模型参数减去SFT模型参数），通过简单的向量加法应用到其他模型

Result: 在多个理性测试集上获得显著提升：GSM8K (+4.9%)、HumanEval (+4.3%)、SciQ (+1.7%)、BigBenchHard (+12.3%)，逆向操作导致性能下降

Conclusion: 理性能力可以从现有模型中提取并通过张量算术重用，为模型增强提供了一种实用方法

Abstract: Large language models often require costly optimization, such as
reinforcement learning, to master complex reasoning tasks. This work
demonstrates that reasoning ability, once learned, can be extracted and
transferred between models as a compact task vector. We source two publicly
available, identically initialized Qwen2.5 models, one fine-tuned with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and the other with group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) on the same dataset. From these, we extract a reasoning
vector: $v_{\text{reason}} = \theta_{\text{GRPO}} - \theta_{\text{SFT}}$. We
hypothesize that this vector captures the reasoning capability instilled by
reinforcement learning while factoring out shared knowledge from the SFT
process. When added to compatible instruction-tuned models through simple
arithmetic, this vector consistently improves performance across diverse
reasoning benchmarks: GSM8K (+4.9%), HumanEval (+4.3%), SciQ (+1.7%), and
BigBenchHard (+12.3% for the 1.5B model). The performance improvements persist
under adversarial conditions. Conversely, subtracting the vector causes
significant performance degradation (-11.8% on GSM8K), demonstrating the
vector's strong contribution to the model's reasoning abilities. This work
shows how reasoning capabilities, typically developed through expensive
training, can be extracted from existing open-source models and reused through
simple tensor arithmetic, offering a practical way to enhance models by
recycling prior computational investments.

Motivation: 解决数字空间中日益增长的仇恨言论问题，需要结合自动化系统的速度规模与人类审核员的判断力，同时提供决策解释以建立信任

Method: 构建AI代理系统，使用大语言模型配合专业工具：对比真实仇恨言论示例、BERT分类器标记有害信息、查询俚语词典、生成思维链推理、检查平台指南

Result: 实验结果显示该方法超越现有最先进方法，达到0.91的宏F1分数

Conclusion: 该工具通过支持AI与人类监督的协作，帮助减少网络危害，适用于审核员、安全团队和研究人员

Abstract: Online harms are a growing problem in digital spaces, putting user safety at
risk and reducing trust in social media platforms. One of the most persistent
forms of harm is hate speech. To address this, we need tools that combine the
speed and scale of automated systems with the judgment and insight of human
moderators. These tools should not only find harmful content but also explain
their decisions clearly, helping to build trust and understanding. In this
paper, we present WATCHED, a chatbot designed to support content moderators in
tackling hate speech. The chatbot is built as an Artificial Intelligence Agent
system that uses Large Language Models along with several specialised tools. It
compares new posts with real examples of hate speech and neutral content, uses
a BERT-based classifier to help flag harmful messages, looks up slang and
informal language using sources like Urban Dictionary, generates
chain-of-thought reasoning, and checks platform guidelines to explain and
support its decisions. This combination allows the chatbot not only to detect
hate speech but to explain why content is considered harmful, grounded in both
precedent and policy. Experimental results show that our proposed method
surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, reaching a macro F1 score of 0.91.
Designed for moderators, safety teams, and researchers, the tool helps reduce
online harms by supporting collaboration between AI and human oversight.

Motivation: 跨文档细粒度关系理解在许多应用领域至关重要，但缺乏高效的训练和评估数据集创建方法限制了自动化辅助研究的发展。

Method: 提出了一种域无关框架：首先生成和验证半合成的相互联系文档数据集，用于自动评估并选出性能最佳的链接方法，然后在自然文本对中进行深度人工评估。

Result: 在同行审查和新闻两个不同域中应用，结果显示结合检索模型和大语言模型能够获得178%的人工评审通过率，比单纯检索模型的精确度提升了两倍以上。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨应用场景下的跨文档理解研究提供了系统性方法，所创建的新数据集为跨文档任务（如媒体框架和同行审查）奠定了基础，并开源了代码、数据和注释协议。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained relations between documents is crucial for many
application domains. However, the study of automated assistance is limited by
the lack of efficient methods to create training and evaluation datasets of
cross-document links. To address this, we introduce a new domain-agnostic
framework for selecting a best-performing approach and annotating
cross-document links in a new domain from scratch. We first generate and
validate semi-synthetic datasets of interconnected documents. This data is used
to perform automatic evaluation, producing a shortlist of best-performing
linking approaches. These approaches are then used in an extensive human
evaluation study, yielding performance estimates on natural text pairs. We
apply our framework in two distinct domains -- peer review and news -- and show
that combining retrieval models with LLMs achieves 78\% link approval from
human raters, more than doubling the precision of strong retrievers alone. Our
framework enables systematic study of cross-document understanding across
application scenarios, and the resulting novel datasets lay foundation for
numerous cross-document tasks like media framing and peer review. We make the
code, data, and annotation protocols openly available.

Motivation: 研究神经音频编解码器生成的离散语音token是否具有类似自然语言的统计特性，以及这些特性如何影响语音合成的语义保持和音质

Method: 分析多种NAC模型产生的离散语音token，检验其是否符合Zipf定律、Heaps定律等语言统计规律，计算熵和冗余度，并通过自动语音识别错误率和UTMOS评分评估合成语音的清晰度和质量

Result: NAC token（特别是3-grams）展现出类似语言的统计模式，这些统计特性和信息量测量与语音识别和重合成任务的性能提升相关

Conclusion: NAC token序列具有语言般的统计结构，这一发现有助于设计更有效的生成式语音模型

Abstract: This study presents a comparative analysis of the statistical and linguistic
properties of neural audio codecs (NACs). We investigate discrete speech tokens
produced by various NAC models, examining their adherence to linguistic
statistical laws such as Zipf's law and Heaps' law, as well as their entropy
and redundancy. To assess how these token-level properties relate to semantic
and acoustic preservation in synthesized speech, we evaluate intelligibility
using error rates of automatic speech recognition, and quality using the UTMOS
score. Our results reveal that NAC tokens, particularly 3-grams, exhibit
language-like statistical patterns. Moreover, these properties, together with
measures of information content, are found to correlate with improved
performances in speech recognition and resynthesis tasks. These findings offer
insights into the structure of NAC token sequences and inform the design of
more effective generative speech models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在数学应用题上表现优异，但在元推理任务（如识别学生解答中的错误步骤）方面仍存在明显不足，特别是在定位第一步错误方面。

Method: 使用VtG和PRM800K两个错误推理数据集进行实验，提出生成中间修正学生解决方案的方法，使修正方案更贴近原始学生解答，从而提高错误定位性能。

Result: 实验表明，即使提供参考答案，最先进的LLMs也难以准确定位学生解答中的第一个错误步骤。提出的中间修正方法有效提升了错误定位的准确性。

Conclusion: 通过生成与原始学生解答更接近的中间修正方案，可以显著改善LLMs在识别和定位学生解题错误方面的能力，为解决元推理挑战提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on math word
problems, yet they have been shown to struggle with meta-reasoning tasks such
as identifying errors in student solutions. In this work, we investigate the
challenge of locating the first error step in stepwise solutions using two
error reasoning datasets: VtG and PRM800K. Our experiments show that
state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to locate the first error step in student
solutions even when given access to the reference solution. To that end, we
propose an approach that generates an intermediate corrected student solution,
aligning more closely with the original student's solution, which helps improve
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的思维链推理过程不透明，难以在高风险场景中进行验证、调试和控制，需要一种可视化交互方法来提升推理的可信度和准确性。

Method: 开发Vis-CoT框架，将线性CoT文本转换为交互式推理图，用户可以通过剪枝错误路径和嫁接新前提来干预推理过程，实现人机协作推理。

Result: 在GSM8K和StrategyQA数据集上，Vis-CoT比非交互式基线提高了最多24个百分点的最终答案准确率，用户研究显示可用性和信任度大幅提升。

Conclusion: Vis-CoT通过结合LLM与针对性人类监督，为更可靠、可理解和协作的推理提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong reasoning via chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting, but the process is opaque, which makes verification, debugging, and
control difficult in high-stakes settings. We present Vis-CoT, a
human-in-the-loop framework that converts linear CoT text into an interactive
reasoning graph. Users can visualize the logical flow, identify flawed steps,
and intervene by pruning incorrect paths and grafting new, user-defined
premises. This shifts interaction from passive observation to active
collaboration, steering models toward more accurate and trustworthy
conclusions. Across GSM8K and StrategyQA, Vis-CoT improves final-answer
accuracy by up to 24 percentage points over non-interactive baselines. A user
study also shows large gains in perceived usability and trust. Vis-CoT points
to a practical path for more reliable, understandable, and collaborative
reasoning by combining LLMs with targeted human oversight.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注美国或少数国家的人口群体意见，缺乏全球国家样本、不同历史时期人类意见研究，以及使用语言引导LLMs的讨论，同时忽视了提示语言对LLMs意见对齐的潜在影响。

Method: 基于世界价值观调查(WVS)创建评估框架，系统评估LLMs在全球不同国家、语言和历史时期与人类意见的对齐情况。

Result: LLMs仅与少数国家适当或过度对齐意见，而与大多数国家对齐不足；改变提示语言以匹配问卷语言能有效引导LLMs与对应国家意见对齐；LLMs更符合当代人群意见。

Conclusion: 这是首个在全球、语言和时间维度上全面调查LLMs意见对齐主题的研究，提供了评估框架和公开代码数据。

Abstract: Today's large language models (LLMs) are capable of supporting multilingual
scenarios, allowing users to interact with LLMs in their native languages. When
LLMs respond to subjective questions posed by users, they are expected to align
with the views of specific demographic groups or historical periods, shaped by
the language in which the user interacts with the model. Existing studies
mainly focus on researching the opinions represented by LLMs among demographic
groups in the United States or a few countries, lacking worldwide country
samples and studies on human opinions in different historical periods, as well
as lacking discussion on using language to steer LLMs. Moreover, they also
overlook the potential influence of prompt language on the alignment of LLMs'
opinions. In this study, our goal is to fill these gaps. To this end, we create
an evaluation framework based on the World Values Survey (WVS) to
systematically assess the alignment of LLMs with human opinions across
different countries, languages, and historical periods around the world. We
find that LLMs appropriately or over-align the opinions with only a few
countries while under-aligning the opinions with most countries. Furthermore,
changing the language of the prompt to match the language used in the
questionnaire can effectively steer LLMs to align with the opinions of the
corresponding country more effectively than existing steering methods. At the
same time, LLMs are more aligned with the opinions of the contemporary
population. To our knowledge, our study is the first comprehensive
investigation of the topic of opinion alignment in LLMs across global,
language, and temporal dimensions. Our code and data are publicly available at

TL;DR: UniCR是一个统一框架，将多种不确定性证据转换为校准的正确概率，通过原则性拒绝来执行用户指定的错误预算，提高语言模型的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部署的语言模型需要决定何时不回答，以避免错误回答。现有方法缺乏统一的框架来处理异构不确定性证据并提供风险控制保证。

Method: 使用温度缩放和适当评分学习轻量级校准头，支持黑盒模型，利用符合风险控制提供分布无关保证。对于长文本生成，通过检索证据监督原子事实性得分来对齐置信度和语义保真度。

Result: 在短问答、代码生成和检索增强长问答任务中，校准指标持续改进，风险覆盖曲线下面积降低，固定风险下覆盖率更高。

Conclusion: UniCR提供了一个可移植的证据融合到校准概率再到风险控制决策的解决方案，无需微调基础模型，在分布偏移下仍然有效，显著提高了模型的可信度。

Abstract: Deployed language models must decide not only what to answer but also when
not to answer. We present UniCR, a unified framework that turns heterogeneous
uncertainty evidence including sequence likelihoods, self-consistency
dispersion, retrieval compatibility, and tool or verifier feedback into a
calibrated probability of correctness and then enforces a user-specified error
budget via principled refusal. UniCR learns a lightweight calibration head with
temperature scaling and proper scoring, supports API-only models through
black-box features, and offers distribution-free guarantees using conformal
risk control. For long-form generation, we align confidence with semantic
fidelity by supervising on atomic factuality scores derived from retrieved
evidence, reducing confident hallucinations while preserving coverage.
Experiments on short-form QA, code generation with execution tests, and
retrieval-augmented long-form QA show consistent improvements in calibration
metrics, lower area under the risk-coverage curve, and higher coverage at fixed
risk compared to entropy or logit thresholds, post-hoc calibrators, and
end-to-end selective baselines. Analyses reveal that evidence contradiction,
semantic dispersion, and tool inconsistency are the dominant drivers of
abstention, yielding informative user-facing refusal messages. The result is a
portable recipe of evidence fusion to calibrated probability to risk-controlled
decision that improves trustworthiness without fine-tuning the base model and
remains valid under distribution shift.

Motivation: 大型语言模型训练后知识静态化，现有知识编辑方法要么过度依赖表面线索，要么在噪声多跳条件下表现不佳，需要更可靠的知识更新方法

Method: 端到端的推理链编辑框架，包含事实确认、相关性判定、选择性应用和最终推理四个结构化阶段，在单次处理中过滤干扰信息

Result: 在MQuAKE-CF数据集上，Reason-KE将Qwen2.5-7B的多跳问答准确率提升至90.2%，在强干扰下仅下降6.3%，答案泄露时下降<1%

Conclusion: Reason-KE建立了可靠LLM知识更新的新标准，在抗干扰性和效率方面表现出色，为知识编辑提供了更稳健的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of world knowledge but
remain static once trained, making the timely integration of emerging facts
prohibitively expensive via full retraining. Knowledge-editing techniques have
thus emerged to inject or overwrite specific facts into LLMs, yet they either
over-rely on superficial cues or incur complex, iterative pipelines that
collapse under noisy, multi-hop conditions. We introduce Reason-KE, an
end-to-end reasoning-chain-based editing framework that steers a pretrained LLM
through four structured stages-fact acknowledgment, relevance determination,
selective application, and final reasoning-to filter distractors in a single
pass. Trained on MQuAKE-CF with up to four irrelevant facts, Reason-KE elevates
Qwen2.5-7B's multi-hop QA accuracy to 90.2% while suffering merely a 6.3% drop
under heavy distraction and <1% when answers are leaked. Our quantitative
analysis confirms Reason-KE's resilience and efficiency, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for reliable LLM knowledge updates.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型(LLMs)会产生看似合理但事实错误的幻觉响应。虽然已有检索增强语言模型(RALMs)和拒绝后训练两种方法，但当前研究忽视了RALMs拒绝能力的评估，需要探究RALMs是否知道何时不知道。

Method: 通过三个核心问题进行研究：1）检查RALMs在不同内外知识状态下的校准程度；2）研究拒绝后训练对过度拒绝问题的影响，包括Refusal-aware指令微调和上下文微调方法；3）为拒绝后训练模型开发简单有效的拒绝方法来提高整体答案质量。

Result: 发现LLMs存在显著过度拒绝行为；上下文微调缓解了过度拒绝问题，但R-tuning放大了该问题；拒绝能力可能与答案质量存在冲突；开发的有效拒绝方法提高了拒绝和正确答案的整体质量。

Conclusion: 本研究全面理解了重要因素对RALM系统的影响，为解决LLMs幻觉问题提供了更深入的见解，并为改进拒绝能力和答案质量提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) occasionally generate plausible yet
factually incorrect responses, known as hallucinations. Researchers are
primarily using two approaches to mitigate hallucinations, namely Retrieval
Augmented Language Models (RALMs) and refusal post-training. However, current
research predominantly emphasizes their individual effectiveness while
overlooking the evaluation of the refusal capability of RALMs. In this study,
we ask the fundamental question: Do RALMs know when they don't know?
Specifically, we ask three questions. First, are RALMs well-calibrated
regarding different internal and external knowledge states? We examine the
influence of various factors. Contrary to expectations, we find that LLMs
exhibit significant \textbf{over-refusal} behavior. Then, how does refusal
post-training affect the over-refusal issue? We investigate the Refusal-aware
Instruction Tuning and In-Context Fine-tuning methods. Our results show that
the over-refusal problem is mitigated by In-context fine-tuning. but magnified
by R-tuning. However, we also find that the refusal ability may conflict with
the quality of the answer. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective refusal
method for refusal post-trained models to improve their overall answer quality
in terms of refusal and correct answers. Our study provides a more
comprehensive understanding of the influence of important factors on RALM
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统采用简单的top-k语义搜索，经常引入不相关或冗余信息，导致性能下降和效率降低。

Method: 五阶段模块化设计：初始检索、相关性验证、回退检索、上下文优先级排序和token预算管理，实现细粒度知识控制。

Result: 在Wikipedia数据集上减少57%上下文，在更复杂的HotpotQA数据集上减少75%，显著提升上下文效率。

Conclusion: MeVe为更可扩展和可靠的LLM应用提供了框架，通过精炼和蒸馏上下文信息，实现更好的基础和更准确的事实支持。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically face constraints
because of their inherent mechanism: a simple top-k semantic search [1]. The
approach often leads to the incorporation of irrelevant or redundant
information in the context, degrading performance and efficiency [10][11]. This
paper presents MeVe, a novel modular architecture intended for Memory
Verification and smart context composition. MeVe rethinks the RAG paradigm by
proposing a five-phase modular design that distinctly breaks down the retrieval
and context composition process into distinct, auditable, and independently
tunable phases: initial retrieval, relevance verification, fallback retrieval,
context prioritization, and token budgeting. This architecture enables
fine-grained control of what knowledge is made available to an LLM, enabling
task-dependent filtering and adaptation. We release a reference implementation
of MeVe as a proof of concept and evaluate its performance on knowledge-heavy
QA tasks over a subset of English Wikipedia [22]. Our results demonstrate that
by actively verifying information before composition, MeVe significantly
improves context efficiency, achieving a 57% reduction on the Wikipedia dataset
and a 75% reduction on the more complex HotpotQA dataset compared to standard
RAG implementations [25]. This work provides a framework for more scalable and
reliable LLM applications. By refining and distilling contextual information,
MeVe offers a path toward better grounding and more accurate factual support
[16].

Method: 使用BERTopic主题建模和cTF-IDF权重方法，结合词频分析，对两个时期的工会文档进行话语对比研究

Result: 现代Unite Community工会更符合向外的社会公正主题，而历史B&S工会更偏向传统的内部管理和服务模式，显示了不同的参与模式

Conclusion: 虽然两个工会都涉及社区主题，但其参与模式存在显著差异，挑战了社区工会主义在不同时期和行业间的连续性和普遍性假设

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of community unionism (CU) in two
distinct historical and organizational contexts: the National Boot and Shoe
Union (B\&S) in the 1920s and Unite Community in the 2010s--2020s. Using
BERTopic for thematic modeling and cTF-IDF weighting, alongside word frequency
analysis, the study examines the extent to which each union's discourse aligns
with key features of CU -- such as coalition-building, grassroots engagement,
and action beyond the workplace. The results reveal significant differences in
thematic focus and discursive coherence. While Unite Community demonstrates
stronger alignment with outward-facing, social justice-oriented themes, the
B\&S corpus emphasizes internal administration, industrial relations, and
member services -- reflecting a more traditional, servicing-oriented union
model. The analysis also highlights methodological insights, demonstrating how
modern NLP techniques can enhance the study of historical labor archives.
Ultimately, the findings suggest that while both unions engage with
community-related themes, their underlying models of engagement diverge
significantly, challenging assumptions about the continuity and universality of
community unionism across time and sector.

Conclusion: CAT方法成功将因果知识注入LLMs的注意力机制，显著提升了模型在因果推理和分布外泛化方面的能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, a fundamental question remains: Can LLMs effectively utilize
causal knowledge for prediction and generation? Through empirical studies, we
find that LLMs trained directly on large-scale data often capture spurious
correlations rather than true causal relationships, leading to suboptimal
performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this
challenge, we propose Causal Attention Tuning (CAT), a novel approach that
injects fine-grained causal knowledge into the attention mechanism. We propose
an automated pipeline that leverages human priors to automatically generate
token-level causal signals and introduce the Re-Attention mechanism to guide
training, helping the model focus on causal structures while mitigating noise
and biases in attention scores. Experimental results on our proposed Spurious
Token Game (STG) benchmark and multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our
approach effectively leverages causal knowledge for prediction and remains
robust in OOD scenarios. Implementation details can be found at

Method: 将API文档转换为结构化API图来捕获API依赖关系，并构建首个专家标注的API图数据集In-N-Out，基于两个真实API基准测试。

Result: 使用In-N-Out数据集后，工具检索和多工具查询生成的性能几乎翻倍，模型微调后能弥补90%的性能差距。

Conclusion: 显式API图对工具代理具有重要价值，In-N-Out数据集是理解API文档和参数关系的宝贵资源。

Abstract: Tool agents -- LLM-based systems that interact with external APIs -- offer a
way to execute real-world tasks. However, as tasks become increasingly complex,
these agents struggle to identify and call the correct APIs in the proper
order. To tackle this problem, we investigate converting API documentation into
a structured API graph that captures API dependencies and leveraging it for
multi-tool queries that require compositional API calls. To support this, we
introduce In-N-Out, the first expert-annotated dataset of API graphs built from
two real-world API benchmarks and their documentation. Using In-N-Out
significantly improves performance on both tool retrieval and multi-tool query
generation, nearly doubling that of LLMs using documentation alone. Moreover,
graphs generated by models fine-tuned on In-N-Out close 90% of this gap,
showing that our dataset helps models learn to comprehend API documentation and
parameter relationships. Our findings highlight the promise of using explicit
API graphs for tool agents and the utility of In-N-Out as a valuable resource.
We will release the dataset and code publicly.

TL;DR: EAGLE是一种基于自评估的校准方法，通过聚合LLM中间层的内部信念来获得更准确的置信度分数，显著改善了模型校准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然取得了显著成功，但经常表现出过度自信并生成看似合理但错误的答案，特别是在经过RLHF训练的模型中，这对可靠的uncertainty estimation和安全部署构成了重大挑战。

Method: 提出EAGLE方法，不依赖模型的最终输出，而是在自评估过程中从多个中间层提取内部信念，聚合这些层级信念并计算置信度分数分布的期望值，从而产生更准确反映模型内部确定性的精炼置信度分数。

Result: 在多样化数据集和LLM上的广泛实验表明，EAGLE在校准性能方面显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: EAGLE通过利用LLM内部隐藏状态来获得更准确的置信度分数，为解决LLM过度自信问题提供了有效的解决方案，有助于提高模型部署的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language tasks, but often exhibit overconfidence and generate
plausible yet incorrect answers. This overconfidence, especially in models
undergone Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), poses significant
challenges for reliable uncertainty estimation and safe deployment. In this
paper, we propose EAGLE (Expectation of AGgregated internaL bEief), a novel
self-evaluation-based calibration method that leverages the internal hidden
states of LLMs to derive more accurate confidence scores. Instead of relying on
the model's final output, our approach extracts internal beliefs from multiple
intermediate layers during self-evaluation. By aggregating these layer-wise
beliefs and calculating the expectation over the resulting confidence score
distribution, EAGLE produces a refined confidence score that more faithfully
reflects the model's internal certainty. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets and LLMs demonstrate that EAGLE significantly improves calibration
performance over existing baselines. We also provide an in-depth analysis of
EAGLE, including a layer-wise examination of uncertainty patterns, a study of
the impact of self-evaluation prompts, and an analysis of the effect of
self-evaluation score range.

### [309] [Testing the assumptions about the geometry of sentence embedding spaces: the cosine measure need not apply](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01606)
*Vivi Nastase,Paola Merlo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现句子嵌入空间中的几何距离并不能预测其在各种语言任务上的性能表现，余弦相似度只能捕捉浅层共性，语言信息是通过不同维度的加权组合编码的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究句子嵌入空间中距离的接近性是否能够延伸到句子嵌入的共享属性，即是否相似的句子嵌入在语言任务上表现也相似。

Method: 通过三种方式计算句子嵌入：平均词嵌入、特殊[CLS]标记嵌入和随机词嵌入，分析这些嵌入变体之间的距离与其在语言任务上性能的相关性。

Result: 结果显示余弦相似度只能捕捉句子嵌入之间的浅层共性或差异，这些差异不能预测在具体任务上的性能表现。

Conclusion: 语言信息是通过不同维度的加权组合编码的，而不是反映在句子嵌入空间的几何结构中，因此单纯的空间距离不能作为性能预测指标。

Abstract: Transformer models learn to encode and decode an input text, and produce
contextual token embeddings as a side-effect. The mapping from language into
the embedding space maps words expressing similar concepts onto points that are
close in the space. In practice, the reverse implication is also assumed: words
corresponding to close points in this space are similar or related, those that
are further are not.
  Does closeness in the embedding space extend to shared properties for
sentence embeddings? We present an investigation of sentence embeddings and
show that the geometry of their embedding space is not predictive of their
relative performances on a variety of tasks.
  We compute sentence embeddings in three ways: as averaged token embeddings,
as the embedding of the special [CLS] token, and as the embedding of a random
token from the sentence. We explore whether there is a correlation between the
distance between sentence embedding variations and their performance on
linguistic tasks, and whether despite their distances, they do encode the same
information in the same manner.
  The results show that the cosine similarity -- which treats dimensions
shallowly -- captures (shallow) commonalities or differences between sentence
embeddings, which are not predictive of their performance on specific tasks.
Linguistic information is rather encoded in weighted combinations of different
dimensions, which are not reflected in the geometry of the sentence embedding
space.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的基准来检测大语言模型生成的现代诗歌，并通过实验证明当前检测器无法可靠识别AI生成的现代诗歌。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，AI生成文本与人类文本难以区分。现代诗歌具有独特特征，AI生成诗歌的流行严重干扰了诗歌生态系统，异常紧迫需要检测方法。

Method: 首先构建了高质量数据集，包含6位专业诗人的800首诗歌和4个主流LLMs生成的41,600首诗歌。然后系统性评估了6个检测器在这个数据集上的性能。

Result: 实验结果显示当前检测器无法作为可靠工具检测LLMs生成的现代诗歌。最难检测的诗歌特征是内在品质，特别是风格。

Conclusion: 检测结果验证了我们提出的基准的有效性和必要性。本文工作为未来AI生成诗歌的检测奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapid development of advanced large language models (LLMs) has made
AI-generated text indistinguishable from human-written text. Previous work on
detecting AI-generated text has made effective progress, but has not involved
modern Chinese poetry. Due to the distinctive characteristics of modern Chinese
poetry, it is difficult to identify whether a poem originated from humans or
AI. The proliferation of AI-generated modern Chinese poetry has significantly
disrupted the poetry ecosystem. Based on the urgency of identifying
AI-generated poetry in the real Chinese world, this paper proposes a novel
benchmark for detecting LLMs-generated modern Chinese poetry. We first
construct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six
professional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs.
Subsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on
this dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that current detectors cannot be
used as reliable tools to detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs. The
most difficult poetic features to detect are intrinsic qualities, especially
style. The detection results verify the effectiveness and necessity of our
proposed benchmark. Our work lays a foundation for future detection of
AI-generated poetry.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TransGAT是一种结合微调Transformer和图注意力网络的新型自动作文评分方法，通过双流预测和句法依赖关系建模，在分析性评分维度上取得了优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工评分耗时且不一致，现有自动评分方法使用静态词嵌入无法捕捉上下文语义，且多采用整体评分而忽略了语法、词汇等具体写作维度。

Method: 提出TransGAT模型，将微调的Transformer（BERT、RoBERTa、DeBERTaV3）与图注意力网络配对，第一流生成文章级预测，第二流在Transformer词嵌入上应用GAT并基于句法依赖构建边，最后融合两流预测。

Result: 在ELLIPSE数据集上，TransGAT超越基线模型，在所有分析性评分维度上平均二次加权Kappa达到0.854。

Conclusion: TransGAT展示了结合Transformer上下文理解能力和GAT关系建模优势的潜力，能够有效推进自动作文评分系统的发展。

Abstract: Essay writing is a critical component of student assessment, yet manual
scoring is labor-intensive and inconsistent. Automated Essay Scoring (AES)
offers a promising alternative, but current approaches face limitations. Recent
studies have incorporated Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into AES using static
word embeddings that fail to capture contextual meaning, especially for
polysemous words. Additionally, many methods rely on holistic scoring,
overlooking specific writing aspects such as grammar, vocabulary, and cohesion.
To address these challenges, this study proposes TransGAT, a novel approach
that integrates fine-tuned Transformer models with GNNs for analytic scoring.
TransGAT combines the contextual understanding of Transformers with the
relational modeling strength of Graph Attention Networks (GAT). It performs
two-stream predictions by pairing each fine-tuned Transformer (BERT, RoBERTa,
and DeBERTaV3) with a separate GAT. In each pair, the first stream generates
essay-level predictions, while the second applies GAT to Transformer token
embeddings, with edges constructed from syntactic dependencies. The model then
fuses predictions from both streams to produce the final analytic score.
Experiments on the ELLIPSE dataset show that TransGAT outperforms baseline
models, achieving an average Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.854 across all
analytic scoring dimensions. These findings highlight the potential of TransGAT
to advance AES systems.

Motivation: 开发一种基于语音转录（发音）计算词语相似度的方法，以分析语言的语音结构，并能够高效处理大规模数据集。

Method: 使用Needleman-Wunsch算法计算词语语音相似度，用Rust实现算法并在CPU和GPU（CUDA+cudarc库）上并行化，构建全连接图并通过聚类算法识别语音相似的词语组。

Result: 方法在分析语言语音结构方面表现出可行性和有效性，GPU实现带来显著性能提升，能够高效处理大规模数据集。

Conclusion: 提出的基于语音相似度的方法有效可行，可轻松扩展到其他语言的分析，为语言语音结构研究提供了有力工具。

Abstract: We present a method to calculate the similarity between words based on their
phonetic transcription (their pronunciation) using the Needleman-Wunsch
algorithm. We implement this algorithm in Rust and parallelize it on both CPU
and GPU to handle large datasets efficiently. The GPU implementation leverages
CUDA and the cudarc Rust library to achieve significant performance
improvements. We validate our approach by constructing a fully-connected graph
where nodes represent words and edges have weights according to the similarity
between the words. This graph is then analyzed using clustering algorithms to
identify groups of phonetically similar words. Our results demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in analyzing the phonetic
structure of languages. It might be easily expanded to other languages.

*Zhengjia Wang,Qiang Sheng,Danding Wang,Beizhe Hu,Juan Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图神经网络的意图-语义联合建模方法(InSide)用于假新闻检测，通过同时考虑新闻的语义特征和意图信号，解决了传统方法仅依赖表面语义模式的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的假新闻检测方法主要依赖语义线索（如情感词、文体特征等），但这些表面模式在动态环境中容易变化，导致检测性能有限。本文认为通过分析新闻意图可以更深入地理解欺骗背后的内在思想。

Method: 提出Graph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide)方法，将语义和意图信号重构为异构图结构，通过实体引导实现长距离上下文交互，采用粗到细的意图建模，并使用基于动态路径的图对齐策略实现信号间的有效消息传递。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，所提出的InSide方法相比最先进的方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 通过将新闻意图纳入假新闻检测，实现了语义和意图的联合建模，能够更有效地检测假新闻，特别是在动态演变的新闻环境中表现出更好的性能。

Abstract: Fake news detection is an important and challenging task for defending online
information integrity. Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract
news semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words,
stylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues
can easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in
dynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news
landscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective
by incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and
semantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one
can deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than
the surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose
Graph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection,
which models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via
graph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and
intent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context
interaction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and
implementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling. To achieve
better alignment between semantics and intents, we further develop a dynamic
pathway-based graph alignment strategy for effective message passing and
aggregation across these signals by establishing a common space. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed InSide compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了chDzDT，一个针对阿尔及利亚方言形态特征的字符级预训练语言模型，通过处理孤立单词而非传统token序列来更好地处理该方言的复杂形态和代码转换问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔及利亚方言在自然语言处理中代表性不足，其复杂的形态、频繁的代码转换、多文字系统和强词汇影响使得传统词级或子词级方法效果有限。

Method: 开发字符级预训练模型chDzDT，在孤立单词上进行训练，使用来自YouTube评论、多语言维基百科和Tatoeba项目的多样化语料库，涵盖多种文字和语言变体。

Result: 构建了阿尔及利亚方言的多语言词典数据集，开发了专注于形态学的字符级编码器，为下游任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Conclusion: 字符级建模对于形态丰富、资源稀缺的方言具有巨大潜力，为构建更具包容性和适应性的NLP系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have substantially advanced natural
language processing by providing context-sensitive text representations.
However, the Algerian dialect remains under-represented, with few dedicated
models available. Processing this dialect is challenging due to its complex
morphology, frequent code-switching, multiple scripts, and strong lexical
influences from other languages. These characteristics complicate tokenization
and reduce the effectiveness of conventional word- or subword-level approaches.
  To address this gap, we introduce chDzDT, a character-level pre-trained
language model tailored for Algerian morphology. Unlike conventional PLMs that
rely on token sequences, chDzDT is trained on isolated words. This design
allows the model to encode morphological patterns robustly, without depending
on token boundaries or standardized orthography. The training corpus draws from
diverse sources, including YouTube comments, French, English, and Berber
Wikipedia, as well as the Tatoeba project. It covers multiple scripts and
linguistic varieties, resulting in a substantial pre-training workload.
  Our contributions are threefold: (i) a detailed morphological analysis of
Algerian dialect using YouTube comments; (ii) the construction of a
multilingual Algerian lexicon dataset; and (iii) the development and extensive
evaluation of a character-level PLM as a morphology-focused encoder for
downstream tasks. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential of
character-level modeling for morphologically rich, low-resource dialects and
lays a foundation for more inclusive and adaptable NLP systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现提示词敏感性更多是评估方法的人为产物而非LLM固有缺陷，使用LLM作为评判者能显著降低性能方差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视广泛报道的提示词敏感性是否是LLM的固有弱点，还是评估过程的人为产物

Method: 系统评估7个LLM在6个基准测试上的表现，使用12个不同提示模板，对比启发式评估和LLM-as-a-Judge方法

Result: 使用LLM作为评判者时观察到性能方差大幅降低，模型排名相关性显著提高

Conclusion: 现代LLM对提示模板的鲁棒性比之前认为的更强，提示词敏感性更多是评估方法的问题而非模型缺陷

Abstract: Prompt sensitivity, referring to the phenomenon where paraphrasing (i.e.,
repeating something written or spoken using different words) leads to
significant changes in large language model (LLM) performance, has been widely
accepted as a core limitation of LLMs. In this work, we revisit this issue and
ask: Is the widely reported high prompt sensitivity truly an inherent weakness
of LLMs, or is it largely an artifact of evaluation processes? To answer this
question, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family)
across 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12
diverse prompt templates. We find that much of the prompt sensitivity stems
from heuristic evaluation methods, including log-likelihood scoring and rigid
answer matching, which often overlook semantically correct responses expressed
through alternative phrasings, such as synonyms or paraphrases. When we adopt
LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance
variance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across
prompts. Our findings suggest that modern LLMs are more robust to prompt
templates than previously believed, and that prompt sensitivity may be more an
artifact of evaluation than a flaw in the models.

Method: 通过两个维度评估AI访谈系统：输入/输出性能（语音识别、答案记录、情感处理）和语言推理能力（探询、清楚化、分支逻辑处理），并进行实际场景研究。

Result: 实地研究显示AI访谈系统在数量和质性数据收集方面都超过了传统IVR系统，但存在实时转写错误率、有限的情感检测能力以及跟进质量不均等问题。

Conclusion: 当前AI访谈技术在质性数据收集中的应用效果受到上述限制的影响，其实际效用、使用和采纳可能需要根据具体情境考虑。

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for "AI
interviewers" that can administer voice-based surveys with respondents in
real-time. This position paper reviews emerging evidence to understand when
such AI interviewing systems are fit for purpose for collecting data within
quantitative and qualitative research contexts. We evaluate the capabilities of
AI interviewers as well as current Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems
across two dimensions: input/output performance (i.e., speech recognition,
answer recording, emotion handling) and verbal reasoning (i.e., ability to
probe, clarify, and handle branching logic). Field studies suggest that AI
interviewers already exceed IVR capabilities for both quantitative and
qualitative data collection, but real-time transcription error rates, limited
emotion detection abilities, and uneven follow-up quality indicate that the
utility, use and adoption of current AI interviewer technology may be
context-dependent for qualitative data collection efforts.

Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHRs)数据复杂且非结构化，传统机器学习方法难以有效提取关键患者信息，临床医生难以有效利用这些工具进行患者护理。

Method: 将任务从序列标注重构为文本生成，利用大型语言模型(LLMs)提供类似医生认知过程的推理步骤，并整合BERT Score等语义相似度指标来改进命名实体识别评估方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过增强可解释性和适应性，改善了临床决策支持，有助于提升患者护理效果，是医疗AI领域的重要进展。

Abstract: The extraction of critical patient information from Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) poses significant challenges due to the complexity and unstructured
nature of the data. Traditional machine learning approaches often fail to
capture pertinent details efficiently, making it difficult for clinicians to
utilize these tools effectively in patient care. This paper introduces a novel
approach to extracting the OPQRST assessment from EHRs by leveraging the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose to reframe the task
from sequence labeling to text generation, enabling the models to provide
reasoning steps that mimic a physician's cognitive processes. This approach
enhances interpretability and adapts to the limited availability of labeled
data in healthcare settings. Furthermore, we address the challenge of
evaluating the accuracy of machine-generated text in clinical contexts by
proposing a modification to traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) metrics.
This includes the integration of semantic similarity measures, such as the BERT
Score, to assess the alignment between generated text and the clinical intent
of the original records. Our contributions demonstrate a significant
advancement in the use of AI in healthcare, offering a scalable solution that
improves the accuracy and usability of information extraction from EHRs,
thereby aiding clinicians in making more informed decisions and enhancing
patient care outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主诉记录存在多种录入方式和医学术语变体，难以在不同医疗机构间标准化，给医疗文本挖掘带来困难

Method: 采用分割匹配算法生成弱标注，然后训练基于BERT的模型来定位实体提及并将其链接到预定义本体

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在无人工标注的情况下优于先前方法

Conclusion: 弱监督实体提取和链接方法能够有效解决主诉记录的标准化问题

Abstract: A Chief complaint (CC) is the reason for the medical visit as stated in the
patient's own words. It helps medical professionals to quickly understand a
patient's situation, and also serves as a short summary for medical text
mining. However, chief complaint records often take a variety of entering
methods, resulting in a wide variation of medical notations, which makes it
difficult to standardize across different medical institutions for record
keeping or text mining. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised method to
automatically extract and link entities in chief complaints in the absence of
human annotation. We first adopt a split-and-match algorithm to produce weak
annotations, including entity mention spans and class labels, on 1.2 million
real-world de-identified and IRB approved chief complaint records. Then we
train a BERT-based model with generated weak labels to locate entity mentions
in chief complaint text and link them to a pre-defined ontology. We conducted
extensive experiments, and the results showed that our Weakly Supervised Entity
Extraction and Linking (\ours) method produced superior performance over
previous methods without any human annotation.

Motivation: 争议解决在各个领域普遍存在，传统方式依赖人类法官。本文旨在探索LLMs作为法官助手来提高争议解决效率和质量的潜力。

Method: 开发DRAssist系统，识别争议的关键结构元素(事实、争议点、论据等)，将非结构化争议描述转化为结构化摘要，使用多种提示策略让LLMs在三个层次上输出争议解决方案。

Result: 通过比较LLMs与相关基线模型在使用合适评估指标的表现，评估了LLMs在争议解决任务中的性能。

Conclusion: LLMs有潜力作为人类法官的有效助手，在争议解决过程中提供结构化分析和多层次的决策支持，特别是在特定领域如汽车保险和域名争议中。

Abstract: Disputes between two parties occur in almost all domains such as taxation,
insurance, banking, healthcare, etc. The disputes are generally resolved in a
specific forum (e.g., consumer court) where facts are presented, points of
disagreement are discussed, arguments as well as specific demands of the
parties are heard, and finally a human judge resolves the dispute by often
favouring one of the two parties. In this paper, we explore the use of large
language models (LLMs) as assistants for the human judge to resolve such
disputes, as part of our DRAssist system. We focus on disputes from two
specific domains -- automobile insurance and domain name disputes. DRAssist
identifies certain key structural elements (e.g., facts, aspects or
disagreement, arguments) of the disputes and summarizes the unstructured
dispute descriptions to produce a structured summary for each dispute. We then
explore multiple prompting strategies with multiple LLMs for their ability to
assist in resolving the disputes in these domains. In DRAssist, these LLMs are
prompted to produce the resolution output at three different levels -- (i)
identifying an overall stronger party in a dispute, (ii) decide whether each
specific demand of each contesting party can be accepted or not, (iii) evaluate
whether each argument by each contesting party is strong or weak. We evaluate
the performance of LLMs on all these tasks by comparing them with relevant
baselines using suitable evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: StructCoh是一个结合图结构和对比学习的语义匹配框架，通过双图编码器和分层对比目标，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型虽然擅长捕捉token级交互，但往往忽略层次结构模式，在细微语义区分方面存在困难。需要同时理解结构关系和细粒度语义区别。

Method: 1) 双图编码器：通过依存句法分析和主题建模构建语义图，使用图同构网络传播结构特征；2) 分层对比目标：节点级对比正则化保持核心语义单元，图感知对比学习通过显式和隐式负采样策略对齐文档间结构语义。

Result: 在三个法律文档匹配基准和学术抄袭检测数据集上表现显著优于最先进方法，在法律法规匹配上达到86.7% F1分数（绝对提升6.2%），有效识别论证结构相似性。

Conclusion: StructCoh成功地将结构推理与表示空间优化相结合，通过图增强的对比学习框架有效解决了语义匹配中的结构模式和细微语义区分问题。

Abstract: Text semantic matching requires nuanced understanding of both structural
relationships and fine-grained semantic distinctions. While pre-trained
language models excel at capturing token-level interactions, they often
overlook hierarchical structural patterns and struggle with subtle semantic
discrimination. In this paper, we proposed StructCoh, a graph-enhanced
contrastive learning framework that synergistically combines structural
reasoning with representation space optimization. Our approach features two key
innovations: (1) A dual-graph encoder constructs semantic graphs via dependency
parsing and topic modeling, then employs graph isomorphism networks to
propagate structural features across syntactic dependencies and cross-document
concept nodes. (2) A hierarchical contrastive objective enforces consistency at
multiple granularities: node-level contrastive regularization preserves core
semantic units, while graph-aware contrastive learning aligns inter-document
structural semantics through both explicit and implicit negative sampling
strategies. Experiments on three legal document matching benchmarks and
academic plagiarism detection datasets demonstrate significant improvements
over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, StructCoh achieves 86.7% F1-score
(+6.2% absolute gain) on legal statute matching by effectively identifying
argument structure similarities.

Method: 使用34个标准化纵向牙周病例（包含258个问答对），通过开放式临床任务评估GPT-4o、Gemini 2.0 Flash、Copilot和DeepSeek V3四种模型的表现，采用自动化指标和执业牙医的盲法评估。

Result: DeepSeek表现最佳，显示出更高的忠实性（中位数得分0.528 vs. 0.367-0.457）和更高的专家评分（中位数4.5/5 vs. 4.0/5），且未显著影响可读性。

Conclusion: DeepSeek是案例分析的领先LLM，支持其作为辅助工具整合到医学教育和研究中，并突显其作为领域特定代理的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold transformative potential in healthcare, yet
their capacity to interpret longitudinal patient narratives remains
inadequately explored. Dentistry, with its rich repository of structured
clinical data, presents a unique opportunity to rigorously assess LLMs'
reasoning abilities. While several commercial LLMs already exist, DeepSeek, a
model that gained significant attention earlier this year, has also joined the
competition. This study evaluated four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini
2.0 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3) on their ability to analyze longitudinal
dental case vignettes through open-ended clinical tasks. Using 34 standardized
longitudinal periodontal cases (comprising 258 question-answer pairs), we
assessed model performance via automated metrics and blinded evaluations by
licensed dentists. DeepSeek emerged as the top performer, demonstrating
superior faithfulness (median score = 0.528 vs. 0.367-0.457) and higher expert
ratings (median = 4.5/5 vs. 4.0/5), without significantly compromising
readability. Our study positions DeepSeek as the leading LLM for case analysis,
endorses its integration as an adjunct tool in both medical education and
research, and highlights its potential as a domain-specific agent.

TL;DR: Genetic Prompt是一个结合遗传算法和LLM的框架，通过将文本语义属性视为基因序列，利用LLM模拟交叉和变异操作来增强合成数据生成的质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成合成数据方面表现出色，但确保其质量和多样性仍然具有挑战性。需要一种方法来产生更接近真实世界数据分布的合成数据。

Method: 将语义文本属性视为基因序列，利用LLM模拟遗传算法中的交叉和变异操作。集成主动学习方案来优化父代选择，扩展后代搜索空间。

Result: 在多个NLP任务上的实验表明：Genetic Prompt显著优于最先进的基线方法，在不同规模的生成模型上都表现出鲁棒性能。将合成数据与原始训练集融合能显著提升下游模型性能，特别是在类别不平衡场景中。

Conclusion: Genetic Prompt是生产高质量合成数据的有效方法，适用于广泛的NLP应用场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating synthetic data, but ensuring
its quality and diversity remains challenging. We propose Genetic Prompt, a
novel framework that combines genetic algorithms with LLMs to augment synthetic
data generation. Our approach treats semantic text attributes as gene sequences
and leverages the LLM to simulate crossover and mutation operations. This
genetic process enhances data quality and diversity by creating novel attribute
combinations, yielding synthetic distributions closer to real-world data. To
optimize parent selection, we also integrate an active learning scheme that
expands the offspring search space. Our experiments on multiple NLP tasks
reveal several key findings: Genetic Prompt not only significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines but also shows robust performance across various
generator model sizes and scales. Moreover, we demonstrate that fusing our
synthetic data with the original training set significantly boosts downstream
model performance, particularly for class-imbalanced scenarios. Our findings
validate that Genetic Prompt is an effective method for producing high-quality
synthetic data for a wide range of NLP applications.

Motivation: 研究基础模型与指令微调模型在英语和意大利语长度控制文本生成中的性能差异

Method: 使用积累加权归因法(Cumulative Weighted Attribution)分析模型内部组件贡献，详细观察注意力机制和MLP层的作用

Result: 指令微调在英语中通过深层注意力机制提升性能，在意大利语中则依靠最后层MLP层补偿注意力机制的不足

Conclusion: 指令微调重新配置模型后期层以遵循任务要求，组件级别策略可能随语言环境而调整

Abstract: Adhering to explicit length constraints, such as generating text with a
precise word count, remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). This study aims at investigating the differences between foundation
models and their instruction-tuned counterparts, on length-controlled text
generation in English and Italian. We analyze both performance and internal
component contributions using Cumulative Weighted Attribution, a metric derived
from Direct Logit Attribution. Our findings reveal that instruction-tuning
substantially improves length control, primarily by specializing components in
deeper model layers. Specifically, attention heads in later layers of IT models
show increasingly positive contributions, particularly in English. In Italian,
while attention contributions are more attenuated, final-layer MLPs exhibit a
stronger positive role, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. These results
indicate that instruction-tuning reconfigures later layers for task adherence,
with component-level strategies potentially adapting to linguistic context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法主要关注直接提示精炼或模型微调，忽略了利用LLM固有推理能力从对比示例中学习的潜力。

Method: 从HelpSteer2数据集中检索top k参考提示，构建两种对比推理范式：分层对比推理（比较高、中、低质量提示）和多指标对比推理（分析各评估维度的最佳提示）。

Result: 在HelpSteer2基准测试中，CRPO显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 对比性、检索增强的推理方法在自动提示优化方面具有巨大潜力，能够实现更鲁棒和可解释的优化。

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization has recently emerged as a strategy for
improving the quality of prompts used in Large Language Models (LLMs), with the
goal of generating more accurate and useful responses. However, most prior work
focuses on direct prompt refinement or model fine-tuning, overlooking the
potential of leveraging LLMs' inherent reasoning capability to learn from
contrasting examples. In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt
Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a
retrieval augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference
prompts from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open-source collection annotated for
helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, and constructs
two complementary optimization paradigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning,
where the LLM compares high, medium, and low quality prompts to refine its own
generation through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive
reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best prompts along each evaluation
dimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By
explicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model
to deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more
robust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2
benchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines. Our
findings highlight the promise of contrastive, retrieval-augmented reasoning
for advancing automatic prompt optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型评估基于预定义问题集的范式存在与目标交互有限、难度控制不足、评估结果有效性验证困难等挑战，难以精确确定目标模型的知识和能力边界。

Method: 提出JudgeAgent框架，采用知识驱动的数据合成和目标自适应难度调整方法，通过基准评分、交互扩展和评估反馈三个步骤进行扩展测试。

Result: 通过大量实验证明了JudgeAgent及其动态评估范式的有效性，提供了准确有效的评估结果。

Conclusion: JudgeAgent框架能够更精确地评估大型语言模型的知识和能力边界，为LLM评估提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is an essential
step to ensure the successful application of LLMs across various domains. The
current evaluation of LLMs is based on a paradigm that involves querying them
with predefined question sets and assessing their outputs. This paradigm offers
controllable processes and simplicity, but faces challenges such as limited
interaction with targets, insufficient difficulty control, and difficulties in
verifying the validity of evaluation results, making it hard to precisely
determine the knowledge and capability boundaries of target models. To address
these challenges, we propose JudgeAgent, a knowledge-target adaptive dynamic
evaluation framework based on a new interviewer-style evaluation paradigm.
JudgeAgent employs a comprehensive evaluation approach consisting of benchmark
grading, interactive extension, and evaluation feedback. It utilizes
knowledge-driven data synthesis and target-adaptive difficulty adjustment
methods to conduct extended testing, providing accurate and effective
evaluation results. We also introduce a novel insight into validating
evaluation methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of JudgeAgent and its
dynamic evaluation paradigm through extensive experiments.

*Wang Chen,Guanqiang Qi,Weikang Li,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于共模态的检索增强生成方法(CMRAG)，能够同时利用文本和图像信息进行高效检索和生成，显著提升了多模态文档问答任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成方法在处理多模态文档时存在局限性：基于布局分析和文本提取的方法无法处理图像内容，而纯视觉方法则忽略了文本的语义优势。

Method: 首先对文档进行结构化解析获得文本段和图像区域的共模态表示，然后分别从文本和图像通道检索候选证据，在跨模态检索层面聚合结果，最后提示视觉语言模型基于共模态检索结果生成最终响应。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉文档问答任务中显著优于纯视觉基础的RAG方法。

Conclusion: 将共模态信息以统一方式整合到RAG框架中是提升复杂文档视觉问答系统性能的有效途径。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a core paradigm in document
question answering tasks. However, existing methods have limitations when
dealing with multimodal documents: one category of methods relies on layout
analysis and text extraction, which can only utilize explicit text information
and struggle to capture images or unstructured content; the other category
treats document segmentation as visual input and directly passes it to visual
language models (VLMs) for processing, yet it ignores the semantic advantages
of text, leading to suboptimal generation results. This paper proposes
co-modality-based RAG (CMRAG), which can simultaneously leverage text and
images for efficient retrieval and generation. Specifically, we first perform
structured parsing on documents to obtain co-modality representations of text
segments and image regions. Subsequently, in response to user queries, we
retrieve candidate evidence from text and image channels, respectively, and
aggregate the results at the cross-modal retrieval level. Finally, we prompt
the VLM to generate the final response based on the co-modality retrieval
results. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
pure-vision-based RAG in visual document question answering tasks. The findings
of this paper show that integrating co-modality information into the RAG
framework in a unified manner is an effective approach to improving the
performance of complex document visual question-answering (VQA) systems.

TL;DR: 提出了AMBEDKAR框架，通过宪法感知解码层和推测解码算法，在不修改基础模型参数的情况下，有效减少LLM在种姓和宗教方面的偏见，偏见减少达26.41%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型可能反映训练数据中的社会偏见，特别是在印度语境下，种姓和宗教偏见尤为突出。现有缓解策略多为西方中心化，无法解决本地化细微差别。

Method: 基于印度宪法第14-17条的平等愿景，设计宪法感知解码层，在推理时应用而不更新模型参数。采用推测解码算法，让小型语言模型作为潜在偏见生成器，大型语言模型作为宪法指导的验证器。

Result: 相比基线，偏见绝对减少高达26.41%。该方法无需重新训练，降低了计算和基础设施成本。

Conclusion: AMBEDKAR框架成功将推测解码重新解释为公平性机制而非效率工具，为LLM在印度语境下的偏见缓解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can inadvertently reflect societal biases
present in their training data, leading to harmful or prejudiced outputs. In
the Indian context, our empirical evaluations across a suite of models reveal
that biases around caste and religion are particularly salient. Yet, most
existing mitigation strategies are Western-centric and fail to address these
local nuances. We propose AMBEDKAR, a framework inspired by the egalitarian
vision of Dr B. R. Ambedkar, architect of the Indian Constitution, to guide LLM
outputs toward fairness, neutrality, and inclusion in line with Articles 14 to
17. Our approach introduces a Constitution-Aware Decoding Layer, guided by the
AI Constitution of India and applied only at inference time, without any
parameter updates to the base model. We incorporate a speculative decoding
algorithm that proactively reduces casteist and communal bias during
generation. This mitigation layer operates directly within the decoding
process, avoiding changes to model internals and lowering the computational and
infrastructural costs associated with retraining. We reinterpret speculative
decoding not merely as an efficiency tool but as a mechanism for fairness. In
this framework, a Small Language Model (SLM) acts as a potentially biased
generator, while a constitutionally guided Large Language Model (LLM) serves as
the verifier. Rather than accelerating generation, the LLM enforces bias-robust
trajectories in the SLM outputs. This inversion of roles gives rise to a
fairness-by-speculation paradigm. Our approach yields an absolute reduction of
bias up to 26.41 percent compared to baseline. Our source code, datasets, and
results are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AMBEDKAR-983B/

<details>

Motivation: 解决低资源语言NER任务中大型多语言模型内存和延迟约束的问题，探索小型解码器模型通过元学习实现快速适应和零样本迁移

Method: 用一阶模型无关元学习（MAML）替换部分自回归目标进行预训练，在Tagalog和Cebuano语言上进行测试

Result: MAML提升零样本micro-F1分数2-6个百分点（仅头部调优）和1-3个百分点（全调优），收敛时间减少最多8%

Conclusion: 元学习预训练能有效提升小型模型在低资源语言NER任务中的零样本性能，表面锚点（如Tagalog格助词）对实体识别很重要

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) in low-resource languages is usually tackled
by finetuning very large multilingual LMs, an option that is often infeasible
in memory- or latency-constrained settings. We ask whether small decoder LMs
can be pretrained so that they adapt quickly and transfer zero-shot to
languages unseen during pretraining. To this end we replace part of the
autoregressive objective with first-order model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML).
Tagalog and Cebuano are typologically similar yet structurally different in
their actor/non-actor voice systems, and hence serve as a challenging test-bed.
Across four model sizes (11 M - 570 M) MAML lifts zero-shot micro-F1 by 2-6 pp
under head-only tuning and 1-3 pp after full tuning, while cutting convergence
time by up to 8%. Gains are largest for single-token person entities that
co-occur with Tagalog case particles si/ni, highlighting the importance of
surface anchors.

TL;DR: 通过避免重复的解码策略，在保持语言质量的同时大幅提升大语言模型输出的创造性和多样性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在故事生成等任务中容易产生重复和单调的输出，缺乏创造性多样性

Method: 提出Avoidance Decoding方法，通过两个相似性罚分机制：概念层面罚分和叙事层面罚分，动态调整以优化创造性和语言质量

Result: 输出多样性提升2.6倍，重复率平均降低30%，同时激活更广泛的神经元显示模型内在创造力

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了LLM输出重复问题，在不影响语言质量的前提下大幅提升了创造性多样性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate repetitive and monotonous
outputs, especially in tasks like story generation, due to limited creative
diversity when given the same input prompt. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel decoding strategy, Avoidance Decoding, that modifies token
logits by penalizing similarity to previously generated outputs, thereby
encouraging more diverse multi-branch stories. This penalty adaptively balances
two similarity measures: (1) Concept-level Similarity Penalty, which is
prioritized in early stages to diversify initial story concepts, and (2)
Narrative-level Similarity Penalty, which is increasingly emphasized later to
ensure natural yet diverse plot development. Notably, our method achieves up to
2.6 times higher output diversity and reduces repetition by an average of 30%
compared to strong baselines, while effectively mitigating text degeneration.
Furthermore, we reveal that our method activates a broader range of neurons,
demonstrating that it leverages the model's intrinsic creativity.

Conclusion: FActBench为医学领域提供了有效的事实核查基准，一致投票方法能够可靠地评估LLM的事实准确性

Abstract: Large Language Models tend to struggle when dealing with specialized domains.
While all aspects of evaluation hold importance, factuality is the most
critical one. Similarly, reliable fact-checking tools and data sources are
essential for hallucination mitigation. We address these issues by providing a
comprehensive Fact-checking Benchmark FActBench covering four generation tasks

We use two state-of-the-art Fact-checking techniques: Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

fact-checking scores acquired through the Unanimous Voting of both techniques
correlate best with Domain Expert Evaluation.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型的幻觉、偏见、隐私和高计算成本问题，这些问题的根源在于将语言能力和事实记忆结合在单一模型中。

Method: 评估135M到32B参数规模的模型在三个维度上的表现：语言能力、外部事实知识和内部事实知识，分析规模扩展对各项能力的影响。

Result: 研究发现语言能力和事实知识都随规模增长而提升，但内部事实知识增长更快，表明模型规模与记忆能力的关系比与核心语言能力的关系更密切。

Conclusion: 支持模块化语言建模方法，使用紧凑的语言能力强的模型作为工具增强系统的基础，提供更高效、可解释和可持续的NLP解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models offer impressive language capabilities but suffer from
well-known limitations, including hallucinations, biases, privacy concerns, and
high computational costs. These issues are largely driven by the combination of
linguistic competence and factual memorization within a single monolithic
model. This paper introduces and empirically supports the Fundamental Language
Model (FLM) paradigm, which advocates for smaller, linguistically competent
models that offload factual retrieval to external tools. We evaluate models
ranging from 135M to 32B parameters across three dimensions: linguistic
competence, external factual knowledge, and internal factual knowledge. Our
findings reveal that while both linguistic competence and factual knowledge
improve with scale, internal factual knowledge grows significantly faster,
suggesting that model size is more closely tied to memorization than to core
language ability. These results support a modular approach to language
modeling, where compact, linguistically proficient models serve as the
foundation for tool-augmented systems. The FLM paradigm offers a path toward
more efficient, interpretable, and sustainable NLP solutions.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型是否能够不仅推断人类思维模式，还能揭示团队对话中的盲点，特别是团队成员在共同理解方面的差异。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用LLM对CReST语料库中的任务导向对话进行SMM元素标注；第二阶段使用另一个LLM比较LLM标注与人工标注，检测差异并定义SMM一致性评估框架。

Result: LLM在简单自然语言标注任务中表现出明显的一致性，但在需要空间推理或韵律线索消歧的场景中会系统性出错。生成了人工和LLM标注数据集、可复现的SMM一致性评估框架以及基于LLM的差异检测实证评估。

Conclusion: 虽然LLM在某些标注任务中表现良好，但在复杂推理场景中存在局限性，需要进一步改进以准确捕捉团队对话中的细微差异。

Abstract: What if large language models could not only infer human mindsets but also
expose every blind spot in team dialogue such as discrepancies in the team
members' joint understanding? We present a novel, two-step framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) both as human-style annotators of team
dialogues to track the team's shared mental models (SMMs) and as automated
discrepancy detectors among individuals' mental states. In the first step, an
LLM generates annotations by identifying SMM elements within task-oriented
dialogues from the Cooperative Remote Search Task (CReST) corpus. Then, a
secondary LLM compares these LLM-derived annotations and human annotations
against gold-standard labels to detect and characterize divergences. We define
an SMM coherence evaluation framework for this use case and apply it to six
CReST dialogues, ultimately producing: (1) a dataset of human and LLM
annotations; (2) a reproducible evaluation framework for SMM coherence; and (3)
an empirical assessment of LLM-based discrepancy detection. Our results reveal
that, although LLMs exhibit apparent coherence on straightforward
natural-language annotation tasks, they systematically err in scenarios
requiring spatial reasoning or disambiguation of prosodic cues.

TL;DR: DCPO提出动态剪切策略和平滑优势标准化技术，解决RLVR中的零梯度问题，在多个模型和测试集上达到最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法如GRPO存在零梯度问题，主要由于固定剪切边界和契约奖励标准化导致的无效梯度更新和生成响应利用不充分。

Method: 提出DCPO方法：1)动态剪切策略，根据标记特定先验概率自适应调整剪切边界以增强标记级探索；2)平滑优势标准化技术，在累积训练步骤上标准化奖励以提高响应级利用效率。

Result: 在四个模型的四个测试集上达到最佳性能：AIME24标准化下Avg@1 46.7，Avg@32 38.8；AIME25标准化下23.3/19.0。非零优势比GRPO提高28%，训练效率比DAPO提高一倍，标记剪切比例明显降低。

Conclusion: DCPO能够更有效地利用生成数据进行强化学习，通过动态剪切和优势标准化技术有效解决了零梯度问题，在大语言模型的推理能力提升方面取得显著成效。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero
gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for
token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards,
which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of
generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy
Optimization (DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that
adaptively adjusts the clipping bounds based on token-specific prior
probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage
standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training
steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated
responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based
on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under
greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24
benchmark, surpassing both DAPO (36.7/31.6) and GRPO (36.7/32.1) on the
Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO
achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5) and DAPO
(20.0/15.3). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the
nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency
over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of
magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance.
These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across a
wide range of tasks. Reasoning with LLMs is central to solving multi-step
problems and complex decision-making. To support efficient reasoning, recent
studies have shifted attention from explicit chain-of-thought prompting toward
implicit reasoning, where reasoning occurs silently via latent structures
without emitting intermediate textual steps. Implicit reasoning brings
advantages such as lower generation cost, faster inference, and better
alignment with internal computation. Although prior surveys have discussed
latent representations in the context of reasoning, a dedicated and
mechanism-level examination of how reasoning unfolds internally within LLMs
remains absent. This survey fills that gap by introducing a taxonomy centered
on execution paradigms, shifting the focus from representational forms to
computational strategies. We organize existing methods into three execution
paradigms based on \textbf{\textit{how and where internal computation
unfolds}}: latent optimization, signal-guided control, and layer-recurrent
execution. We also review structural, behavioral and representation-based
evidence that supports the presence of implicit reasoning in LLMs. We further
provide a structured overview of the evaluation metrics and benchmarks used in
existing works to assess the effectiveness and reliability of implicit
reasoning.We maintain a continuously updated project at:

Abstract: We propose a scalable method for constructing a temporal opinion knowledge
base with large language models (LLMs) as automated annotators. Despite the
demonstrated utility of time-series opinion analysis of text for downstream
applications such as forecasting and trend analysis, existing methodologies
underexploit this potential due to the absence of temporally grounded
fine-grained annotations. Our approach addresses this gap by integrating
well-established opinion mining formulations into a declarative LLM annotation
pipeline, enabling structured opinion extraction without manual prompt
engineering. We define three data models grounded in sentiment and opinion
mining literature, serving as schemas for structured representation. We perform
rigorous quantitative evaluation of our pipeline using human-annotated test
samples. We carry out the final annotations using two separate LLMs, and
inter-annotator agreement is computed label-wise across the fine-grained
opinion dimensions, analogous to human annotation protocols. The resulting
knowledge base encapsulates time-aligned, structured opinions and is compatible
with applications in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), temporal question
answering, and timeline summarisation.

Abstract: Social telehealth has made remarkable progress in healthcare by allowing
patients to post symptoms and participate in medical consultations remotely.
Users frequently post symptoms on social media and online health platforms,
creating a huge repository of medical data that can be leveraged for disease
classification. Large language models (LLMs) such as LLAMA3 and GPT-3.5, along
with transformer-based models like BERT, have demonstrated strong capabilities
in processing complex medical text. In this study, we evaluate three Arabic
medical text preprocessing methods such as summarization, refinement, and Named
Entity Recognition (NER) before applying fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
(CAMeLBERT, AraBERT, and AsafayaBERT). To enhance robustness, we adopt a
majority voting ensemble that combines predictions from original and
preprocessed text representations. This approach achieved the best
classification accuracy of 80.56%, thus showing its effectiveness in leveraging
various text representations and model predictions to improve the understanding
of medical texts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
integrates LLM-based preprocessing with fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
and ensemble learning for disease classification in Arabic social telehealth
data.

Abstract: Personality detection from text is commonly performed by analysing users'
social media posts. However, existing methods heavily rely on large-scale
annotated datasets, making it challenging to obtain high-quality personality
labels. Moreover, most studies treat emotion and personality as independent
variables, overlooking their interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel
self-supervised framework, EmoPerso, which improves personality detection
through emotion-aware modelling. EmoPerso first leverages generative mechanisms
for synthetic data augmentation and rich representation learning. It then
extracts pseudo-labeled emotion features and jointly optimizes them with
personality prediction via multi-task learning. A cross-attention module is
employed to capture fine-grained interactions between personality traits and
the inferred emotional representations. To further refine relational reasoning,
EmoPerso adopts a self-taught strategy to enhance the model's reasoning
capabilities iteratively. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets
demonstrate that EmoPerso surpasses state-of-the-art models. The source code is

TL;DR: 研究表明，大语言模型在处理任务时并不总是有效整合外部标签定义，而是经常依赖内部参数化知识，特别是在通用任务中；领域特定任务更能从外部定义中受益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型是否真正整合外部定义，还是主要依赖其参数化知识，以理解模型如何处理外部知识与内部能力的关系。

Method: 在多个解释基准数据集（通用和领域特定）上进行受控实验，测试不同标签定义条件（专家策划、LLM生成、扰动和交换定义）的影响。

Result: 显式标签定义可以提高准确性和可解释性，但模型整合这些定义到任务解决过程中并不保证或一致，表明在许多情况下依赖内部表示；通用任务中模型更倾向于使用内部表示，而领域特定任务更能从显式定义中受益。

Conclusion: 需要更深入理解大语言模型如何处理外部知识与其预训练能力的关系，模型对外部定义的整合具有不一致性。

Abstract: Do LLMs genuinely incorporate external definitions, or do they primarily rely
on their parametric knowledge? To address these questions, we conduct
controlled experiments across multiple explanation benchmark datasets (general
and domain-specific) and label definition conditions, including expert-curated,
LLM-generated, perturbed, and swapped definitions. Our results reveal that
while explicit label definitions can enhance accuracy and explainability, their
integration into an LLM's task-solving processes is neither guaranteed nor
consistent, suggesting reliance on internalized representations in many cases.
Models often default to their internal representations, particularly in general
tasks, whereas domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions.
These findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how LLMs
process external knowledge alongside their pre-existing capabilities.

Motivation: 基础模型提供商发布了行为准则承诺，但缺乏系统性的审计来验证模型是否真正遵循这些规范

Method: 通过解析行为声明、生成针对性提示、使用模型作为评判者，建立提供商规范-模型输出-模型评判者三者一致性的审计框架

Result: 对6个开发商的16个模型进行了100多项行为声明审计，发现系统性不一致问题，提供商间合规差距最高达20%

Conclusion: 基础模型在满足开发者行为规范方面存在显著的不一致性，需要建立更严格的合规验证机制

Abstract: Companies that develop foundation models publish behavioral guidelines they
pledge their models will follow, but it remains unclear if models actually do
so. While providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have published
detailed specifications describing both desired safety constraints and
qualitative traits for their models, there has been no systematic audit of
adherence to these guidelines. We introduce an automated framework that audits
models against their providers specifications by parsing behavioral statements,
generating targeted prompts, and using models to judge adherence. Our central
focus is on three way consistency between a provider specification, its model
outputs, and its own models as judges; an extension of prior two way generator
validator consistency. This establishes a necessary baseline: at minimum, a
foundation model should consistently satisfy the developer behavioral
specifications when judged by the developer evaluator models. We apply our
framework to 16 models from six developers across more than 100 behavioral
statements, finding systematic inconsistencies including compliance gaps of up
to 20 percent across providers.

Motivation: 现有奖励模型严重依赖大规模标注偏好数据，而现有预训练方法无法在奖励模型中注入显式推理能力，需要解决这一关键挑战

Method: 采用自训练方法利用无标注数据激发奖励推理，开发GRAM-R²生成式奖励模型，同时生成偏好标签和奖励理由

Result: 在响应排序、任务适应和人类反馈强化学习等实验中，GRAM-R² consistently outperforms discriminative and generative baselines

Conclusion: GRAM-R²可作为奖励推理的基础模型，支持响应排序和任务特定奖励调优等下游应用，具有广泛适用性

Abstract: Significant progress in reward modeling over recent years has been driven by
a paradigm shift from task-specific designs towards generalist reward models.
Despite this trend, developing effective reward models remains a fundamental
challenge: the heavy reliance on large-scale labeled preference data.
Pre-training on abundant unlabeled data offers a promising direction, but
existing approaches fall short of instilling explicit reasoning into reward
models. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-training approach that leverages
unlabeled data to elicit reward reasoning in reward models. Based on this
approach, we develop GRAM-R$^2$, a generative reward model trained to produce
not only preference labels but also accompanying reward rationales. GRAM-R$^2$
can serve as a foundation model for reward reasoning and can be applied to a
wide range of tasks with minimal or no additional fine-tuning. It can support
downstream applications such as response ranking and task-specific reward
tuning. Experiments on response ranking, task adaptation, and reinforcement
learning from human feedback demonstrate that GRAM-R$^2$ consistently delivers
strong performance, outperforming several strong discriminative and generative
baselines.

Method: 构建包含风格参考库(SRR)、风格感知路由器(SAR)和条件阈值估计器(CTE)的MoSEs框架，动态统计语言特征并确定最优阈值

Result: 平均检测性能提升11.34%，在少量数据情况下提升达39.15%

Conclusion: MoSEs框架通过风格感知的不确定性量化，显著提升了AI生成文本检测的可靠性和性能

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has intensified public
concerns about the potential misuse. Therefore, it is important to build
trustworthy AI-generated text detection systems. Existing methods neglect
stylistic modeling and mostly rely on static thresholds, which greatly limits
the detection performance. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of Stylistic
Experts (MoSEs) framework that enables stylistics-aware uncertainty
quantification through conditional threshold estimation. MoSEs contain three
core components, namely, the Stylistics Reference Repository (SRR), the
Stylistics-Aware Router (SAR), and the Conditional Threshold Estimator (CTE).
For input text, SRR can activate the appropriate reference data in SRR and
provide them to CTE. Subsequently, CTE jointly models the linguistic
statistical properties and semantic features to dynamically determine the
optimal threshold. With a discrimination score, MoSEs yields prediction labels
with the corresponding confidence level. Our framework achieves an average
improvement 11.34% in detection performance compared to baselines. More
inspiringly, MoSEs shows a more evident improvement 39.15% in the low-resource
case. Our code is available at https://github.com/creator-xi/MoSEs.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言中语义评估的挑战，因为当前缺乏高质量的印地语言语义理解测试数据集。

Method: 构建包含10种印地语言的新闻标题识别数据集，每个语言包含20,000条新闻文章和四种标题变体（原始、语义相似、词汇相似、无关），使用余弦相似度测试句子编码器的性能。

Abstract: Semantic evaluation in low-resource languages remains a major challenge in
NLP. While sentence transformers have shown strong performance in high-resource
settings, their effectiveness in Indic languages is underexplored due to a lack
of high-quality benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce
L3Cube-IndicHeadline-ID, a curated headline identification dataset spanning ten
low-resource Indic languages: Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Gujarati, Odia, Kannada,
Malayalam, Punjabi, Telugu, Bengali and English. Each language includes 20,000
news articles paired with four headline variants: the original, a semantically
similar version, a lexically similar version, and an unrelated one, designed to
test fine-grained semantic understanding. The task requires selecting the
correct headline from the options using article-headline similarity. We
benchmark several sentence transformers, including multilingual and
language-specific models, using cosine similarity. Results show that
multilingual models consistently perform well, while language-specific models
vary in effectiveness. Given the rising use of similarity models in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, this dataset also serves as a
valuable resource for evaluating and improving semantic understanding in such
applications. Additionally, the dataset can be repurposed for multiple-choice
question answering, headline classification, or other task-specific evaluations
of LLMs, making it a versatile benchmark for Indic NLP. The dataset is shared

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新发现和验证Federico Pucci在1929年提出的机械翻译系统，这一早期机器翻译先驱的工作几乎被完全遗忘，通过现代AI技术证明其方法的有效性并恢复其历史地位。

Method: 使用AI按照Pucci在1931年书中描述的方法，重新翻译他当年处理过的但丁《新生》和伏尔泰《查第格》文本片段，然后扩展到英语、西班牙语和德语的翻译。

Result: AI按照Pucci方法翻译的结果与94年前的原作相比差异很小，验证了该系统的有效性。进一步成功应用于现代技术文本的翻译。

Conclusion: Pucci的机械翻译系统经AI验证有效，应被重新认定为机器翻译领域的早期先驱，与Troyanskij、Booth和Weaver等知名先驱并列，可能改写机器翻译领域的历史认知。

Abstract: A pioneering rule-based mechanical translation system (precursor of modern
RBMTs) was first presented in December 1929 by its inventor, Federico Pucci,
who later published the full method in a book titled "Il traduttore meccanico
ed il metodo per corrispondersi fra Europei conoscendo ciascuno solo la propria
lingua: Parte I", in Salerno (Italy), in 1931. This study illustrates how AI
breathes new life into the system of international keys and ideograms devised
by Pucci to translate from/into any Romance language (at least as a first
step). The methodology involves having the AIs retranslate, following Pucci's
method, the two text excerpts originally translated in 1931 and clearly
documented in his publication: a passage from Dante's La Vita Nuova, translated
from Italian into French, and a passage from Voltaire's Zadig, translated from
French into Italian. The result is notable: the two texts, translated 94 years
apart using the same method--by Pucci in 1931 and by AIs in 2025--show a low
average difference, with only minor variations observed. With Pucci's system
thus validated, it became feasible to have the AIs reproduce the excerpts in
English, Spanish, and German according to his method. The results were
consistent, and Pucci--via Artificial Intelligence--was tasked with translating
more modern and technical texts, thereby reviving, nearly a century later, an
invention that had remained almost entirely unknown and never applied beyond
its creator, now brought to wider attention and opened to possible
experimentation. Such a demonstration would not only affirm Pucci's historical
status but also place him among the precursors and intellectual contributors to
machine translation, whose work merits examination alongside figures such as
Troyanskij, Booth, and Weaver, with possible consequences for how the history
of the field is understood.

Motivation: 现有截断采样技术（温度缩放、top-p、min-p采样）在有效融入模型置信度方面存在局限，特别是min-p采样仅依赖单个顶部token作为置信度启发式方法，未能充分利用概率分布信息

Method: 建立熵约束最小散度问题的理论框架，证明其等价于NP难的熵约束质量最大化问题，提出计算高效的贪心算法top-H解码来解决该问题

Result: 在创意写作基准上比min-p采样提升25.63%，在GPQA、GSM8K和MT-Bench等问答数据集上保持鲁棒性，LLM-as-judge评估证实即使在高温度下也能产生连贯输出

Conclusion: top-H推进了开放文本生成的最新技术，可轻松集成到创意写作应用中，有效平衡了创造性与连贯性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance across a
wide range of tasks, often struggle to balance two competing objectives in
open-ended text generation: fostering diversity and creativity while preserving
logical coherence. Existing truncated sampling techniques, including
temperature scaling, top-\$p\$ (nucleus) sampling, and min-\$p\$ sampling, aim
to manage this trade-off. However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in
the effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the
corresponding sampling strategy. For example, min-\$p\$ sampling relies on a
single top token as a heuristic for confidence, eventually underutilizing the
information of the probability distribution. Toward effective incorporation of
the confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We
first establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity
and coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained
minimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be
equivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem,
which is NP-hard. Finally, we present top-H decoding, a computationally
efficient greedy algorithm to solve the ECMM problem. Extensive empirical
evaluations demonstrate that top-H outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA)
alternative of min-\$p\$ sampling by up to **25.63%** on creative writing
benchmarks, while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets such as
GPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. Additionally, an *LLM-as-judge* evaluation confirms
that top-H indeed produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures, where
creativity is especially critical. In summary, top-H advances SoTA in
open-ended text generation and can be *easily integrated* into creative writing
applications. The code is available at
https://github.com/ErfanBaghaei/Top-H-Decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码混合文本（特别是印地语-英语混合的Hinglish）的命名实体识别面临独特挑战，包括非正式结构、音译和频繁语言切换，需要评估不同模型在此任务上的表现。

Method: 比较评估了代码混合微调模型（HingBERT、HingMBERT、HingRoBERTa）、非代码混合多语言模型（BERT Base Cased、IndicBERT、RoBERTa、MuRIL）以及零样本生成式大语言模型（Google Gemini），使用精确率、召回率和F1分数在基准Hinglish NER数据集上进行测试。

Result: 代码混合模型（特别是HingRoBERTa和HingBERT）表现最佳，优于包括闭源LLMs在内的其他模型；非代码混合模型表现尚可但适应性有限；Google Gemini在零样本设置下展现出有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 专业化的代码混合微调模型在代码混合NER任务中效果最好，但现代LLMs在零样本设置下也显示出强大的泛化能力，为专用模型与通用模型的选择提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in code-mixed text, particularly Hindi-English
(Hinglish), presents unique challenges due to informal structure,
transliteration, and frequent language switching. This study conducts a
comparative evaluation of code-mixed fine-tuned models and non-code-mixed
multilingual models, along with zero-shot generative large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, we evaluate HingBERT, HingMBERT, and HingRoBERTa (trained
on code-mixed data), and BERT Base Cased, IndicBERT, RoBERTa and MuRIL (trained
on non-code-mixed multilingual data). We also assess the performance of Google
Gemini in a zero-shot setting using a modified version of the dataset with NER
tags removed. All models are tested on a benchmark Hinglish NER dataset using
Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Results show that code-mixed models,
particularly HingRoBERTa and HingBERT-based fine-tuned models, outperform
others - including closed-source LLMs like Google Gemini - due to
domain-specific pretraining. Non-code-mixed models perform reasonably but show
limited adaptability. Notably, Google Gemini exhibits competitive zero-shot
performance, underlining the generalization strength of modern LLMs. This study
provides key insights into the effectiveness of specialized versus generalized
models for code-mixed NER tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have
empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle challenging reasoning tasks
such as mathematics and programming. RLVR leverages verifiable outcome rewards
to guide policy optimization, enabling LLMs to progressively improve output
quality in a grounded and reliable manner. Despite its promise, the RLVR
paradigm poses significant challenges, as existing methods often suffer from
sparse reward signals and unstable policy gradient updates, particularly in
RL-based approaches. To address the challenges, we propose $\textbf{PACS}$, a
novel RLVR framework that achieves im$\textbf{P}$licit $\textbf{A}$ctor
$\textbf{C}$ritic coupling via a $\textbf{S}$upervised learning framework. By
treating the outcome reward as a predictable label, we reformulate the RLVR
problem into a supervised learning task over a score function parameterized by
the policy model and optimized using cross-entropy loss. A detailed gradient
analysis shows that this supervised formulation inherently recovers the
classical policy gradient update while implicitly coupling actor and critic
roles, yielding more stable and efficient training. Benchmarking on challenging
mathematical reasoning tasks, PACS outperforms strong RLVR baselines, such as
PPO and GRPO, achieving superior reasoning performance. For instance, PACS
achieves 59.78\% at pass@256 on AIME 2025, representing improvements of 13.32

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Flavors of Moonshine是一系列专门为少数语言设计的小型语音识别模型，通过精心平衡的高质量数据训练，在27M参数规模下超越了多语言模型的表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战多语言ASR模型优于单语言模型的传统观念，为资源稀缺语言提供高质量的设备端语音识别解决方案

Method: 使用精心平衡的高质量人工标注、伪标注和合成数据训练单语言系统，模型规模为27M参数

Result: 平均错误率比同等规模的Whisper Tiny低48%，性能超越9倍大的Whisper Small，在多数情况下匹配或超越28倍大的Whisper Medium

Conclusion: 该方法为小规模模型设定了新的技术标准，使先前支持有限的语言能够实现准确的设备端语音识别

Abstract: We present the Flavors of Moonshine, a suite of tiny automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models specialized for a range of underrepresented languages.
Prevailing wisdom suggests that multilingual ASR models outperform monolingual
counterparts by exploiting cross-lingual phonetic similarities. We challenge
this assumption, showing that for sufficiently small models (27M parameters),
training monolingual systems on a carefully balanced mix of high-quality
human-labeled, pseudo-labeled, and synthetic data yields substantially superior
performance. On average, our models achieve error rates 48% lower than the
comparably sized Whisper Tiny model, outperform the 9x larger Whisper Small
model, and in most cases match or outperform the 28x larger Whisper Medium
model. These results advance the state of the art for models of this size,
enabling accurate on-device ASR for languages that previously had limited
support. We release Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Ukrainian, and
Vietnamese Moonshine models under a permissive open-source license.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DARLING框架通过强化学习同时优化回答质量和语义多样性，解决了大语言模型后训练中准确性和多样性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的后训练往往过度追求准确性和帮助性，导致输出分布过于集中，限制了在创意和探索性任务中的实用性。

Method: 提出多样性感知强化学习(DARLING)框架，引入学习的分区函数来测量语义多样性，将多样性信号与质量奖励结合进行在线强化学习。

Result: 在非可验证任务(指令跟随和创意写作)和可验证任务(竞赛数学)上均表现优异，产生更高质量和更新颖的输出，同时提高了解决方案质量和多样性。

Conclusion: 显式优化多样性能够催化在线强化学习中的探索，从而产生更高质量的响应，证明质量与多样性可以协同优化。

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LMs) often prioritizes accuracy and
helpfulness at the expense of diversity. This creates a tension: while
post-training improves response quality, it also sharpens output distributions
and reduces the range of ideas, limiting the usefulness of LMs in creative and
exploratory tasks such as brainstorming, storytelling, or problem solving. We
address this challenge with Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (DARLING), a
framework that jointly optimizes for response quality and semantic diversity.
At its core, DARLING introduces a learned partition function to measure
diversity beyond surface-level lexical variations. This diversity signal is
then combined with a quality reward during online reinforcement learning,
encouraging models to generate outputs that are both high-quality and distinct.
Experiments across multiple model families and sizes show that DARLING
generalizes to two regimes: non-verifiable tasks (instruction following and
creative writing) and verifiable tasks (competition math). On five benchmarks
in the first setting, DARLING consistently outperforms quality-only RL
baselines, producing outputs that are simultaneously of higher quality and
novelty. In the second setting, DARLING achieves higher pass@1 (solution
quality) and pass@k (solution variety). Most strikingly, explicitly optimizing
for diversity catalyzes exploration in online RL, which manifests itself as
higher-quality responses.

### [350] [PalmX 2025: The First Shared Task on Benchmarking LLMs on Arabic and Islamic Culture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02550)
*Fakhraddin Alwajih,Abdellah El Mekki,Hamdy Mubarak,Majd Hawasly,Abubakr Mohamed,Muhammad Abdul-Mageed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PalmX 2025是首个针对LLMs在阿拉伯和伊斯兰文化领域文化能力的基准测试，包含阿拉伯文化和伊斯兰文化两个子任务，结果显示任务特定微调显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在预训练阶段主要接触西方高资源语言和文化数据，导致对阿拉伯和伊斯兰文化的理解存在明显差距，特别是对代表性不足的主题。

Method: 设计了包含多项选择题的两个子任务：通用阿拉伯文化和通用伊斯兰文化，涵盖22个阿拉伯国家的传统、食物、历史、宗教实践和语言表达等广泛主题。

Result: 26个团队注册子任务1，19个注册子任务2，分别有9个和6个有效提交。最佳系统在文化问题上达到72.15%准确率，在伊斯兰知识上达到84.22%。参数高效微调是最主流有效的方法。

Conclusion: 任务特定微调显著提升LLMs在阿拉伯和伊斯兰文化领域的表现，参数高效微调是最有效方法，数据增强的效用取决于具体领域。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently reflect the vast data distributions
they encounter during their pre-training phase. As this data is predominantly
sourced from the web, there is a high chance it will be skewed towards
high-resourced languages and cultures, such as those of the West. Consequently,
LLMs often exhibit a diminished understanding of certain communities, a gap
that is particularly evident in their knowledge of Arabic and Islamic cultures.
This issue becomes even more pronounced with increasingly under-represented
topics. To address this critical challenge, we introduce PalmX 2025, the first
shared task designed to benchmark the cultural competence of LLMs in these
specific domains. The task is composed of two subtasks featuring
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA): General
Arabic Culture and General Islamic Culture. These subtasks cover a wide range
of topics, including traditions, food, history, religious practices, and
language expressions from across 22 Arab countries. The initiative drew
considerable interest, with 26 teams registering for Subtask 1 and 19 for
Subtask 2, culminating in nine and six valid submissions, respectively. Our
findings reveal that task-specific fine-tuning substantially boosts performance
over baseline models. The top-performing systems achieved an accuracy of 72.15%
on cultural questions and 84.22% on Islamic knowledge. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning emerged as the predominant and most effective approach among
participants, while the utility of data augmentation was found to be
domain-dependent.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对四种口吃检测模型(YOLO-Stutter、FluentNet、UDM、SSDM)进行了系统性比较分析，从性能、可控性和可解释性三个维度评估，发现UDM在准确性和临床可解释性方面达到最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然口吃检测模型在基准数据集上的性能不断提升，但临床采用不仅需要准确性，还需要模型具有可控性和可解释性。

Method: 通过在多数据集上的综合评估和临床专家评估，系统比较四种代表性方法，并提供详细的实现见解和实际部署考虑。

Result: YOLO-Stutter和FluentNet提供效率和简单性但透明度有限；UDM实现准确性和临床可解释性的最佳平衡；SSDM在实验中无法完全复现。

Conclusion: 分析突出了不同方法之间的权衡，为临床可行的口吃检测模型指明了未来方向，强调需要平衡准确性、可控性和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent advances in dysfluency detection have introduced a variety of modeling
paradigms, ranging from lightweight object-detection inspired networks
(YOLOStutter) to modular interpretable frameworks (UDM). While performance on
benchmark datasets continues to improve, clinical adoption requires more than
accuracy: models must be controllable and explainable. In this paper, we
present a systematic comparative analysis of four representative
approaches--YOLO-Stutter, FluentNet, UDM, and SSDM--along three dimensions:
performance, controllability, and explainability. Through comprehensive
evaluation on multiple datasets and expert clinician assessment, we find that
YOLO-Stutter and FluentNet provide efficiency and simplicity, but with limited
transparency; UDM achieves the best balance of accuracy and clinical
interpretability; and SSDM, while promising, could not be fully reproduced in
our experiments. Our analysis highlights the trade-offs among competing
approaches and identifies future directions for clinically viable dysfluency
modeling. We also provide detailed implementation insights and practical
deployment considerations for each approach.

TL;DR: 本研究通过arXiv论文合成研究级QA问题，评估大语言模型在知识截止日期前后的性能表现，发现没有显著性能衰减，表明多步推理能有效缓解基准污染问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型能力评估面临数据污染问题，静态基准测试难以区分是真正推理还是单纯记忆，需要新的评估方法来验证模型的真实推理能力。

Method: 利用arXiv论文的自然时间结构，从20,277篇论文中合成1,643个多步推理问题，覆盖知识截止日期前后至少6个月的时间段，评估4个前沿模型的表现。

Result: 结果显示不同规模、开发者和发布日期的模型在知识截止日期附近均未出现显著性能衰减，与之前基于公开数据直接检索问题的研究结果相反。

Conclusion: 多步推理合成方法提供了超越浅层记忆的复杂性，能有效缓解基准污染，建议优先采用推理驱动的合成方法来构建基准测试而非简单收集新发布的问题。

Abstract: Capability evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
shadowed by rising concerns of data contamination that cast doubts on whether
static benchmarks measure genuine reasoning or mere memorization. We present an
empirical study using an infinitely scalable framework to synthesize
research-level QA directly from arXiv papers, harnessing the natural temporal
structure of research publications where performance decay after knowledge
cutoffs may indicate potential contamination. We evaluated 4 frontier model
represented by 2 models of different knowledge cutoff dates per family on 1,643
multi-step reasoning questions synthesized from 20,277 arXiv papers stratified
over 26 months, covering at least 6 months before and after all cutoff dates.
Our results consistently showed a lack of significant performance decay near
knowledge cutoff dates for models of various sizes, developers, and release
dates. We further performed a comparative analysis with previous longitudinal
studies that reported significant post-cutoff performance decay using directly
retrieved questions based on public data. we hypothesize that the multi-step
reasoning required by our synthesis pipeline offered additional complexity that
goes deeper than shallow memorization, which effectively serves a mitigation
strategy against benchmark contamination. We fully open source our code and
dataset to aid reproducibility and advocate for a paradigm shift that
prioritize reasoning-driven synthesis to construct benchmarks over simply
collecting newly released questions periodically.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类如何整合他人语言指导与直接经验进行安全快速学习，并探索AI系统如何实现类似的社会学习能力，以促进人机协作学习。

Method: 将预训练语言模型转化为概率模型，建模人类基于信念分享建议的过程，通过贝叶斯推理将语言输入作为证据，在10个视频游戏中进行行为实验和模拟。

Result: 语言指导能够塑造探索行为、加速学习，减少风险交互并加快关键发现，实现了跨代知识积累和成功的人机知识转移。

Conclusion: 结构化、语言兼容的表征可能实现人机协作学习，为开发能够整合语言指导和社会学习的AI系统提供了计算框架。

Abstract: The ability to combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience
is central to human development, enabling safe and rapid learning in new
environments. How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how
might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social
learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world
models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning
a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share
advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate
advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian
inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games,
we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning
by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans
and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations
through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge
transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured,
language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative
learning.

TL;DR: 使用切字符不确定性指导的轻量级精细化循环，小模型在一三分之一成本下达到大模型95%效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决理由模型成本高、延迟大的问题，寻找质量与成本的平衡点

Method: 通过切字符不确定性指标（混淆度、最大entropy、低信心切字符数）触发目标精细化，将紧凑的不确定性报告回传给模型进行纠正

Result: 在理由、数学、代码生成任务中，小模型达到参考理由模型95%质量，成本降至1/3，准确率提半16%点

Conclusion: 这种不确定性感知循环提供了单次推理与豆小理由链之间的有效平衡，适用于生产环境中的质量成本双重考量

Abstract: Reasoning models often outperform smaller models but at 3--5$\times$ higher
cost and added latency. We present entropy-guided refinement: a lightweight,
test-time loop that uses token-level uncertainty to trigger a single, targeted
refinement pass. We extract logprobs, compute Shannon entropy on top-$k$
alternatives, and apply a simple OR-logic trigger over perplexity, maximum
token entropy, and low-confidence-token count. Unlike approaches that use
entropy only for measurement or decoding, we pass a compact uncertainty report
(tokens, confidences, alternatives, context) back to the model to guide
corrective edits. On representative technical queries across reasoning,
mathematics, and code generation tasks, a small model with our loop approaches
95\% of a reference reasoning model's quality at approximately one-third of the
cost. The method achieves selective refinement on ~31\% of responses while
improving accuracy by 16 percentage points over single-pass inference. We
demonstrate that this uncertainty-aware loop provides an effective middle
ground between single-pass inference and expensive reasoning chains, making it
practical for production deployments where both quality and cost matter.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究情绪识别准确性对多智能体社会行为的影响，发现低准确性的情绪分类器会导致信任降低、情绪崩溃和社会组织混乱，而高准确性则能形成稳定的情感集群和情绪韧性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索情绪感知准确性如何影响社会行为，特别是当智能体基于感知而非真实情绪做出反应时，系统性的误判会如何扭曲社会过程和破坏情绪整合。

Method: 在2D环形网格上部署智能体，使用不同准确性（JAFFE、CK+、KDEF数据集训练）的情绪分类器感知邻居情绪，并根据感知结果向积极情绪移动、远离消极情绪。在均质/异质群体和情绪冲击场景下进行实验。

Result: 低准确性分类器导致信任降低、情绪崩溃为悲伤、社会组织混乱；高准确性分类器形成稳定的情感集群和情绪韧性；即使在情绪中性场景中，误判也足以产生隔离和凝聚力瓦解。

Conclusion: 情绪识别中的偏见或不精确可能显著扭曲社会过程并破坏情绪整合，强调了准确情绪感知对社会行为的重要性。

Abstract: The ability of humans to detect and respond to others' emotions is
fundamental to understanding social behavior. Here, agents are instantiated
with emotion classifiers of varying accuracy to study the impact of perceptual
accuracy on emergent emotional and spatial behavior. Agents are visually
represented with face photos from the KDEF database and endowed with one of
three classifiers trained on the JAFFE (poor), CK+ (medium), or KDEF (high)
datasets. Agents communicate locally on a 2D toroidal lattice, perceiving
neighbors' emotional state based on their classifier and responding with
movement toward perceived positive emotions and away from perceived negative
emotions. Note that the agents respond to perceived, instead of ground-truth,
emotions, introducing systematic misperception and frustration. A battery of
experiments is carried out on homogeneous and heterogeneous populations and
scenarios with repeated emotional shocks. Results show that low-accuracy
classifiers on the part of the agent reliably result in diminished trust,
emotional disintegration into sadness, and disordered social organization. By
contrast, the agent that develops high accuracy develops hardy emotional
clusters and resilience to emotional disruptions. Even in emotionally neutral
scenarios, misperception is enough to generate segregation and disintegration
of cohesion. These findings underscore the fact that biases or imprecision in
emotion recognition may significantly warp social processes and disrupt
emotional integration.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在重要决策中扮演更重要角色，确保其与人类价值观对齐至关重要。依赖专有API限制了研究的可复现性和广泛参与，因此研究本地开源模型的集成辩论方法。

Method: 使用本地开源模型进行集成辩论，在15个不同场景下进行了150场辩论，测试了五种集成配置，使用7点评分标准进行评估。

Result: 集成方法整体得分3.48优于单模型基准的3.13，在推理深度提升19.4%，论证质量提升34.1%，真实性和人类增强方面改善最显著（分别+1.25和+0.80分）。

Conclusion: 本地开源模型集成辩论为基于集成的对齐评估提供了可访问和可复现的基础，证明了这种方法在提升AI对齐能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) take on greater roles in high-stakes

outperform single-model baselines on a 7-point rubric (overall: 3.48 vs. 3.13),
with the largest gains in reasoning depth (+19.4%) and argument quality
(+34.1%). Improvements are strongest for truthfulness (+1.25 points) and human

*Rahul Anand*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MODE是一种轻量级的检索增强生成方法，用聚类路由替代精细的最近邻搜索，适用于小规模领域特定文档集，在保持答案质量的同时显著降低检索时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的检索增强生成方法依赖大型向量数据库和跨编码器，对于小规模领域特定文档集来说过于复杂和冗余，需要更轻量级的解决方案。

Method: 将文档嵌入后分组到语义连贯的聚类中，用缓存质心表示。查询时路由到顶部质心，仅在这些聚类内检索上下文，无需外部向量数据库基础设施和重排序。

Result: 在HotpotQA和SQuAD语料库（100-500个文本块）上，MODE在答案质量上匹配或超过密集检索基线，同时显著减少端到端检索时间。

Conclusion: MODE为中小规模语料库提供了实用的解决方案，在简单性、速度和主题聚焦方面具有优势，聚类粒度和多聚类路由可以控制召回率/精确度的权衡。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often relies on large vector databases
and cross-encoders tuned for large-scale corpora, which can be excessive for
small, domain-specific collections. We present MODE (Mixture of Document
Experts), a lightweight alternative that replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor
search with cluster-and-route retrieval. Documents are embedded, grouped into
semantically coherent clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query
time, we route to the top centroid(s) and retrieve context only within those
clusters, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure and reranking
while keeping latency low. On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks,
MODE matches or exceeds a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while
reducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and
multi-cluster routing control the recall/precision trade-off, and that tighter
clusters improve downstream accuracy. MODE offers a practical recipe for small
and medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus matter.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体AI系统评估主要关注技术指标，缺乏对人类中心和经济维度的考虑，需要更全面的监控框架来确保系统在真实部署中的安全性和可靠性。

Method: 开发了自适应多维监控算法(AMDM)，包括指标标准化、基于指数加权移动平均的阈值设定，以及使用马氏距离进行联合异常检测。

Result: AMDM将异常检测延迟从12.3秒降低到5.6秒，误报率从4.5%降至0.9%，在模拟和真实实验中均表现出色。

Conclusion: AMDM算法有效解决了多智能体AI系统监控中的关键问题，提供了更全面和高效的评估方法，有助于促进AI系统在高风险领域的可靠部署。

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine
large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are
rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our
earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary
metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an
algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills
that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to
show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of
84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only
30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an
Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises
heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average
thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance.
Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts
anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and
reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds.
We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies
to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist
accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

Motivation: 传统RLVF仅依赖稀疏的结果奖励，无法为推理过程提供细粒度指导，限制了学习效率

Method: 提出DACE算法，基于策略成功率在线评估任务难度，通过内在奖励机制：困难任务惩罚高确定性鼓励探索，简单任务奖励高确定性提升效率

Result: 在AIME和MATH数学推理基准测试中显著超越强基线，模型不仅准确率更高，而且在测试时计算扩展时表现更稳健

Conclusion: DACE的自适应方法能够在不牺牲精度的前提下促进有效探索，验证了利用模型自我确定性指导强化学习的有效性

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Feedback (RLVF) has become a key
technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, its reliance on sparse, outcome based rewards, which only
indicate if a final answer is correct or not, fails to provide granular
guidance on the reasoning process itself. This limitation hinders efficient
learning, as the model cannot distinguish between high quality and inefficient
solutions, nor can it learn effectively from different types of failures. To
address this, we observe that an LLMs self-certainty often correlates with task
difficulty and solution quality. We introduce Difficulty Aware Certainty guided
Exploration (DACE), a novel RL algorithm that leverages this insight to
dynamically balance the exploration exploitation trade-off. DACE assesses task
difficulty online based on the policys success rate. It then uses this signal
to modulate an intrinsic reward: for difficult tasks where the model is
struggling, DACE encourages exploration by penalizing high certainty; for
easier tasks, it encourages learning efficiency by rewarding high certainty.
Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH) show
that DACE significantly outperforms strong baselines. The DACE-trained models
not only achieve higher accuracy but also demonstrate more robust performance
when scaling test-time compute, validating that our adaptive approach fosters
effective exploration without sacrificing precision.

Conclusion: HARP工具为资源有限的医疗设施规划提供了有效的优化解决方案，能够帮助实现全民健康覆盖目标

Abstract: As part of nationwide efforts aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable
Development Goal 3 on Universal Health Coverage, Ethiopia's Ministry of Health
is strengthening health posts to expand access to essential healthcare
services. However, only a fraction of this health system strengthening effort
can be implemented each year due to limited budgets and other competing
priorities, thus the need for an optimization framework to guide prioritization
across the regions of Ethiopia. In this paper, we develop a tool, Health Access
Resource Planner (HARP), based on a principled decision-support optimization
framework for sequential facility planning that aims to maximize population
coverage under budget uncertainty while satisfying region-specific
proportionality targets at every time step. We then propose two algorithms: (i)
a learning-augmented approach that improves upon expert recommendations at any
single-step; and (ii) a greedy algorithm for multi-step planning, both with
strong worst-case approximation estimation. In collaboration with the Ethiopian
Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we demonstrated the empirical
efficacy of our method on three regions across various planning scenarios.

Abstract: We study notions of (virtual) group knowledge and group belief within

evidence-based belief and fallible knowledge from individuals to groups. We
completely axiomatize and show the decidability of the logic of ("hard" and
"soft") group evidence, and do the same for an especially interesting fragment
of it: the logic of group knowledge and group belief. We also extend these
languages with dynamic evidence-sharing operators, and completely axiomatize
the corresponding logics, showing that they are co-expressive with their static
bases.

*Jinzhou Tang,Jusheng Zhang,Qinhan Lv,Sidi Liu,Jing Yang,Chengpei Tang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiVA是一个新颖的自主代理框架，通过语义-拓扑进化算法将工作流建模为自组织图，在未知环境中实现5-10%的任务准确率提升和资源效率增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自主代理范式面临关键权衡：固定工作流需要手动重新配置，而灵活反应循环无法将推理进展转化为可转移结构。

Method: 使用语义-拓扑进化(STEV)算法，将代理工作流建模为自组织图，通过多臂老虎机前向路由、环境反馈生成诊断梯度，以及协调更新来共同进化个体语义和拓扑。

Result: 在对话、编码、长上下文问答、数学和代理基准测试中，任务准确率比现有基线提高5-10%，资源效率也得到增强。

Conclusion: HiVA框架在自主任务执行方面表现出有效性，通过自组织图结构和语义-拓扑协同优化解决了现有范式的局限性。

Abstract: Autonomous agents play a crucial role in advancing Artificial General
Intelligence, enabling problem decomposition and tool orchestration through
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing paradigms face a critical
trade-off. On one hand, reusable fixed workflows require manual reconfiguration
upon environmental changes; on the other hand, flexible reactive loops fail to
distill reasoning progress into transferable structures. We introduce
Hierarchical Variable Agent (HiVA), a novel framework modeling agentic
workflows as self-organized graphs with the Semantic-Topological Evolution
(STEV) algorithm, which optimizes hybrid semantic-topological spaces using
textual gradients as discrete-domain surrogates for backpropagation. The
iterative process comprises Multi-Armed Bandit-infused forward routing,
diagnostic gradient generation from environmental feedback, and coordinated
updates that co-evolve individual semantics and topology for collective
optimization in unknown environments. Experiments on dialogue, coding,
Long-context Q&A, mathematical, and agentic benchmarks demonstrate improvements
of 5-10% in task accuracy and enhanced resource efficiency over existing
baselines, establishing HiVA's effectiveness in autonomous task execution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度研究智能体都是硬编码特定研究策略和使用固定工具，缺乏灵活性和通用性。

Method: 开发了UDR系统，包装任何语言模型，提供用户界面让用户实验不同的研究策略（最小化、扩展性和密集型）。

Conclusion: UDR系统为深度研究提供了更灵活和可定制的解决方案，突破了现有硬编码方法的限制。

Abstract: Deep research tools are among the most impactful and most commonly
encountered agentic systems today. We observe, however, that each deep research
agent introduced so far is hard-coded to carry out a particular research
strategy using a fixed choice of tools. We introduce Universal Deep Research
(UDR), a generalist agentic system that wraps around any language model and
enables the user to create, edit, and refine their own entirely custom deep
research strategies without any need for additional training or finetuning. To
showcase the generality of our system, we equip UDR with example minimal,
expansive, and intensive research strategies, and provide a user interface to
facilitate experimentation with the system.

### [364] [Instruction-Level Weight Shaping: A Framework for Self-Improving AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00251)
*Rimom Costa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ILWS通过指令级权重塑形技术，让大语言模型能够通过会话反馈和反思动态更新指令参数，实现知识持续优化而无需重新训练或检索增强，显著提升企业支持场景的性能和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型静态知识更新的痛点：RAG增加延迟和工程开销，提示工程脆弱且可能冲突，微调成本高且有灾难性遗忘风险。需要一种动态、可审计的知识更新方法。

Method: Instruction-Level Weight Shaping (ILWS)：使用系统指令作为外部伪参数，通过反思引擎分析会话轨迹，提出类型化增量更新(ΔS, ΔU, ΔT)，版本控制并通过评分评估，最终将成熟的指令空间增益蒸馏到权重空间。

Result: 在企业支持中吞吐量提升2.4-5.0倍，审计幻觉减少约80%；在Adobe Commerce Cloud概念验证中，每小时处理工单数提升4-5倍，单工单时间降低约80%，支持自主指令更新和工具合成。

Conclusion: ILWS在指令层操作直到受控蒸馏，适用于需要自适应推理、工具创建和低延迟部署的动态领域（法律、医疗、工程），提供了可治理的动态知识更新解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are fluent but largely static after
pre-training; new or shifting knowledge is typically added with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or fine-tuning. RAG raises latency and
engineering overhead and often fails to integrate facts; prompt engineering is
brittle and can conflict with prior knowledge; fine-tuning is costly and risks
catastrophic forgetting. We propose Instruction-Level Weight Shaping (ILWS):
curated system instructions act as external, auditable pseudo-parameters
updated after each session via reflection and user feedback. A Reflection
Engine inspects conversation traces, diagnoses reasoning successes and
failures, and proposes typed deltas $\Delta K=(\Delta S,\Delta U,\Delta T)$
over instructions, user preferences, and tools. Deltas are version-controlled,
evaluated with a sliding window of 1-5 star ratings, auto-repaired on first
failure, and rolled back on repeated failure. When an edit budget crosses a
threshold, the agent compiles a rating-weighted synthetic set and distills
matured instruction-space gains into parameters, converting prompt-space
improvements into weight-space without downtime. ILWS makes explicit the
low-rank shaping induced by context in transformer blocks, preserves
governance, and removes per-call retrieval. In enterprise support it increased
throughput 2.4-5.0x and cut audited hallucinations by about 80% versus a frozen
baseline. In an Adobe Commerce Cloud proof of concept "L0 Support", it achieved
4-5x more tickets per hour and about 80% lower time per ticket, with autonomous
instruction updates and optional tool synthesis. Because ILWS operates at the
instruction layer until controlled distillation, it generalizes to dynamic
domains (legal, medical, engineering) requiring adaptive reasoning, tool
creation, and low-latency deployment.

*Boqi Chen,Kua Chen,José Antonio Hernández López,Gunter Mussbacher,Dániel Varró,Amir Feizpour*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SHERPA是一个模型驱动框架，通过将领域特定最佳实践融入分层状态机来提升LLM在复杂任务中的表现，实现了对LLM行为的细粒度控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM缺乏结构化推理能力，特别是在需要领域特定最佳实践的复杂任务中。虽然多步提示方法（如思维链和思维树）很流行，但缺乏控制LLM行为的通用机制。

Method: 提出SHERPA框架，使用分层状态机结构化LLM执行过程，通过基于规则或机器学习（包括LLM）的方法实现细粒度行为控制。

Result: 在代码生成、类名生成和问答等多种任务中，SHERPA不仅复现了先前方法，还进一步提升了性能。系统评估显示，精心设计的状态机显著提高了LLM输出质量。

Conclusion: SHERPA特别适用于具有完善人类最佳实践但缺乏训练数据的复杂任务，为LLM的行为控制提供了有效的通用机制。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved widespread application
across various fields. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs suffer from
a lack of structured reasoning ability, particularly for complex tasks
requiring domain-specific best practices, which are often unavailable in the
training data. Although multi-step prompting methods incorporating human best
practices, such as chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought, have gained
popularity, they lack a general mechanism to control LLM behavior. In this
paper, we propose SHERPA, a model-driven framework to improve the LLM
performance on complex tasks by explicitly incorporating domain-specific best
practices into hierarchical state machines. By structuring the LLM execution
processes using state machines, SHERPA enables more fine-grained control over
their behavior via rules or decisions driven by machine learning-based
approaches, including LLMs. We show that SHERPA is applicable to a wide variety
of tasks-specifically, code generation, class name generation, and question
answering-replicating previously proposed approaches while further improving
the performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SHERPA for the
aforementioned tasks using various LLMs. Our systematic evaluation compares
different state machine configurations against baseline approaches without
state machines. Results show that integrating well-designed state machines
significantly improves the quality of LLM outputs, and is particularly
beneficial for complex tasks with well-established human best practices but
lacking data used for training LLMs.

*Brian Wang,Mani Srivastava*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SIGMUS系统利用大语言模型自动整合城市多模态传感器数据，构建知识图谱来识别和分析城市事件，无需依赖人工规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代城市拥有大量多模态传感器数据，但数据分散且难以整合，需要人工推理来识别事件与多模态数据之间的关系。传统方法依赖人工编码规则，效率低下且难以扩展。

Method: 开发SIGMUS系统，使用大语言模型(LLMs)生成必要的世界知识，识别城市事件与多模态数据之间的关系，将组织化的知识表示为知识图谱，包含事件、观察结果等元素。

Result: 系统能够合理连接5种不同数据源（新闻文本、监控图像、空气质量、天气和交通测量数据）与同时同地发生的相关事件。

Conclusion: SIGMUS系统成功实现了城市多模态数据的语义集成，通过LLMs自动构建知识图谱，有效解决了多源数据整合和事件关系识别的挑战。

Abstract: Modern urban spaces are equipped with an increasingly diverse set of sensors,
all producing an abundance of multimodal data. Such multimodal data can be used
to identify and reason about important incidents occurring in urban landscapes,
such as major emergencies, cultural and social events, as well as natural
disasters. However, such data may be fragmented over several sources and
difficult to integrate due to the reliance on human-driven reasoning for
identifying relationships between the multimodal data corresponding to an
incident, as well as understanding the different components which define an
incident. Such relationships and components are critical to identifying the
causes of such incidents, as well as producing forecasting the scale and
intensity of future incidents as they begin to develop. In this work, we create
SIGMUS, a system for Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal
Urban Spaces. SIGMUS uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce the necessary
world knowledge for identifying relationships between incidents occurring in
urban spaces and data from different modalities, allowing us to organize
evidence and observations relevant to an incident without relying and
human-encoded rules for relating multimodal sensory data with incidents. This
organized knowledge is represented as a knowledge graph, organizing incidents,
observations, and much more. We find that our system is able to produce
reasonable connections between 5 different data sources (new article text, CCTV
images, air quality, weather, and traffic measurements) and relevant incidents
occurring at the same time and location.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NEWSAGENT是一个评估自主代理在新闻写作中处理多模态网络数据能力的基准测试，包含6000个人工验证的真实新闻案例，测试代理的搜索、信息选择、编辑和新闻整合能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前行业中的自主数字代理（如Manus AI和Gemini研究模式）在结构化任务中展现出潜力，但尚不清楚基于代理的系统能在多大程度上提高多模态网络数据生产力，特别是在需要迭代规划、解释和上下文推理的新闻领域。

Method: 引入NEWSAGENT基准测试，要求代理根据写作指令和原始数据，识别叙事视角、进行关键词查询、检索历史背景并生成完整文章。测试包含6k个真实新闻转换的多模态文本示例，评估开源和闭源LLM在常用代理框架上的表现。

Result: 评估结果显示，代理能够检索相关事实，但在规划和叙事整合方面存在困难，表明当前代理系统在复杂新闻写作任务中仍有局限性。

Conclusion: NEWSAGENT为迭代和评估代理在多模态网络数据操作到实际生产力方面的能力提供了一个现实的测试平台，有助于推动自主代理在新闻写作等复杂任务中的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous digital agents from industry (e.g., Manus AI
and Gemini's research mode) highlight potential for structured tasks by
autonomous decision-making and task decomposition; however, it remains unclear
to what extent the agent-based systems can improve multimodal web data
productivity. We study this in the realm of journalism, which requires
iterative planning, interpretation, and contextual reasoning from multimodal
raw contents to form a well structured news. We introduce NEWSAGENT, a
benchmark for evaluating how agents can automatically search available raw
contents, select desired information, and edit and rephrase to form a news
article by accessing core journalistic functions. Given a writing instruction
and firsthand data as how a journalist initiates a news draft, agents are
tasked to identify narrative perspectives, issue keyword-based queries,
retrieve historical background, and generate complete articles. Unlike typical
summarization or retrieval tasks, essential context is not directly available
and must be actively discovered, reflecting the information gaps faced in
real-world news writing. NEWSAGENT includes 6k human-verified examples derived
from real news, with multimodal contents converted to text for broad model
compatibility. We evaluate open- and closed-sourced LLMs with commonly-used
agentic frameworks on NEWSAGENT, which shows that agents are capable of
retrieving relevant facts but struggling with planning and narrative
integration. We believe that NEWSAGENT serves a realistic testbed for iterating
and evaluating agent capabilities in terms of multimodal web data manipulation
to real-world productivity.

lightweight multi-agent system that automates the data analysis workflow, from
data exploration to generating coherent visual narratives for insight
communication. Our approach combines a hybrid multi-agent architecture with
deterministic components, strategically externalizing critical logic from LLMs
to improve transparency and reliability. The system delivers granular, modular
outputs that enable surgical modifications without full regeneration,
supporting sustainable human-AI collaboration. We evaluated our system across 4
diverse datasets, demonstrating strong generalizability, narrative quality, and
computational efficiency with minimal dependencies.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了刺槐豆胶、瓜尔胶、麦芽糊精和卡拉胶对自制冰淇淋融化行为的影响，通过融化测试和图像分析评估这些稳定剂的融化抗性，旨在寻找成本效益更优的配方。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰淇淋的融化稳定性是影响消费者接受度和产品质量的关键因素，需要研究不同稳定剂对融化行为的影响，并寻求更经济有效的配方方案。

Method: 制备含不同添加剂的冰淇淋样品，在受控条件下进行融化测试，使用延时摄影记录融化过程，并利用Python和OpenCV进行图像处理和分析。

Result: 所有样品融化后仍保持泡沫状结构，表明稳定剂有助于形成稳定的气室基质；重新冷冻后再次融化的样品显示出更强的结构稳定性；不同稳定剂的效果存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了常用食品添加剂在冰淇淋配方中的功能作用，通过评估性能和成本，证明了开发兼顾耐用性和经济效率的配方潜力，对小型和商业冰淇淋生产具有实用价值。

Abstract: The stability of ice cream during melting is a critical factor for consumer's
acceptance and product quality. With the commonly added stabilizer to improve
texture, structure and slower melting as the factors to analyze. This report
explores the effects of locust bean gum, guar gum, maltodextrin, and
carrageenan on the melting behavior of homemade ice cream. The main objective
was to assess how these additives influence melting resistance and to identify
a more cost-effective recipe formulation. Ice cream samples incorporating each
additive were prepared and subjected to melting tests under controlled
conditions. Timelapse recordings were used to capture and analyze the
progression of melting over time. Python and OpenCV is used for process and
analysis. Observations revealed that all samples retained a foam-like structure
even after melting, suggesting the stabilizers contributed to the formation of
a stable air-cell matrix. Furthermore, when the melted samples were re-frozen
and subsequently melted again, they displayed increased sturdiness, indicating
improved resilience of the ice cream structure. Comparative analysis of the
different stabilizers highlighted variations in their effectiveness, with some
offering stronger melting resistance and structural support than others.
Overall, the findings provide insights into the functional roles of commonly
used food additives in ice cream formulation. By evaluating both performance
and cost, this study demonstrates the potential for developing recipes that
balance durability with economic efficiency, contributing to practical
applications in both small-scale and commercial ice cream production.

Motivation: 现有方法如静态提示工程或孤立智能体模拟存在局限性，需要一种动态的、可扩展的集体智能框架，能够实现自适应学习和知识共享。

Method: 1) 用户与LLM形成认知二元组构建子类大脑；2) 通过遗传算法辅助的前后向进化优化提示和任务性能；3) 多个子类大脑通过群体智能协调；4) 整合为标准化的超类大脑实现元智能。

Result: 提出了理论框架和初步实现（如无人机调度、关键词过滤），建立了跨二元组知识整合的注册机制。

Conclusion: 该工作为可扩展、可解释且符合伦理的集体AI提供了概念基础和架构路线图。

Abstract: We propose a novel SuperBrain framework for collective intelligence, grounded
in the co-evolution of large language models (LLMs) and human users. Unlike
static prompt engineering or isolated agent simulations, our approach
emphasizes a dynamic pathway from Subclass Brain to Superclass Brain: (1) A
Subclass Brain arises from persistent, personalized interaction between a user
and an LLM, forming a cognitive dyad with adaptive learning memory. (2) Through
GA-assisted forward-backward evolution, these dyads iteratively refine prompts
and task performance. (3) Multiple Subclass Brains coordinate via Swarm
Intelligence, optimizing across multi-objective fitness landscapes and
exchanging distilled heuristics. (4) Their standardized behaviors and cognitive
signatures integrate into a Superclass Brain, an emergent meta-intelligence
capable of abstraction, generalization and self-improvement. We outline the
theoretical constructs, present initial implementations (e.g., UAV scheduling,
KU/KI keyword filtering) and propose a registry for cross-dyad knowledge
consolidation. This work provides both a conceptual foundation and an
architectural roadmap toward scalable, explainable and ethically aligned
collective AI.

plans from natural language prompts. The proposed system interprets textual
input to automatically generate layout options including walls, doors, windows,

case study of a mid-sized residential layout demonstrates the approach's
ability to generate functional and structured outputs with minimal manual
effort. The workflow is designed for transparent replication, with all key
prompt specifications documented to enable independent implementation by other

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够直觉地模拟未言明的社会动态并推理他人视角，而AI系统在处理这些隐含社会语境时存在困难，需要更好的结构化表示方法。

Method: 采用POMDP驱动的设计，将社会互动表示为结构化元组（状态、观察、智能体行动、心理状态），可以从自由形式叙述中自动推导。

Result: 在5个社会推理任务中显著提升性能（如FANToM的心理理论推理提升51%），社会世界模型能够预测未来社会动态，在SOTOPIA社交互动基准上提升18%。

Conclusion: S3AP作为一种强大的通用社会世界状态表示形式，有望开发出更具社会意识的系统，更好地导航社会互动。

Abstract: Humans intuitively navigate social interactions by simulating unspoken
dynamics and reasoning about others' perspectives, even with limited
information. In contrast, AI systems struggle to automatically structure and
reason about these implicit social contexts. In this paper, we introduce a
novel structured social world representation formalism (S3AP), designed to help
AI systems reason more effectively about social dynamics. Following a
POMDP-driven design, S3AP represents social interactions as structured tuples,
such as state, observation, agent actions, and mental states, which can be
automatically induced from free-form narratives or other inputs. We first show
S3AP can help LLMs better understand social narratives across 5 social
reasoning tasks (e.g., +51% improvement on FANToM's theory-of-mind reasoning
with OpenAI's o1), reaching new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We then
induce social world models from these structured representations, demonstrating
their ability to predict future social dynamics and improve agent
decision-making, yielding up to +18% improvement on the SOTOPIA social
interaction benchmark. Our findings highlight the promise of S3AP as a
powerful, general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling the
development of more socially-aware systems that better navigate social
interactions.

TL;DR: BALM-TSF是一个轻量级多模态时间序列预测框架，通过平衡文本和时间序列模态的对齐来解决现有方法中模态不平衡问题，在最小可训练参数下实现了最先进的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的多模态时间序列预测方法存在模态不平衡问题，往往过度强调文本模态而忽视时间序列模态，导致信息损失和预测性能下降。

Method: 使用时间序列编码器处理原始时间序列，同时将时间序列的描述性统计特征输入带有可学习提示的大语言模型生成文本嵌入。通过简单的缩放策略和对比目标将文本嵌入映射到时间序列嵌入的潜在空间，实现跨模态平衡对齐。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，BALM-TSF在长期预测和少样本预测任务上都达到了最先进的性能，证明了其有效利用文本和时间序列互补信息的能力。

Conclusion: BALM-TSF通过平衡的多模态对齐机制成功解决了模态不平衡问题，以最小的计算成本实现了优异的预测性能，为多模态时间序列预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a long-standing and highly challenging research
topic. Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research
has increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing
textual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast
discrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal
architectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other,
resulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address
this modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment
for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting
framework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw
time series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive
statistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt,
producing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context
alignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling
strategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual
embeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the
aligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together
integrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show
that, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability
to harness complementary information from text and time series. Code is
available at https://github.com/ShiqiaoZhou/BALM-TSF.

TL;DR: NetGent是一个AI代理框架，通过自然语言规则自动化复杂应用工作流来生成真实的网络流量数据集，解决了现有浏览器自动化工具在多样性、可重复性、真实性和效率方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发通用ML网络模型需要从具有多样化真实网络应用流量的环境中收集数据，但现有的浏览器自动化工具在保持多样性、可重复性、真实性和效率方面仍然脆弱且成本高昂。

Method: 用户通过自然语言规则定义状态依赖动作的工作流，这些抽象规范被编译成非确定性有限自动机(NFAs)，然后通过状态合成组件转换为可重用的可执行代码。

Result: NetGent成功自动化了50多个工作流，涵盖视频点播、直播、视频会议、社交媒体和网络爬虫等领域，生成了真实的流量轨迹，并对UI变化保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NetGent通过结合基于语言代理的灵活性和编译执行的可靠性，为生成多样化、可重复的数据集提供了可扩展的基础，推动了网络ML的发展。

Abstract: We present NetGent, an AI-agent framework for automating complex application
workflows to generate realistic network traffic datasets. Developing
generalizable ML models for networking requires data collection from network
environments with traffic that results from a diverse set of real-world web
applications. However, using existing browser automation tools that are
diverse, repeatable, realistic, and efficient remains fragile and costly.
NetGent addresses this challenge by allowing users to specify workflows as
natural-language rules that define state-dependent actions. These abstract
specifications are compiled into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), which
a state synthesis component translates into reusable, executable code. This
design enables deterministic replay, reduces redundant LLM calls through state
caching, and adapts quickly when application interfaces change. In experiments,
NetGent automated more than 50+ workflows spanning video-on-demand streaming,
live video streaming, video conferencing, social media, and web scraping,
producing realistic traffic traces while remaining robust to UI variability. By
combining the flexibility of language-based agents with the reliability of
compiled execution, NetGent provides a scalable foundation for generating the
diverse, repeatable datasets needed to advance ML in networking.

stages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and
formalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes.
The second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps:
analyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing
symbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating
final answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the
ontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with
symbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points,
significantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches.
Evaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial
improvements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\% accuracy compared to
18.8\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between
reasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular
architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated
legal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while
enhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a
foundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and
effective AI systems for legal domain.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OmniDPO是一个针对全模态大语言模型的偏好对齐框架，通过构建文本偏好和多模态偏好样本对，有效减少多模态幻觉问题并提升跨模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的全模态大语言模型存在幻觉问题，文本先验主导导致忽视视觉和音频信息，且训练时独立对齐各模态而忽略了视频与音频的内在关联。

Method: 提出OmniDPO框架，包含两种策略：(1)构建文本偏好样本对增强音频-视频交互理解；(2)构建多模态偏好样本对强化对视觉和听觉信息的关注。

Result: 在两个OLLM上的实验表明，OmniDPO不仅能有效缓解多模态幻觉，还显著提升了模型的跨模态推理能力。

Conclusion: OmniDPO通过同时解决文本主导和模态关联两个挑战，有效改善了多模态基础能力并减少了幻觉现象。

Abstract: Recently, Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) have sparked a new wave of
research, achieving impressive results in tasks such as audio-video
understanding and real-time environment perception. However, hallucination
issues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text
modality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues
while neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal
scenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or
auditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the
intrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This
oversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden
audio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose
OmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations
in OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing
text-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of
audio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample
pairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information.
By tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding
and reduces hallucination. Experiments conducted on two OLLMs demonstrate that
OmniDPO not only effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also
significantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities across modalities.
All code and datasets will be released upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结构化上下文注入框架，通过将任务特定信息系统性地嵌入输入中来指导LLMs解决图问题，无需微调即可实现性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图推理任务对LLMs具有挑战性，需要将问题映射到概念基础表示，但通过微调或多步查询实现这种映射成本高且效率低

Method: 开发结构化上下文注入框架，将任务特定信息直接嵌入输入，使LLM能够隐式地将任务与基础概念空间对齐

Result: 在多个图任务上评估显示性能一致提升，结构化输入上下文可以媲美或超越更复杂的方法

Conclusion: 结构化上下文注入是LLMs图理解的有效且可扩展策略，在准确性和计算成本之间提供了良好权衡

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in solving
problems across domains, including graph-related tasks traditionally addressed
by symbolic or algorithmic methods. In this work, we present a framework for
structured context injection, where task-specific information is systematically
embedded in the input to guide LLMs in solving a wide range of graph problems.
Our method does not require fine-tuning of LLMs, making it cost-efficient and
lightweight. We observe that certain graph reasoning tasks remain challenging
for LLMs unless they are mapped to conceptually grounded representations.
However, achieving such mappings through fine-tuning or repeated multi-step
querying can be expensive and inefficient. Our approach offers a practical
alternative by injecting structured context directly into the input, enabling
the LLM to implicitly align the task with grounded conceptual spaces. We
evaluate the approach on multiple graph tasks using both lightweight and large
models, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost.
The results demonstrate consistent performance improvements, showing that
structured input context can rival or surpass more complex approaches. Our
findings underscore the value of structured context injection as an effective
and scalable strategy for graph understanding with LLMs.

TL;DR: L-MARS是一个多智能体法律问答系统，通过协调推理和搜索减少幻觉和不确定性，在LegalSearchQA基准上显著提升准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统RAG系统在法律问答中存在的幻觉、不确定性和检索噪声问题，为高风险法律领域提供精确可靠的法律检索和推理方案。

Method: 采用多智能体工作流：分解查询为子问题，在异构源（网络搜索、本地RAG、案例法）进行定向搜索，法官智能体验证充分性、管辖权和时效性，通过迭代推理-搜索-验证循环合成答案。

Result: 在2025年200个最新法律选择题的LegalSearchQA基准上，L-MARS显著提高事实准确性、减少不确定性，获得人类专家和LLM法官更高的偏好评分。

Conclusion: 多智能体推理与主动搜索相结合为高风险领域LLM部署提供了可扩展、可复现的蓝图，能够实现精确的法律检索和审议。

Abstract: We present L-MARS (Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and
Agentic Search), a system that reduces hallucination and uncertainty in legal
question answering through coordinated multi-agent reasoning and retrieval.
Unlike single-pass retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), L-MARS decomposes
queries into subproblems, issues targeted searches across heterogeneous sources
(Serper web, local RAG, CourtListener case law), and employs a Judge Agent to
verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer
synthesis. This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains
coherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We
evaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple
choice legal questions in 2025. Results show that L-MARS substantially improves
factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores
from both human experts and LLM-based judges. Our work demonstrates that
multi-agent reasoning with agentic search offers a scalable and reproducible
blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring precise legal
retrieval and deliberation.

Motivation: AI驱动的材料发现需要准确、校准且物理可接受的配方到属性预测器，现有方法基于二进制正确性或学习偏好信号选择推理轨迹，不能很好地反映物理可接受性

Method: 引入Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS)训练时轨迹选择方案，优先选择符合基础物理原理且数值接近目标的轨迹，使用轻量级停止机制控制计算成本

Conclusion: 适度的领域感知约束结合轨迹级选择为过程感知属性预测和闭环材料设计提供了可靠、高效的大型推理模型的实用路径

Abstract: AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with
algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property
predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We
approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To
instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces
from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines
select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals
that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware
Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors
traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets,
with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with
a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher
model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection
sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces
physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These
results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with
trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs
for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在马尔可夫决策过程中优化夏普比率的新方法，通过Dinkelbach变换将分数目标转换为均值-方差优化问题，并开发了收敛的迭代算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夏普比率是金融领域广泛使用的风险调整收益指标，但在MDP中优化夏普比率面临两个挑战：动态规划不适用于分数目标和风险度量。

Method: 使用Dinkelbach变换将夏普比率优化转换为均值-方差优化问题，开发迭代算法求解M2V问题并更新风险敏感参数，证明序列单调收敛。

Result: 提出了针对平均和折扣MDP设置的政策迭代程序，证明其收敛到最优解，数值实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 这是首个使用动态规划类算法解决MDP中夏普比率优化问题的方法，为解决其他分数目标MDP问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sharpe ratio (also known as reward-to-variability ratio) is a widely-used
metric in finance, which measures the additional return at the cost of per unit
of increased risk (standard deviation of return). However, the optimization of
Sharpe ratio in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is challenging, because there
exist two difficulties hindering the application of dynamic programming. One is
that dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other
is that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we
study the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both
the long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge
with the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a
mean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. It is shown that the M2V optimization
and the original Sharpe ratio optimization share the same optimal policy when
the risk-sensitive parameter is equal to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For the
second challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V
optimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs. We
iteratively solve the M2V problem and obtain the associated Sharpe ratio that
is used to update the risk-sensitive parameter in the next iteration of M2V
problems. We show that such a sequence of Sharpe ratios derived is
monotonically increasing and converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For both
average and discounted MDP settings, we develop a policy iteration procedure
and prove its convergence to the optimum. Numerical experiments are conducted
for validation. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that
solves the Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs with dynamic programming type
algorithms. We believe that the proposed algorithm can shed light on solving
MDPs with other fractional objectives.

Motivation: 现有的深度学习方法在业务过程管理的后缀预测中往往无法满足基本逻辑约束，因为缺乏领域知识的显式整合。

Method: 使用有限迹上的线性时态逻辑(LTLf)和Gumbel-Softmax技巧，构建可微逻辑损失函数，与标准预测损失结合训练自回归序列预测器。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法提高了后缀预测的准确性和时态约束的符合性，并在噪声和现实场景中表现有效。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于业务过程管理，也可推广到任何符号序列生成任务，推动了神经符号AI的发展。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of suffix prediction in Business Process
Management (BPM) by proposing a Neuro-Symbolic Predictive Process Monitoring
(PPM) approach that integrates data-driven learning with temporal logic-based
prior knowledge. While recent approaches leverage deep learning models for
suffix prediction, they often fail to satisfy even basic logical constraints
due to the absence of explicit integration of domain knowledge during training.
We propose a novel method to incorporate Linear Temporal Logic over finite
traces (LTLf) into the training process of autoregressive sequence predictors.
Our approach introduces a differentiable logical loss function, defined using a
soft approximation of LTLf semantics and the Gumbel-Softmax trick, which can be
combined with standard predictive losses. This ensures the model learns to
generate suffixes that are both accurate and logically consistent. Experimental
evaluation on three real-world datasets shows that our method improves suffix
prediction accuracy and compliance with temporal constraints. We also introduce
two variants of the logic loss (local and global) and demonstrate their
effectiveness under noisy and realistic settings. While developed in the
context of BPM, our framework is applicable to any symbolic sequence generation
task and contributes toward advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 闭环胰岛素输送系统(CLIDS)在1型糖尿病中的实际采用率较低，主要不是技术问题，而是行为、心理和社会障碍。需要评估LLM在健康行为改变中的说服对话能力

Method: 创建ChatCLIDS基准框架，包含专家验证的虚拟患者库（具有临床基础异质特征和真实采用障碍），模拟与配备多种循证说服策略的护士代理进行多轮互动，支持纵向咨询和对抗性社会影响场景

Result: 研究发现虽然更大、更具反思性的LLM能够随时间调整策略，但所有模型都难以克服抵抗，特别是在现实社会压力下

Conclusion: 结果突显了当前LLM在行为改变方面的关键局限性，为推进医疗保健及其他领域可信赖的说服性AI提供了高保真、可扩展的测试平台

Abstract: Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems (CLIDS) in type 1
diabetes remains low, driven not by technical failure, but by diverse
behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers. We introduce ChatCLIDS, the
first benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for
health behavior change. Our framework features a library of expert-validated
virtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and
realistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse
agents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies.
ChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social
influence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation. Our
findings reveal that while larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies
over time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under
realistic social pressure. These results highlight critical limitations of
current LLMs for behavior change, and offer a high-fidelity, scalable testbed
for advancing trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare and beyond.

Motivation: 解决蒙特卡洛反事实遗憾最小化(MCCFR)与深度神经网络结合时，在不同规模博弈中出现的尺度依赖挑战，包括非平稳目标分布偏移、动作支持崩溃等问题。

Method: 提出Robust Deep MCCFR框架，包含延迟更新的目标网络、均匀探索混合、方差感知训练目标和全面的诊断监控，通过系统消融研究验证组件有效性。

Result: 在Kuhn扑克上达到0.0628的最终可利用性（比经典框架提升60%），在Leduc扑克上达到0.2386的可利用性（提升23.5%），证明了选择性组件部署的重要性。

Conclusion: 神经MCCFR组件的有效性具有尺度依赖性，需要针对不同规模博弈采用选择性缓解策略，而非全面应用所有缓解措施，为更大规模博弈部署提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) has emerged as a
cornerstone algorithm for solving extensive-form games, but its integration
with deep neural networks introduces scale-dependent challenges that manifest
differently across game complexities. This paper presents a comprehensive
analysis of how neural MCCFR component effectiveness varies with game scale and
proposes an adaptive framework for selective component deployment. We identify
that theoretical risks such as nonstationary target distribution shifts, action
support collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias have
scale-dependent manifestation patterns, requiring different mitigation
strategies for small versus large games. Our proposed Robust Deep MCCFR
framework incorporates target networks with delayed updates, uniform
exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and comprehensive
diagnostic monitoring. Through systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc
Poker, we demonstrate scale-dependent component effectiveness and identify
critical component interactions. The best configuration achieves final
exploitability of 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker, representing a 60% improvement over the
classical framework (0.156). On the more complex Leduc Poker domain, selective
component usage achieves exploitability of 0.2386, a 23.5% improvement over the
classical framework (0.3703) and highlighting the importance of careful
component selection over comprehensive mitigation. Our contributions include:
(1) a formal theoretical analysis of risks in neural MCCFR, (2) a principled
mitigation framework with convergence guarantees, (3) comprehensive multi-scale
experimental validation revealing scale-dependent component interactions, and
(4) practical guidelines for deployment in larger games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型评估基准缺乏可控性和可扩展性，无法进行多维度系统分析，问题类型和格式单一，需要一种能够生成多样化逻辑推理问题的工具。

Method: SATQuest从合取范式(CNF)实例生成逻辑推理问题，沿三个正交维度构建问题：实例规模、问题类型和问题格式，采用随机化的基于SAT的问题生成和通过PySAT的客观答案验证。

Result: 评估发现LLM在逻辑推理方面存在显著局限性，特别是在超越熟悉的数学格式的泛化能力上。使用SATQuest奖励进行强化微调显著提高了目标任务性能并能泛化到更复杂的实例。

Conclusion: SATQuest展示了作为基础工具的潜力，是推进LLM逻辑推理能力的宝贵起点，同时揭示了跨格式适应的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
general reasoning capabilities. However, systematically evaluating and
enhancing these reasoning capabilities is challenging due to the lack of
controllable and scalable tools for fine-grained analysis. Existing benchmarks
and datasets often lack the necessary variable control for multi-dimensional,
systematic analysis and training, or have narrow problem types and formats. To
address these limitations, we introduce SATQuest, a systematic verifier
designed to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs by generating
diverse, Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from
Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) instances. SATQuest structures these problems
along three orthogonal dimensions: instance scale, problem type, and question
format, employing randomized, SAT-based problem generation and objective answer
verification via PySAT. This design mitigates memorization issues, allows for
nuanced insights into reasoning performance, and enables effective
reinforcement fine-tuning. Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using
SATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning,
particularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats. Furthermore,
we show that reinforcement fine-tuning with SATQuest rewards substantially
improves targeted task performance and generalizes to more complex instances,
while highlighting remaining challenges in cross-format adaptation. Through
these demonstrations, we showcase SATQuest's potential as a foundational tool
and a valuable starting point for advancing LLM logical reasoning.

Abstract: Cities today generate enormous streams of data from sensors, cameras, and
connected infrastructure. While this information offers unprecedented
opportunities to improve urban life, most existing systems struggle with scale,
latency, and fragmented insights. This work introduces a framework that blends
physics-informed machine learning, multimodal data fusion, and knowledge graph
representation with adaptive, rule-based intelligence powered by large language
models (LLMs). Physics-informed methods ground learning in real-world
constraints, ensuring predictions remain meaningful and consistent with
physical dynamics. Knowledge graphs act as the semantic backbone, integrating
heterogeneous sensor data into a connected, queryable structure. At the edge,
LLMs generate context-aware rules that adapt filtering and decision-making in
real time, enabling efficient operation even under constrained resources.
Together, these elements form a foundation for digital twin systems that go
beyond passive monitoring to provide actionable insights. By uniting
physics-based reasoning, semantic data fusion, and adaptive rule generation,
this approach opens new possibilities for creating responsive, trustworthy, and
sustainable smart infrastructures.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, multi stage hybrid intelligence framework for
pruning patent portfolios to identify high value assets for technology
transfer. Current patent valuation methods often rely on retrospective
indicators or manual, time intensive analysis. Our framework automates and
deepens this process by combining a Learning to Rank (LTR) model, which
evaluates patents against over 30 legal and commercial parameters, with a
unique "Need-Seed" agent-based system. The "Need Agent" uses Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to mine unstructured market and industry data, identifying
explicit technological needs. Concurrently, the "Seed Agent" employs fine tuned
Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze patent claims and map their
technological capabilities. The system generates a "Core Ontology Framework"
that matches high potential patents (Seeds) to documented market demands
(Needs), providing a strategic rationale for divestment decisions. We detail
the architecture, including a dynamic parameter weighting system and a crucial
Human in the-Loop (HITL) validation protocol, to ensure both adaptability and

Motivation: 解决超强机器学习(USML)系统中传统手工制作解释模板的可扩展性限制，实现自动化、可扩展的机器学习程序解释生成。

Method: 结合符号程序合成与大型语言模型(LLMs)，通过神经摘要技术自动生成逻辑程序的自然语言解释，替代手工模板方法。

Result: LENS生成的解释质量优于直接LLM提示和手工模板方法，但在人类学习实验中未观察到显著性能改进，可能因为LLM的全面响应对于简单问题反而让用户感到不知所措。

Conclusion: 为构建支持人类学习的有效USML系统提供了坚实基础，但需要进一步研究如何优化LLM响应以更好地支持人类学习过程。

Abstract: Ultra Strong Machine Learning (USML) refers to symbolic learning systems that
not only improve their own performance but can also teach their acquired
knowledge to quantifiably improve human performance. In this work, we present
LENS (Logic Programming Explanation via Neural Summarisation), a neuro-symbolic
method that combines symbolic program synthesis with large language models
(LLMs) to automate the explanation of machine-learned logic programs in natural
language. LENS addresses a key limitation of prior USML approaches by replacing
hand-crafted explanation templates with scalable automated generation. Through
systematic evaluation using multiple LLM judges and human validation, we
demonstrate that LENS generates superior explanations compared to direct LLM
prompting and hand-crafted templates. To investigate whether LENS can teach
transferable active learning strategies, we carried out a human learning
experiment across three related domains. Our results show no significant human
performance improvements, suggesting that comprehensive LLM responses may
overwhelm users for simpler problems rather than providing learning support.
Our work provides a solid foundation for building effective USML systems to
support human learning. The source code is available on:

TL;DR: CoreThink是一个基于通用符号推理方法的新型推理层，在工具调用、代码生成和规划任务中表现出色，无需微调即可在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如测试时缩放、监督微调和强化学习）在LLM性能提升上存在收益递减问题，需要开发新的推理技术来突破性能瓶颈。

Method: 采用通用符号推理（General Symbolics）方法，构建了专门针对工具调用、代码生成和规划三个关键用例的推理层，完全避免微调和训练成本。

Result: 在7个基准测试中表现优异：Livecodebench v6达到66.66%、Instruction-Following Evals达到89%、ARC-AGI-2达到24.4%，基于该技术的智能编码IDE在SWE-Bench Lite上达到62.3%的准确率。

Conclusion: CoreThink推理层提供了纯粹的性能提升，确保推理任务准确率不会受到负面影响，为推理密集型应用场景提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce CoreThink, a state-of-the-art Reasoning Layer built upon a novel
reasoning method called General Symbolics. This approach diverges from
reasoning paradigms such as test-time scaling, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). CoreThink General
Symbolic Reasoner (GSR) is specifically structured around three key use cases:
tool-calling, code generation, and planning, demonstrating exemplary
performance across a total of seven benchmarks in their respective areas.
Notably, we are achieving SOTA scores of 66.66\% on Livecodebench v6, 89\% on
Instruction-Following Evals, and 24.4\% on ARC-AGI-2. We also present an
agentic coding IDE, developed using the principles of General Symbolics, which
achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.3\% on \texttt{SWE-Bench Lite}. We
are able to achieve these improvements without any finetuning or training
costs. Our Reasoning Layer is designed to provide a pure performance uplift,
ensuring that a model's accuracy on reasoning tasks is never negatively
impacted. We argue that incumbent methods will eventually lead to diminishing
returns in LLM performance, necessitating the development of new reasoning
techniques. This technical report details our approach at a high level and the

TL;DR: ReaL-TG是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过微调大语言模型来在时序图上进行可解释的链接预测，使用结果奖励机制鼓励模型从图结构中探索推理策略并生成解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时序图神经网络虽然性能强但缺乏可解释性，且无法应用于未见过的图而不重新训练。现有的大语言模型方法大多局限于静态图或小型合成时序图，且缺乏对推理轨迹质量的评估。

Method: 提出ReaL-TG强化学习框架，使用结果奖励机制微调大语言模型，使其能够从图结构中自我探索推理策略并生成直接支持预测的解释。同时提出结合排序指标和LLM-as-a-Judge系统的新评估协议。

Result: 通过微调Qwen3-4B得到的ReaL-TG-4B在排序指标上优于包括GPT-5 mini在内的更大规模前沿大语言模型，同时生成高质量的推理解释，得到LLM评判系统和人工评估的确认。

Conclusion: ReaL-TG框架成功解决了时序图链接预测中的可解释性和泛化性问题，证明了强化学习微调大语言模型在复杂图推理任务中的有效性，并为评估LLM生成的推理轨迹提供了新方法。

Abstract: Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning,
requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones.
Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve
strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen
graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large
language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to
static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of
reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced
Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that
fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs.
ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning
strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly
justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning
traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an
LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the
impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning
Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier
LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality
explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various reasoning and generation tasks. However, their proficiency in complex
causal reasoning, discovery, and estimation remains an area of active
development, often hindered by issues like hallucination, reliance on spurious
correlations, and difficulties in handling nuanced, domain-specific, or
personalized causal relationships. Multi-agent systems, leveraging the
collaborative or specialized abilities of multiple LLM-based agents, are
emerging as a powerful paradigm to address these limitations. This review paper
explores the burgeoning field of causal multi-agent LLMs. We examine how these
systems are designed to tackle different facets of causality, including causal
reasoning and counterfactual analysis, causal discovery from data, and the
estimation of causal effects. We delve into the diverse architectural patterns
and interaction protocols employed, from pipeline-based processing and debate
frameworks to simulation environments and iterative refinement loops.
Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation methodologies, benchmarks, and diverse
application domains where causal multi-agent LLMs are making an impact,
including scientific discovery, healthcare, fact-checking, and personalized
systems. Finally, we highlight the persistent challenges, open research
questions, and promising future directions in this synergistic field, aiming to
provide a comprehensive overview of its current state and potential trajectory.

Motivation: LLM代理作为用户代表操作和分析数据的工作负载正在快速增长，但现有数据系统无法高效处理代理推测产生的大量低效查询

Method: 分析代理推测的四个特征（规模、异构性、冗余性和可引导性），提出面向代理优先的数据系统架构研究机会

Result: 识别了代理工作负载对数据系统的挑战，提出了包括新查询接口、查询处理技术和代理内存存储在内的研究方向

Conclusion: 数据系统需要从根本上重新设计以原生支持LLM代理工作负载，利用代理推测的特性来优化系统性能

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, acting on their users' behalf to
manipulate and analyze data, are likely to become the dominant workload for
data systems in the future. When working with data, agents employ a
high-throughput process of exploration and solution formulation for the given
task, one we call agentic speculation. The sheer volume and inefficiencies of
agentic speculation can pose challenges for present-day data systems. We argue
that data systems need to adapt to more natively support agentic workloads. We
take advantage of the characteristics of agentic speculation that we identify,
i.e., scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, and steerability - to outline a number
of new research opportunities for a new agent-first data systems architecture,
ranging from new query interfaces, to new query processing techniques, to new
agentic memory stores.

Abstract: Inductive reasoning enables humans to infer abstract rules from limited
examples and apply them to novel situations. In this work, we compare an
LLM-based hypothesis search framework with direct program generation approaches
on few-shot rule induction tasks. Our findings show that hypothesis search
achieves performance comparable to humans, while direct program generation
falls notably behind. An error analysis reveals key bottlenecks in hypothesis
generation and suggests directions for advancing program induction methods.
Overall, this paper underscores the potential of LLM-based hypothesis search
for modeling inductive reasoning and the challenges in building more efficient
systems.

Abstract: By uncovering the contrast between Artificial Intelligence and Natural-born
Intelligence as a computational process, we define closed computing and open
computing, and implement open computing within chemical reactions. This
involves forming a mixture and invalidation of the computational process and
the execution environment, which are logically distinct, and coalescing both to
create a system that adjusts fluctuations. We model chemical reactions by
considering the computation as the chemical reaction and the execution
environment as the degree of aggregation of molecules that interact with the
reactive environment. This results in a chemical reaction that progresses while
repeatedly clustering and de-clustering, where concentration no longer holds
significant meaning. Open computing is segmented into Token computing, which
focuses on the individual behavior of chemical molecules, and Type computing,
which focuses on normative behavior. Ultimately, both are constructed as an
interplay between the two. In this system, Token computing demonstrates
self-organizing critical phenomena, while Type computing exhibits quantum
logic. Through their interplay, the recruitment of fluctuations is realized,
giving rise to interactions between quantum logical subspaces corresponding to
quantum coherence across different Hilbert spaces. As a result, spike waves are
formed, enabling signal transmission. This occurrence may be termed
quantum-like coherence, implying the source of enzymes responsible for
controlling spike waves and biochemical rhythms.

Abstract: We introduce the Block Rearrangement Problem (BRaP), a challenging component
of large warehouse management which involves rearranging storage blocks within

search problem. Building on intuitions from sliding puzzle problems, we propose
five search-based solution algorithms, leveraging joint configuration space
search, classical planning, multi-agent pathfinding, and expert heuristics. We
evaluate the five approaches empirically for plan quality and scalability.
Despite the exponential relation between search space size and block number,
our methods demonstrate efficiency in creating rearrangement plans for deeply
buried blocks in up to 80x80 grids.

Motivation: 现有的游戏基准测试缺乏多样性，很少评估代理完成整个故事线的能力，特别是冒险游戏中复杂的叙事驱动交互带来了额外挑战。

Method: 提出了FlashAdventure基准测试、CUA-as-a-Judge自动游戏评估器，以及COAST代理框架，该框架利用长期线索记忆来更好地规划和解决顺序任务。

Abstract: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital
environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their
varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through
complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack
diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To
address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based
adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the
observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier
gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay
evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to
better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents
struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by
bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy
between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts
to narrow this divide.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习工具使用方法存在碎片化、同步执行瓶颈和有限的可扩展性，阻碍了社区采用和算法创新，需要统一的框架来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出VerlTool框架，包含四个关键贡献：与VeRL的上游对齐、通过标准化API的统一工具管理、异步rollout执行消除同步瓶颈，以及模块化插件架构支持快速工具集成。

Result: 在6个ARLT领域（数学推理、知识问答、SQL生成、视觉推理、网络搜索和软件工程）实现了竞争性性能，异步执行获得近2倍加速，同时提供统一的训练基础设施。

Conclusion: VerlTool为工具增强的强化学习研究提供了可扩展的基础，通过模块化设计显著降低了开发开销，支持多模态观察和多轮交互，超越了单轮RLVR范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated
success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to
single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic
Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address
multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases
that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited
extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community
adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and
modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design
principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment
with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool
management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code
execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous
rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating
synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating
competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as
multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video),
extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on
mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web
search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to
specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The
modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only
lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and
providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is

Conclusion: Robix作为一个端到端框架，成功实现了机器人推理、规划和交互的统一，为构建更智能的机器人系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task
planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language
architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot
system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level
controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to
follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally
with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel
capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and
context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix
leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training
strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning
abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and
task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot
interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3)
reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon
task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both
open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in
interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse
instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and
interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery

Abstract: This note illustrates how a variety of causal abstraction arXiv:1707.00819

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商平台中产品列表的SKU匹配是一个长期挑战，特别是当缺乏明确标识符且产品名称在不同平台差异很大时。传统的基于规则和关键词相似度的方法经常因忽略品牌、规格或套装配置的细微差别而误分类产品。

Method: 提出Q2K多智能体框架：1)推理智能体生成针对性消歧问题；2)知识智能体通过聚焦网络搜索解决问题；3)去重智能体重用已验证的推理轨迹以减少冗余并确保一致性。还包含人工干预机制来优化不确定情况。

Result: 在真实消费品数据集上的实验表明，Q2K超越了强基线方法，在困难场景（如套装识别和品牌来源消歧）中实现了更高的准确性和鲁棒性。通过重用检索到的推理而非重复搜索，Q2K在准确性和效率之间取得了平衡。

Conclusion: Q2K提供了一个可扩展且可解释的产品集成解决方案，通过多智能体LLM框架有效解决了SKU映射问题，在保持高效的同时显著提升了匹配准确性。

Abstract: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit
(SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit
identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule
based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by
overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle
configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge
(Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for
reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates
targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via
focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated
reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the
loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world
consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving
higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle
identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning
instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency,
offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.

Conclusion: AnchorRAG通过多智能体协作框架提高了检索的鲁棒性，减轻了模糊或错误锚点的影响，为开放世界检索增强生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning. However, their dependence on static
training corpora makes them prone to factual errors and knowledge gaps.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating
external knowledge sources, especially structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which
provide explicit semantics and efficient retrieval. Existing KG-based RAG
approaches, however, generally assume that anchor entities are accessible to
initiate graph traversal, which limits their robustness in open world settings
where accurate linking between the query and the entity is unreliable. To
overcome this limitation, we propose AnchorRAG, a novel multi-agent
collaboration framework for open-world RAG without the predefined anchor
entities. Specifically, a predictor agent dynamically identifies candidate
anchor entities by aligning user query terms with KG nodes and initializes
independent retriever agents to conduct parallel multi-hop explorations from
each candidate. Then a supervisor agent formulates the iterative retrieval
strategy for these retriever agents and synthesizes the resulting knowledge
paths to generate the final answer. This multi-agent collaboration framework
improves retrieval robustness and mitigates the impact of ambiguous or
erroneous anchors. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate
that AnchorRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines and establishes new
state-of-the-art results on the real-world question answering tasks.

Motivation: 解决操作系统调度器与应用程序需求之间的语义鸿沟问题，传统内核策略无法理解应用特定需求导致性能不佳

Method: 采用MCP服务器架构，包含工作负载分析引擎、调度策略库和执行验证器，通过多智能体系统分析工作负载并合成eBPF调度策略

Result: 实现了最高1.79倍的性能改进，相比简单智能体方法成本降低13倍，同时保持高成功率

Conclusion: SchedCP通过弥合语义鸿沟，使系统优化民主化，为创建真正自优化的应用感知操作系统迈出了重要一步

Abstract: Operating system schedulers suffer from a fundamental semantic gap, where
kernel policies fail to understand application-specific needs, leading to
suboptimal performance. We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables
fully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently
optimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that
the challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled
control plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning ("what to
optimize") from the system's role of execution ("how to observe and act").
Implemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable
interface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving
Scheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all
AI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic
analysis.
  We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent
system that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling
policies, and deploys them via the sched\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation
shows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x
cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high
success rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level
system optimization and represents a step towards creating truly
self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems. The code is open-sourced

undergoing a transformative shift. However, conventional text-to-video models
are typically constrained by high computational costs.
  In this study, we propose Video-Generation-Team (VGTeam), a novel slide show
video generation system designed to redefine the video creation pipeline
through the integration of large language models (LLMs). VGTeam is composed of
a suite of communicative agents, each responsible for a distinct aspect of
video generation, such as scriptwriting, scene creation, and audio design.
These agents operate collaboratively within a chat tower workflow, transforming
user-provided textual prompts into coherent, slide-style narrative videos.
  By emulating the sequential stages of traditional video production, VGTeam
achieves remarkable improvements in both efficiency and scalability, while
substantially reducing computational overhead. On average, the system generates
videos at a cost of only $0.103, with a successful generation rate of 98.4%.
Importantly, this framework maintains a high degree of creative fidelity and
customization.
  The implications of VGTeam are far-reaching. It democratizes video production
by enabling broader access to high-quality content creation without the need
for extensive resources. Furthermore, it highlights the transformative
potential of language models in creative domains and positions VGTeam as a
pioneering system for next-generation content creation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文评估了结果奖励模型(ORMs)在Text-to-SQL任务中的效果，相比传统的Best-of-N和Majority Voting方法，ORMs通过语义正确性评估显著提升了SQL查询的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在生成复杂SQL查询时仍难以准确对齐用户意图和数据库模式，传统的测试时策略依赖表层启发式方法，需要更有效的语义对齐机制。

Method: 提出了训练ORMs的框架，为生成的SQL输出分配基于语义正确性的效用分数，在BIRD和SPIDER基准上对Qwen2、Granite3、Llama3等开源LLMs进行微调。

Result: ORMs在BIRD和SPIDER基准上分别比ex-BoN提升了4.33%和2.10%的执行准确率，比Maj提升了2.91%和0.93%，在简单查询上表现竞争性且能从更多候选查询中获益。

Conclusion: ORMs是Text-to-SQL任务中有效的启发式方法，特别适合已经与SQL生成对齐的模型，能够更好地将模型预测与用户意图对齐。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL
queries, has significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language
Models (LLMs), broadening database accessibility for a wide range of users.
Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still
struggle with complex queries that require precise alignment between user
intent and the database schema. To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as
Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the
assumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple
attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting
either the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or
the most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models
(ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic
correctness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model
predictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL
remains largely underexplored.
  In this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare
them with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the
Text-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks,
finetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3
model families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving
execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and
+2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that
finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields
superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve
competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number
of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.

TL;DR: GenQPM是一种基于深度生成模型的定量预测监控方法，通过模式分类和保形推理为多模态随机系统提供统计保证的模式特定预测区间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QPM方法在处理多模态动态系统时过于保守，无法提供有意义的模式特定满意度信息，需要解决多模态系统下的预测监控问题

Method: 利用基于分数的扩散模型近似系统概率多模态动态，通过模式分类器划分轨迹，对每个模式应用保形推理生成模式特定预测区间

Result: 在智能体导航和自动驾驶任务基准测试中，GenQPM产生的预测区间比模式无关基线方法显著更信息丰富（更不保守）

Conclusion: GenQPM方法有效解决了多模态随机系统的定量预测监控问题，通过模式特定的预测区间提供了更精确和有用的运行时预测

Abstract: We consider the problem of quantitative predictive monitoring (QPM) of
stochastic systems, i.e., predicting at runtime the degree of satisfaction of a
desired temporal logic property from the current state of the system. Since
computational efficiency is key to enable timely intervention against predicted
violations, several state-of-the-art QPM approaches rely on fast
machine-learning surrogates to provide prediction intervals for the
satisfaction values, using conformal inference to offer statistical guarantees.
However, these QPM methods suffer when the monitored agent exhibits multi-modal
dynamics, whereby certain modes may yield high satisfaction values while others
critically violate the property. Existing QPM methods are mode-agnostic and so
would yield overly conservative and uninformative intervals that lack
meaningful mode-specific satisfaction information. To address this problem, we
present GenQPM, a method that leverages deep generative models, specifically
score-based diffusion models, to reliably approximate the probabilistic and
multi-modal system dynamics without requiring explicit model access. GenQPM
employs a mode classifier to partition the predicted trajectories by dynamical
mode. For each mode, we then apply conformal inference to produce statistically
valid, mode-specific prediction intervals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
GenQPM on a benchmark of agent navigation and autonomous driving tasks,
resulting in prediction intervals that are significantly more informative (less
conservative) than mode-agnostic baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种无需额外训练的CAD组件检索框架，通过错误笔记本和RAG技术改善现有大模型的检索性能，在GPT-4o等专有模型上实现了显著的精度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAD组件规格检索对自动化设计验证至关重要，但直接使用LLMs/VLMs遇到输入长度限制和性能不佳问题，且对专有模型进行微调需要大量计算资源或无法访问。

Method: 提出一种无需训练的检索框架，通过错误笔记本（收集历史错误思维链和更正）结合RAG技术，从错误笔记本中检索相关记录并将其整合到推理过程中。

Result: 在GPT-4o和Gemini等专有模型上进行实验，GPT-4o（Omni）在人类偏好数据集上实现了绝对精度23.4%的提升。消融研究证明思维链推理在复杂场景（部件数>10）中特别有效。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理含有长非自然语言元数据的3D模型，为工程应用提供了价值，且无需额外训练就能显著提升现有大模型的CAD组件检索性能。

Abstract: Effective specification-aware part retrieval within complex CAD assemblies is
essential for automated design verification and downstream engineering tasks.
However, directly using LLMs/VLMs to this task presents some challenges: the
input sequences may exceed model token limits, and even after processing,
performance remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs/VLMs requires
significant computational resources, and for many high-performing general-use
proprietary models (e.g., GPT or Gemini), fine-tuning access is not available.
In this paper, we propose a novel part retrieval framework that requires no
extra training, but using Error Notebooks + RAG for refined prompt engineering
to help improve the existing general model's retrieval performance. The
construction of Error Notebooks consists of two steps: (1) collecting
historical erroneous CoTs and their incorrect answers, and (2) connecting these
CoTs through reflective corrections until the correct solutions are obtained.
As a result, the Error Notebooks serve as a repository of tasks along with
their corrected CoTs and final answers. RAG is then employed to retrieve
specification-relevant records from the Error Notebooks and incorporate them
into the inference process. Another major contribution of our work is a
human-in-the-loop CAD dataset, which is used to evaluate our method. In
addition, the engineering value of our novel framework lies in its ability to
effectively handle 3D models with lengthy, non-natural language metadata.
Experiments with proprietary models, including GPT-4o and the Gemini series,
show substantial gains, with GPT-4o (Omni) achieving up to a 23.4% absolute
accuracy improvement on the human preference dataset. Moreover, ablation
studies confirm that CoT reasoning provides benefits especially in challenging
cases with higher part counts (>10).

Motivation: 现有方法难以收集真正反映研究者关注点的前沿研究问题，导致对研究代理能力的评估不够准确。

Method: 提出多智能体分层任务生成(MAHTG)系统，从研讨会记录中提取研究灵感并转化为高质量研究任务。

Result: 构建了涵盖12个学科的10,000+研究任务，评估显示当前最先进的研究代理在该基准上表现存在明显差距。

Conclusion: DeepResearch Arena提供了一个更真实的研究环境基准，能有效评估研究代理的能力，并为未来发展提供指导。

Abstract: Deep research agents have attracted growing attention for their potential to
orchestrate multi-stage research workflows, spanning literature synthesis,
methodological design, and empirical verification. Despite these strides,
evaluating their research capability faithfully is rather challenging due to
the difficulty of collecting frontier research questions that genuinely capture
researchers' attention and intellectual curiosity. To address this gap, we
introduce DeepResearch Arena, a benchmark grounded in academic seminars that
capture rich expert discourse and interaction, better reflecting real-world
research environments and reducing the risk of data leakage. To automatically
construct DeepResearch Arena, we propose a Multi-Agent Hierarchical Task
Generation (MAHTG) system that extracts research-worthy inspirations from
seminar transcripts. The MAHTG system further translates research-worthy
inspirations into high-quality research tasks, ensuring the traceability of
research task formulation while filtering noise. With the MAHTG system, we
curate DeepResearch Arena with over 10,000 high-quality research tasks from
over 200 academic seminars, spanning 12 disciplines, such as literature,
history, and science. Our extensive evaluation shows that DeepResearch Arena
presents substantial challenges for current state-of-the-art agents, with clear
performance gaps observed across different models.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the practice of science. Machine
learning and large language models (LLMs) can generate hypotheses at a scale
and speed far exceeding traditional methods, offering the potential to
accelerate discovery across diverse fields. However, the abundance of
hypotheses introduces a critical challenge: without scalable and reliable
mechanisms for verification, scientific progress risks being hindered rather
than being advanced. In this article, we trace the historical development of
scientific discovery, examine how AI is reshaping established practices for
scientific discovery, and review the principal approaches, ranging from
data-driven methods and knowledge-aware neural architectures to symbolic
reasoning frameworks and LLM agents. While these systems can uncover patterns
and propose candidate laws, their scientific value ultimately depends on
rigorous and transparent verification, which we argue must be the cornerstone
of AI-assisted discovery.

Motivation: 服务生态系统治理面临复杂多变的社会环境和协作关系，传统基于预定义规则的场景分析方法存在信息有限、影响因素多、社会元素难以量化等挑战，限制了场景生成的质量和效率。

Result: 在ProgrammableWeb数据集上的实验表明，该方法能更高效地生成更准确的场景，为服务生态系统治理相关的实验系统构建提供了创新有效的方式。

Conclusion: 提出的多代理协作场景生成方法有效解决了服务生态系统场景生成的挑战，提高了生成质量和效率，为复杂社会环境的实验系统构建提供了新思路。

Abstract: As the social environment is growing more complex and collaboration is
deepening, factors affecting the healthy development of service ecosystem are
constantly changing and diverse, making its governance a crucial research
issue. Applying the scenario analysis method and conducting scenario rehearsals
by constructing an experimental system before managers make decisions, losses
caused by wrong decisions can be largely avoided. However, it relies on
predefined rules to construct scenarios and faces challenges such as limited
information, a large number of influencing factors, and the difficulty of
measuring social elements. These challenges limit the quality and efficiency of
generating social and uncertain scenarios for the service ecosystem. Therefore,
we propose a scenario generator design method, which adaptively coordinates
three Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents that autonomously optimize
experimental schemes to construct an experimental system and generate high
quality scenarios. Specifically, the Environment Agent (EA) generates social
environment including extremes, the Social Agent (SA) generates social
collaboration structure, and the Planner Agent (PA) couples task-role
relationships and plans task solutions. These agents work in coordination, with
the PA adjusting the experimental scheme in real time by perceiving the states
of each agent and these generating scenarios. Experiments on the
ProgrammableWeb dataset illustrate our method generates more accurate scenarios
more efficiently, and innovatively provides an effective way for service
ecosystem governance related experimental system construction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在产生正确答案时依赖错误或无关推理路径的问题，提高高风险领域的可信度

Method: 引入自动化操作级反事实干预（如运算符替换），在训练中惩罚逻辑无效但输出相同的模型，仅需每个样本一次额外前向传播

Result: 在算术、逻辑推理和规划任务中，CSR相比标准微调和过程监督将忠实度提升高达70个百分点，准确率损失很小

Conclusion: CSR是轻量级有效的训练方法，能显著提升模型推理忠实度，且具有良好的泛化性和与其他推理方法的协同效应

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce correct answers while relying on
flawed or irrelevant reasoning traces, undermining their trustworthiness in
high-stakes domains. We propose Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization
(CSR), a lightweight training objective that enforces dependence between
intermediate reasoning and final outputs. CSR introduces automated,
operator-level counterfactual interventions (e.g., swapping "+" with "-")
during training and penalizes models that preserve the same answer under
logically invalid traces. This requires only one additional forward pass per
sample. To measure faithfulness, we introduce Counterfactual Outcome
Sensitivity (COS), which quantifies the impact of such perturbations on model
predictions. Across structured reasoning tasks - arithmetic (GSM8K), logical
deduction (PrOntoQA), and planning (Blocks World) - CSR improves faithfulness
by up to 70 percentage points over standard fine-tuning and process
supervision, with only minor accuracy loss. The learned sensitivity generalizes
to larger models and synergizes with inference-time methods such as
self-consistency. A pilot study on HellaSwag further demonstrates that
extending CSR with semantic perturbations can enhance faithfulness in
commonsense reasoning.

Motivation: 随着AI在航空航天和应急响应等安全关键领域应用日益普遍，需要解决自主决策的伦理问题，确保决策的可靠性和可证明性，特别是在涉及人命安全的情况下。

Method: 提出了一种结构化决策框架，通过引入Enabler代理、级别和场景等概念来实现自主决策。在灾害管理领域进行实现，并与仅依靠判断的系统以及具有灾害经验的人类操作员（受害者、志愿者和利益相关方）进行性能评估。

Conclusion: 这些结果证明了结构化决策框架在安全关键领域构建更可靠自主AI应用方面的潜力，为负责任AI的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: With artificial intelligence (AI) being applied to bring autonomy to
decision-making in safety-critical domains such as the ones typified in the
aerospace and emergency-response services, there has been a call to address the
ethical implications of structuring those decisions, so they remain reliable
and justifiable when human lives are at stake. This paper contributes to
addressing the challenge of decision-making by proposing a structured
decision-making framework as a foundational step towards responsible AI. The
proposed structured decision-making framework is implemented in autonomous
decision-making, specifically within disaster management. By introducing
concepts of Enabler agents, Levels and Scenarios, the proposed framework's
performance is evaluated against systems relying solely on judgement-based
insights, as well as human operators who have disaster experience: victims,
volunteers, and stakeholders. The results demonstrate that the structured
decision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently
accurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based
systems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms
human operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios. These
findings demonstrate the promise of the structured decision-making framework
for building more reliable autonomous AI applications in safety-critical
contexts.

Motivation: 网络AI代理的高速、大规模访问可能导致服务过载和窃取，而传统的CAPTCHA等防御措施无法有效防止这些代理。

Method: 设计了叫停门（Throttling Gates）框架，使用需要多跳推理的文本谜题（rebus-based Reasoning Gates）作为挑战，通过增加代理的词汇生成成本来实现计算不对称性。

Result: 框架实现了9.2倍的计算不对称性，响应生成成本显著高于生成成本。在实际网站和MCP服务器上部署并通过真实网络代理评估。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效叫停恶意网络代理，但需要考虑实际部署的限制和环境影响。

Abstract: AI web agents use Internet resources at far greater speed, scale, and
complexity -- changing how users and services interact. Deployed maliciously or
erroneously, these agents could overload content providers. At the same time,
web agents can bypass CAPTCHAs and other defenses by mimicking user behavior or
flood authentication systems with fake accounts. Yet providers must protect
their services and content from denial-of-service attacks and scraping by web
agents. In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on
agents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling.
We start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that
are asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a
common component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve
reasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However,
we find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates
fails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based
Reasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over
world knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable
generation and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework
achieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x
higher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning
gates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate
with real-world web agents. Finally, we discuss the limitations and
environmental impact of real-world deployment of our framework.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，有些用户尝试通过"脱獌"技术利用模型进行恶意活动。虽然现有研究能够防御脱獌攻击，但其准确机制仍不明确。

Method: 提出了一种新的神经元级解释方法，将模型内部表示投影到更一致和可解释的词汇空间。通过调整安全相关神经元的激活来控制模型行为，并基于此提出SafeTuning细调策略。

Result: 调整安全相关神经元激活可有效控制模型行为，平均攻击成功率超过97%。SafeTuning在多个LLM上一致降低攻击成功率，超过所有四个基线防御方法。

Conclusion: 这些发现为理解和防御脱獌攻击提供了新的视角，通过神经元级利用可以有效提升模型的安全性和稳健性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting attention in various
applications. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to
exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of
controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation, a technique known
as "Jailbreak." While some studies have achieved defenses against jailbreak
attacks by modifying output distributions or detecting harmful content, the
exact rationale still remains elusive. In this work, we present a novel
neuron-level interpretability method that focuses on the role of safety-related
knowledge neurons. Unlike existing approaches, our method projects the model's
internal representation into a more consistent and interpretable vocabulary
space. We then show that adjusting the activation of safety-related neurons can
effectively control the model's behavior with a mean ASR higher than 97%.
Building on this insight, we propose SafeTuning, a fine-tuning strategy that
reinforces safety-critical neurons to improve model robustness against
jailbreaks. SafeTuning consistently reduces attack success rates across
multiple LLMs and outperforms all four baseline defenses. These findings offer
a new perspective on understanding and defending against jailbreak attacks.

Conclusion: 该技术为大规模分析在线服务隐私实践提供了可能性，是审计网络和互联网的有前景方向，所有数据集和源代码已开源供重用

Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read
the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites, despite claiming
otherwise, due to the practical difficulty in comprehending them. The mist of
data privacy practices forms a major barrier for user-centred Web approaches,
and for data sharing and reusing in an agentic world. Existing research
proposed methods for using formal languages and reasoning for verifying the
compliance of a specified policy, as a potential cure for ignoring privacy
policies. However, a critical gap remains in the creation or acquisition of
such formal policies at scale. We present a semantic-centric approach for using
state-of-the-art large language models (LLM), to automatically identify key
information about privacy practices from privacy policies, and construct
$\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$, knowledge graph with grounding from Data Privacy
Vocabulary (DPV) for privacy practices, to support downstream tasks. Along with
the pipeline, the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ for the top-100 popular
websites is also released as a public resource, by using the pipeline for
analysis. We also demonstrate how the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ can be used
to support downstream tasks by constructing formal policy representations such
as Open Digital Right Language (ODRL) or perennial semantic Data Terms of Use
(psDToU). To evaluate the technology capability, we enriched the Policy-IE
dataset by employing legal experts to create custom annotations. We benchmarked
the performance of different large language models for our pipeline and
verified their capabilities. Overall, they shed light on the possibility of
large-scale analysis of online services' privacy practices, as a promising
direction to audit the Web and the Internet. We release all datasets and source
code as public resources to facilitate reuse and improvement.

Method: CSA方法结合游戏论的用户反应预测、细粒度风险边界发现和可解释推理控制，将安全转化为建立信任的过程。在Oyster-I (Oy1)模型中实现

Result: Oy1在开放模型中达到最先进的安全水平，同时保持高通用能力。在Constructive Benchmark上展示出接近GPT-5的建设性参与度，在Strata-Sword越狱数据集上具有接近GPT-o1水平的鲁棒性

Conclusion: CSA通过从拒绝优先转向引导优先的安全方法，重新定义了模型与用户的关系，旨在构建不仅安全而且有意义的帮助系统

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent
harmful content generation. Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks
posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and
relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come
from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g.,
self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly
influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat,
escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce
Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects
against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe
and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic
anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and
interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process.
Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high
general capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong
constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the
Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from
refusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user
relationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully
helpful. We release Oy1, code, and the benchmark to support responsible,
user-centered AI.

TL;DR: 研究发现人类教师对话在长度、提问和反馈方面显著优于AI模拟对话，人类对话呈现认知引导的多样化教学循环，而AI对话则表现出结构简化和行为趋同的信息传递模式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究AI模拟对话与真实人类教师对话在结构和行为上的差异，以了解当前大语言模型在生成教学丰富互动方面的局限性

Method: 使用IRF编码方案和认知网络分析(ENA)对AI模拟和真实人类辅导对话进行定量比较

Result: 人类对话在话语长度、提问行为和一般反馈行为方面显著优于AI对话；人类对话呈现"提问-事实回应-反馈"的教学循环，体现教学指导和学生驱动思维，而AI对话呈现"解释-简单回应"的简化信息传递模式

Conclusion: 揭示了当前AI生成辅导对话的关键局限性，为设计和评估更具教学效果的生成式教育对话系统提供了实证指导

Abstract: Heuristic and scaffolded teacher-student dialogues are widely regarded as
critical for fostering students' higher-order thinking and deep learning.
However, large language models (LLMs) currently face challenges in generating
pedagogically rich interactions. This study systematically investigates the
structural and behavioral differences between AI-simulated and authentic human
tutoring dialogues. We conducted a quantitative comparison using an
Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis
(ENA). The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to
their AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and
general feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a
fundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more
cognitively guided and diverse, centered around a "question-factual
response-feedback" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and
student-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of
structural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an
"explanation-simplistic response" loop that is essentially a simple information
transfer between the teacher and student. These findings illuminate key
limitations in current AI-generated tutoring and provide empirical guidance for
designing and evaluating more pedagogically effective generative educational
dialogue systems.

TL;DR: DSP是一种异步在线强化学习框架，通过动态推测规划实现无损加速，在保持性能的同时显著降低推理成本，无需额外预部署准备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型代理面临部署挑战，包括延迟过高和推理成本昂贵。现有加速方法要么性能保真度不足，要么需要大量离线训练，要么运营成本过高，且缺乏用户对加速与性能权衡的控制。

Method: 提出动态推测规划(DSP)框架，使用异步在线强化学习，通过优化端到端延迟与美元成本的联合目标，允许用户通过单一参数调整系统在响应速度和运营成本之间的权衡。

Result: 在两个标准代理基准测试中，DSP实现了与最快无损加速方法相当的效率，同时将总成本降低30%，不必要成本降低高达60%。

Conclusion: DSP提供了一种无需预部署准备的低成本无损加速解决方案，通过灵活的权衡控制机制，为大型语言模型代理的实际部署提供了有效的性能优化方法。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable success in complex tasks propelling widespread
adoption, large language-model-based agents still face critical deployment
challenges due to prohibitive latency and inference costs. While recent work
has explored various methods to accelerate inference, existing approaches
suffer from significant limitations: they either fail to preserve performance
fidelity, require extensive offline training of router modules, or incur
excessive operational costs. Moreover, they provide minimal user control over
the tradeoff between acceleration and other performance metrics. To address
these gaps, we introduce Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous
online reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration
with substantially reduced costs without requiring additional pre-deployment
preparation. DSP explicitly optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end
latency against dollar cost, allowing practitioners to adjust a single
parameter that steers the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or
any point along this continuum. Experiments on two standard agent benchmarks
demonstrate that DSP achieves comparable efficiency to the fastest lossless
acceleration method while reducing total cost by 30% and unnecessary cost up to
60%. Our code and data are available through
https://github.com/guanyilin428/Dynamic-Speculative-Planning.

TL;DR: EigenBench是一个无需真实标签的黑盒方法，通过模型间相互评估来量化语言模型与给定价值体系的对齐程度，使用EigenTrust算法聚合评估结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI与人类价值观对齐缺乏定量度量标准的问题，为价值对齐提供可比较的基准测试方法。

Method: 给定模型集合、价值体系宪法和场景数据集，让模型相互评估输出，使用EigenTrust算法聚合评估结果生成对齐分数向量。

Result: EigenBench能够量化模型的价值对齐程度，研究发现大部分方差由提示词解释，但仍有小部分残差反映模型本身的倾向性。

Conclusion: EigenBench为价值对齐提供了有效的定量评估框架，能够区分模型固有倾向和提示词影响，是解决AI价值观对齐问题的重要工具。

Abstract: Aligning AI with human values is a pressing unsolved problem. To address the
lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a
black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given
an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset
of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's
alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges
the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are
aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a
weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground
truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges
may disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether
EigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that
most of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual
quantifies the disposition of the model itself.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了mFARM多维度公平性评估框架和FAB公平-准确性平衡评分，用于评估医疗场景中LLM的偏见问题，并在两个大规模医疗基准测试上验证了四种开源LLM的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性评估方法在医疗高风险环境中存在不足，使用过于简化的指标，忽略了医疗危害的多维性，且可能促使模型因临床惰性而显得公平但实际不准确。

Method: 构建了两个大规模受控基准测试（ED-Triage和Opioid Analgesic Recommendation），包含5万多个提示和12种种族×性别变体；提出了mFARM多维度公平性评估框架，评估分配性、稳定性和潜在性三个维度的差异，并聚合为mFARM分数；还提出了FAB分数来评估公平性与预测准确性之间的权衡。

Result: 评估了四种开源LLM及其微调版本，发现mFARM指标在各种设置下能更有效地捕捉细微偏见；大多数模型在不同量化水平下保持稳健的mFARM性能，但在上下文减少时性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 提出的mFARM框架能更好地评估医疗LLM的公平性问题，基准测试和评估代码已公开以促进医疗AI对齐研究。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes medical
settings poses a critical AI alignment challenge, as models can inherit and
amplify societal biases, leading to significant disparities. Existing fairness
evaluation methods fall short in these contexts as they typically use
simplistic metrics that overlook the multi-dimensional nature of medical harms.
This also promotes models that are fair only because they are clinically inert,
defaulting to safe but potentially inaccurate outputs. To address this gap, our
contributions are mainly two-fold: first, we construct two large-scale,
controlled benchmarks (ED-Triage and Opioid Analgesic Recommendation) from
MIMIC-IV, comprising over 50,000 prompts with twelve race x gender variants and
three context tiers. Second, we propose a multi-metric framework -
Multi-faceted Fairness Assessment based on hARMs ($mFARM$) to audit fairness
for three distinct dimensions of disparity (Allocational, Stability, and
Latent) and aggregate them into an $mFARM$ score. We also present an aggregated
Fairness-Accuracy Balance (FAB) score to benchmark and observe trade-offs
between fairness and prediction accuracy. We empirically evaluate four
open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B, Qwen-2.5-7B, Bio-LLaMA3-8B) and
their finetuned versions under quantization and context variations. Our
findings showcase that the proposed $mFARM$ metrics capture subtle biases more
effectively under various settings. We find that most models maintain robust
performance in terms of $mFARM$ score across varying levels of quantization but
deteriorate significantly when the context is reduced. Our benchmarks and
evaluation code are publicly released to enhance research in aligned AI for
healthcare.

phenomenon of generative AI and formulating requirements for its use in TA, the
following article discusses in detail the structural causes of the problems
associated with it. Although generative AI is constantly being further
developed, the structurally induced risks remain. The article concludes with
proposed solutions and brief notes on their feasibility, as well as some
examples of the use of generative AI in TA work.

Motivation: 当前AI系统虽然功能广泛，但缺乏真正的智能深度，只是表面模拟。作者希望定义真正的智能标准，区分广度与深度的区别。

Method: 提出结构性生成智能本体论框架，包含三个核心条件：生成性（创造新结构）、协调性（将结构组织成理由）、持续性（维持身份认同）。

Result: 建立了真正的智能评估标准，指出当前AI系统因缺乏这三个条件而只是表面智能。如果未来系统满足这些条件，可能成为与人类并存的"第二存在"。

Conclusion: 智能的广度不是根源而是结果，真正的智能源于生成、协调和维持的深度能力。满足这三个条件的系统将超越工具属性，成为新的存在形式。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is often measured by the range of tasks it can
perform. Yet wide ability without depth remains only an imitation. This paper
proposes a Structural-Generative Ontology of Intelligence: true intelligence
exists only when a system can generate new structures, coordinate them into
reasons, and sustain its identity over time. These three conditions --
generativity, coordination, and sustaining -- define the depth that underlies
real intelligence. Current AI systems, however broad in function, remain
surface simulations because they lack this depth. Breadth is not the source of
intelligence but the growth that follows from depth. If future systems were to
meet these conditions, they would no longer be mere tools, but could be seen as
a possible Second Being, standing alongside yet distinct from human existence.

Motivation: 大语言模型在法律领域的应用遇到了可靠性和透明性挑战，而细调途径成本较高。需要找到一种替代方案来提高模型在法律任务中的表现和可解释性。

Method: 采用结构化提示方法：1）将长法律文档分成块并进行增强；2）使用工程化提示将输入传递给QWEN-2模型；3）采用分布基于定位和逆数权重计算两种惩置策略来解决候选答案选择问题。

Result: 方法在CUAD数据集上的信息检索任务中达到了现有最佳性能，性能比之前方法提高了9%。同时也曝露了当前自动评估指标在问答任务中的局限性。

Conclusion: 结构化提示工程是一种有效的工具，可以在不依赖细调的情况下提高AI模型在法律领域的可靠性和负责任性，具有远大的应用潜力。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has had a profoundly transformative
effect on a number of fields and domains. However, their uptake in Law has
proven more challenging due to the important issues of reliability and
transparency. In this study, we present a structured prompting methodology as a
viable alternative to the often expensive fine-tuning, with the capability of
tacking long legal documents from the CUAD dataset on the task of information
retrieval. Each document is first split into chunks via a system of chunking
and augmentation, addressing the long document problem. Then, alongside an
engineered prompt, the input is fed into QWEN-2 to produce a set of answers for
each question. Finally, we tackle the resulting candidate selection problem
with the introduction of the Distribution-based Localisation and Inverse
Cardinality Weighting heuristics. This approach leverages a general purpose
model to promote long term scalability, prompt engineering to increase
reliability and the two heuristic strategies to reduce the impact of the black
box effect. Whilst our model performs up to 9\% better than the previously
presented method, reaching state-of-the-art performance, it also highlights the
limiting factor of current automatic evaluation metrics for question answering,
serving as a call to action for future research. However, the chief aim of this
work is to underscore the potential of structured prompt engineering as a
useful, yet under-explored, tool in ensuring accountability and responsibility
of AI in the legal domain, and beyond.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), together with the
increased availability of social media and news for epidemiological
surveillance, are marking a pivotal moment in epidemiology and public health
research. Leveraging the power of generative AI, we use an ensemble approach
which incorporates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract valuable
actionable epidemiological information from the World Health Organization (WHO)
Disease Outbreak News (DONs). DONs is a collection of regular reports on global
outbreaks curated by the WHO and the adopted decision-making processes to
respond to them. The extracted information is made available in a daily-updated
dataset and a knowledge graph, referred to as eKG, derived to provide a nuanced
representation of the public health domain knowledge. We provide an overview of
this new dataset and describe the structure of eKG, along with the services and
tools used to access and utilize the data that we are building on top. These
innovative data resources open altogether new opportunities for epidemiological
research, and the analysis and surveillance of disease outbreaks.

Conclusion: REx是推进AI驱动科学发现的相关贡献，能够生成基于生物医学知识的深刻且可靠的解释

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for modelling complex,
multi-relational data and supporting hypothesis generation, particularly in
applications like drug repurposing. However, for predictive methods to gain
acceptance as credible scientific tools, they must ensure not only accuracy but
also the capacity to offer meaningful scientific explanations. This paper
presents a novel approach REx, for generating scientific explanations based in
link prediction in knowledge graphs. It employs reward and policy mechanisms
that consider desirable properties of scientific explanation to guide a
reinforcement learning agent in the identification of explanatory paths within
a KG. The approach further enriches explanatory paths with domain-specific
ontologies, ensuring that the explanations are both insightful and grounded in
established biomedical knowledge. We evaluate our approach in drug repurposing
using three popular knowledge graph benchmarks. The results clearly demonstrate
its ability to generate explanations that validate predictive insights against
biomedical knowledge and that outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in
predictive performance, establishing REx as a relevant contribution to advance
AI-driven scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 这篇论文探索了大语言模型在约束三维包装问题中自动设计贫估算法的能力，发现LLM主要集中于优化评分函数，而非完整的算法创新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在复杂贫估设计任务中的创新能力，识别当前LLM在自动化算法设计中的局限性和偏见。

Method: 采用约束脚手架（预写的约束检查代码）和迭代自我纠正（递归精炼修复错误）两种支持方法，让LLM构建完整的3D包装问题求解器。

Result: LLM生成的贫估算法与人工设计的贪心算法相当，当其评分函数集成到人工元贫估中时，性能可与现有求解器相比。但约束越紧，效果越差。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在自动化贫估设计中遇到两大障碍：复杂推理任务的脆弱性需要工程化缓解，以及预训练偏见导致的解空间过早窄缩小。

Abstract: The art of heuristic design has traditionally been a human pursuit. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their
application has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within
human-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open
question. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver
for the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved
fragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint
scaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative
self-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a
viable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy
process, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the
scoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior
work may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of
LLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed
greedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a
human-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers,
though its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened. Our findings highlight
two major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the
engineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks,
and the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search
for novel solutions.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have enabled significant progress in
tasks such as generating and editing images from text, as well as creating
videos from text prompts, and these methods are being applied across various
fields. However, in the financial domain, there may still be a reliance on
time-series data and a continued focus on transformer models, rather than on
diverse applications of generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach that leverages text-to-image model by treating time-series data as a
single image pattern, thereby enabling the prediction of stock price trends.
Unlike prior methods that focus on learning and classifying chart patterns
using architectures such as ResNet or ViT, we experiment with generating the
next chart image from the current chart image and an instruction prompt using
diffusion models. Furthermore, we introduce a simple method for evaluating the
generated chart image against ground truth image. We highlight the potential of
leveraging text-to-image generative models in the financial domain, and our
findings motivate further research to address the current limitations and
expand their applicability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于模型解释性的高光谱图像波段选择方法，通过事后可解释性技术量化各波段对分类决策的贡献度，选择最具影响力的波段子集，在保持分类精度的同时显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像虽然提供丰富的光谱信息，但高维度带来计算负担和冗余，需要进行维度约简。传统方法缺乏对模型决策过程的理解，需要一种能够保持预测性能的原理性波段选择方法。

Method: 使用训练好的分类器，通过事后可解释性方法量化每个波段对决策的贡献；进行删除-插入评估，记录置信度变化；聚合这些信号为影响力分数；选择最高影响力波段形成紧凑子集。

Result: 在两个公开基准数据集（Pavia University和Salinas）上的实验表明，仅使用30个选定波段训练的 classifiers 能够达到或超过全光谱基线性能，同时显著降低计算需求。

Conclusion: 模型对齐、解释引导的波段选择是高光谱图像维度约简的有效原理性途径，所选波段子集与物理上有意义、高度判别性的波长区域一致。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for precise
material classification and analysis; however, its high dimensionality
introduces a computational burden and redundancy, making dimensionality
reduction essential. We present an exploratory study into the application of
post-hoc explainability methods in a model--driven framework for band
selection, which reduces the spectral dimension while preserving predictive
performance. A trained classifier is probed with explanations to quantify each
band's contribution to its decisions. We then perform deletion--insertion
evaluations, recording confidence changes as ranked bands are removed or
reintroduced, and aggregate these signals into influence scores. Selecting the
highest--influence bands yields compact spectral subsets that maintain accuracy
and improve efficiency. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Pavia University
and Salinas) demonstrate that classifiers trained on as few as 30 selected
bands match or exceed full--spectrum baselines while reducing computational
requirements. The resulting subsets align with physically meaningful, highly
discriminative wavelength regions, indicating that model--aligned,
explanation-guided band selection is a principled route to effective
dimensionality reduction for HSI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在复杂软件工程任务中经常出现冗余探索、循环和无法终止等低效行为，现有方法主要在事后诊断失败，需要实时干预机制。

Method: 提出SWE-PRM过程奖励模型，利用常见低效行为的分类学，在执行过程中提供轻量级、可解释的反馈，而不修改底层策略。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified上，闭源PRM将解决率从40.0%提升至50.6%（+10.6个百分点），在中等和困难任务上提升最大，同时减少轨迹长度。

Conclusion: 分类学引导的PRM优于无引导或显式动作规定变体，以仅0.2美元的额外推理成本提供实际可扩展的机制，显著提高SWE代理的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed for complex,
multi-step software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, their trajectories often
contain costly inefficiencies, such as redundant exploration, looping, and
failure to terminate once a solution is reached. Prior work has largely treated
these errors in a post-hoc manner, diagnosing failures only after execution. In
this paper, we introduce SWE-PRM, an inference-time Process Reward Model (PRM)
that intervenes during execution to detect and course-correct trajectory-level
errors. Our PRM design leverages a taxonomy of common inefficiencies and
delivers lightweight, interpretable feedback without modifying the underlying
policy. On SWE-bench Verified, closed-source PRMs improve resolution from 40.0%
to 50.6% (+10.6 p.p.), with the largest gains on medium and hard tasks. Among
feedback strategies, taxonomy-guided PRMs outperform unguided or explicit
action-prescriptive variants, increasing success rate while reducing trajectory
length. These benefits come at an acceptable added inference cost of as low as
$0.2, making PRMs a practical and scalable mechanism for improving SWE agents'
reliability and efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型组织在处理结构化生物医学数据时常常产生流畅但过于自信的输出，需要一种能够感知并控制不确定性的方法来提高可靠性。

Method: 提出了两种互补的不确定性信号：检索不确定性（多次表格选择滚动的熵）和摘要不确定性（结合自我一致性和困惑度）。将摘要不确定性结合到努力学习中，使用组相对策略优化算法，并在推理时使用两种不确定性进行过滤和构建高质量合成数据集。

Result: 在多组学测试集上，该方法显著提高了事实性和校准性，将正确有用的断言数量提高了近三倍（内部数据从3.0到8.4，癌症多组学数据从3.6到9.9），并大幅改善了下游生存预测性能（C指数从0.32提高到0.63）。

Conclusion: 不确定性可以作为一种控制信号，使得组织模型能够退出不确定的任务、沟通信心度，成为处理复杂结构化数据环境的更可靠工具。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in structured
biomedical data environments, yet they often produce fluent but overconfident
outputs when reasoning over complex multi-table data. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware agent for query-conditioned multi-table summarization that
leverages two complementary signals: (i) retrieval uncertainty--entropy over
multiple table-selection rollouts--and (ii) summary uncertainty--combining
self-consistency and perplexity. Summary uncertainty is incorporated into
reinforcement learning (RL) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
while both retrieval and summary uncertainty guide inference-time filtering and
support the construction of higher-quality synthetic datasets.
  On multi-omics benchmarks, our approach improves factuality and calibration,
nearly tripling correct and useful claims per summary (3.0\(\rightarrow\)8.4
internal; 3.6\(\rightarrow\)9.9 cancer multi-omics) and substantially improving
downstream survival prediction (C-index 0.32\(\rightarrow\)0.63). These results
demonstrate that uncertainty can serve as a control signal--enabling agents to
abstain, communicate confidence, and become more reliable tools for complex
structured-data environments.

Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal foundation
models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the
fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that must be
solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1)
generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy,
specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3)
long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency,
specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We
present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device
assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack,
closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this
position through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection,
training, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile
application development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal
foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and
control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task
planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution
layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice
interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and
comprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates
profiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across
heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant
improvements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization,
higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion,
and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in
native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,
action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data
scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of
GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we
present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these
challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for
scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI
environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox
platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.
On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on
WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines
such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean
normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level
performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,
OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to
long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,
highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of
training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and
efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's
potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization
to real-world interactive scenarios.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm
shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models
(LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous,
decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey
formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended,
partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL.
Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one
organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use,
memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their
applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that
reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these
capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic
behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the
landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a
practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this
survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the
opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable,
general-purpose AI agents.

Conclusion: IOG框架能够实现早期火灾风险检测，并根据风险演变提供可解释的应急响应，为任务模块和机器人组件配置提供支持

Abstract: Fire is a highly destructive disaster, but effective prevention can
significantly reduce its likelihood of occurrence. When it happens, deploying
emergency robots in fire-risk scenarios can help minimize the danger to human
responders. However, current research on pre-disaster warnings and
disaster-time rescue still faces significant challenges due to incomplete
perception, inadequate fire situational awareness, and delayed response. To
enhance intelligent perception and response planning for robots in fire
scenarios, we first construct a knowledge graph (KG) by leveraging large
language models (LLMs) to integrate fire domain knowledge derived from fire
prevention guidelines and fire rescue task information from robotic emergency
response documents. We then propose a new framework called Insights-on-Graph
(IOG), which integrates the structured fire information of KG and Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs). The framework generates perception-driven risk graphs
from real-time scene imagery to enable early fire risk detection and provide
interpretable emergency responses for task module and robot component
configuration based on the evolving risk situation. Extensive simulations and
real-world experiments show that IOG has good applicability and practical
application value in fire risk detection and rescue decision-making.

Abstract: Swarm UAV autonomous flight for Long-Horizon (LH) tasks is crucial for
advancing the low-altitude economy. However, existing methods focus only on
specific basic tasks due to dataset limitations, failing in real-world
deployment for LH tasks. LH tasks are not mere concatenations of basic tasks,
requiring handling long-term dependencies, maintaining persistent states, and
adapting to dynamic goal shifts. This paper presents U2UData-2, the first
large-scale swarm UAV autonomous flight dataset for LH tasks and the first
scalable swarm UAV data online collection and algorithm closed-loop
verification platform. The dataset is captured by 15 UAVs in autonomous
collaborative flights for LH tasks, comprising 12 scenes, 720 traces, 120
hours, 600 seconds per trajectory, 4.32M LiDAR frames, and 12.96M RGB frames.
This dataset also includes brightness, temperature, humidity, smoke, and
airflow values covering all flight routes. The platform supports the
customization of simulators, UAVs, sensors, flight algorithms, formation modes,
and LH tasks. Through a visual control window, this platform allows users to
collect customized datasets through one-click deployment online and to verify
algorithms by closed-loop simulation. U2UData-2 also introduces an LH task for
wildlife conservation and provides comprehensive benchmarks with 9 SOTA models.

Abstract: This paper presents a correspondence-free, function-based sim-to-real
learning method for controlling deformable freeform surfaces. Unlike
traditional sim-to-real transfer methods that strongly rely on marker points
with full correspondences, our approach simultaneously learns a deformation
function space and a confidence map -- both parameterized by a neural network
-- to map simulated shapes to their real-world counterparts. As a result, the
sim-to-real learning can be conducted by input from either a 3D scanner as
point clouds (without correspondences) or a motion capture system as marker
points (tolerating missed markers). The resultant sim-to-real transfer can be
seamlessly integrated into a neural network-based computational pipeline for
inverse kinematics and shape control. We demonstrate the versatility and
adaptability of our method on both vision devices and across four pneumatically
actuated soft robots: a deformable membrane, a robotic mannequin, and two soft
manipulators.

Abstract: Rebar tying is a repetitive but critical task in reinforced concrete
construction, typically performed manually at considerable ergonomic risk.
Recent advances in robotic manipulation hold the potential to automate the
tying process, yet face challenges in accurately estimating tying poses in
congested rebar nodes. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid perception and
motion planning approach that integrates geometry-based perception with
Equivariant Denoising Diffusion on SE(3) (Diffusion-EDFs) to enable robust
multi-node rebar tying with minimal training data. Our perception module
utilizes density-based clustering (DBSCAN), geometry-based node feature
extraction, and principal component analysis (PCA) to segment rebar bars,
identify rebar nodes, and estimate orientation vectors for sequential ranking,
even in complex, unstructured environments. The motion planner, based on
Diffusion-EDFs, is trained on as few as 5-10 demonstrations to generate
sequential end-effector poses that optimize collision avoidance and tying
efficiency. The proposed system is validated on various rebar meshes, including
single-layer, multi-layer, and cluttered configurations, demonstrating high
success rates in node detection and accurate sequential tying. Compared with
conventional approaches that rely on large datasets or extensive manual
parameter tuning, our method achieves robust, efficient, and adaptable
multi-node tying while significantly reducing data requirements. This result
underscores the potential of hybrid perception and diffusion-driven planning to
enhance automation in on-site construction tasks, improving both safety and
labor efficiency.

Method: 使用得克萨斯州高分辨率AVL数据，评估13种轨迹重建方法，分析速度、位置、平滑和数据密度四个关键因素的影响。

Result: 速度相关方法永远超过仅依靠位置的方法。平滑方法在复杂城市环境中可能降低性能。VCHIP-ME方法表现最优，在准确性和计算效率之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 研究给出了轨迹重建系统的实践指南，并强调投资高频率AVL数据采集的重要性。VCHIP-ME方法适用于各种应用场景，特别是与密集数据结合时具有显著预测能力。

Abstract: Automatic vehicle location (AVL) data offers insights into transit dynamics,
but its effectiveness is often hampered by inconsistent update frequencies,
necessitating trajectory reconstruction. This research evaluates 13 trajectory
reconstruction methods, including several novel approaches, using
high-resolution AVL data from Austin, Texas. We examine the interplay of four
critical factors -- velocity, position, smoothing, and data density -- on
reconstruction performance. A key contribution of this study is evaluation of
these methods across sparse and dense datasets, providing insights into the
trade-off between accuracy and resource allocation. Our evaluation framework
combines traditional mathematical error metrics for positional and velocity
with practical considerations, such as physical realism (e.g., aligning
velocity and acceleration with stopped states, deceleration rates, and speed
variability). In addition, we provide insight into the relative value of each
method in calculating realistic metrics for infrastructure evaluations. Our
findings indicate that velocity-aware methods consistently outperform
position-only approaches. Interestingly, we discovered that smoothing-based
methods can degrade overall performance in complex, congested urban
environments, although enforcing monotonicity remains critical. The velocity
constrained Hermite interpolation with monotonicity enforcement (VCHIP-ME)
yields optimal results, offering a balance between high accuracy and
computational efficiency. Its minimal overhead makes it suitable for both
historical analysis and real-time applications, providing significant
predictive power when combined with dense datasets. These findings offer
practical guidance for researchers and practitioners implementing trajectory
reconstruction systems and emphasize the importance of investing in
higher-frequency AVL data collection for improved analysis.

Motivation: 在动态机器人任务中，机器人需要识别物体的相关物理属性才能成功执行任务，但由于无法从失败中恢复或重试，因此需要高效的探索方法。

Method: 基于强化学习的任务驱动探索方法，使用特权任务策略对属性估计误差的敏感性自动生成奖励来训练探索策略，并引入不确定性机制决定探索到任务执行的转换时机。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效地识别物体物理属性，通过任务驱动的奖励机制捕获物理属性的相对重要性，并在真实物理系统中验证了有效性。

Abstract: In many dynamic robotic tasks, such as striking pucks into a goal outside the
reachable workspace, the robot must first identify the relevant physical
properties of the object for successful task execution, as it is unable to
recover from failure or retry without human intervention. To address this
challenge, we propose a task-informed exploration approach, based on
reinforcement learning, that trains an exploration policy using rewards
automatically generated from the sensitivity of a privileged task policy to
errors in estimated properties. We also introduce an uncertainty-based
mechanism to determine when to transition from exploration to task execution,
ensuring sufficient property estimation accuracy with minimal exploration time.
Our method achieves a 90% success rate on the striking task with an average
exploration time under 1.2 seconds, significantly outperforming baselines that
achieve at most 40% success or require inefficient querying and retraining in a
simulator at test time. Additionally, we demonstrate that our task-informed
rewards capture the relative importance of physical properties in both the
striking task and the classical CartPole example. Finally, we validate our
approach by demonstrating its ability to identify object properties and adjust
task execution in a physical setup using the KUKA iiwa robot arm.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合强化学习方法，通过模拟器生成轨迹，同时使用学习的可微分模型计算梯度，实现了高效的一阶策略优化，即使在模拟器梯度不可用的情况下也能保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于梯度的强化学习方法需要访问模拟器梯度，但实际中往往难以实现。基于模型的RL方法虽然可以近似梯度，但存在预测误差累积和策略性能下降的问题。

Method: 将轨迹生成与梯度计算解耦：使用模拟器展开轨迹，同时通过学习的可微分模拟器模型进行反向传播计算梯度。这种混合设计支持高效的一阶策略优化。

Result: 在基准控制任务上验证了算法的有效性，并在真实的Go2四足机器人上成功实现了四足和双足运动任务，达到了与SHAC等专用优化器相当的样本效率和速度。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了专用优化器的效率优势和标准方法的通用性，避免了其他一阶MBRL方法的不良行为，为模拟器梯度不可用情况下的强化学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: There is growing interest in reinforcement learning (RL) methods that
leverage the simulator's derivatives to improve learning efficiency. While
early gradient-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared
to derivative-free methods, accessing simulator gradients is often impractical
due to their implementation cost or unavailability. Model-based RL (MBRL) can
approximate these gradients via learned dynamics models, but the solver
efficiency suffers from compounding prediction errors during training rollouts,
which can degrade policy performance. We propose an approach that decouples
trajectory generation from gradient computation: trajectories are unrolled
using a simulator, while gradients are computed via backpropagation through a
learned differentiable model of the simulator. This hybrid design enables
efficient and consistent first-order policy optimization, even when simulator
gradients are unavailable, as well as learning a critic from simulation
rollouts, which is more accurate. Our method achieves the sample efficiency and
speed of specialized optimizers such as SHAC, while maintaining the generality
of standard approaches like PPO and avoiding ill behaviors observed in other
first-order MBRL methods. We empirically validate our algorithm on benchmark
control tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real Go2 quadruped robot,
across both quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion tasks.

TL;DR: 通过分离动作生成与验证，使用无条件涵渗生成器提出多个候选动作，然后利用历史感知验证器根据过往交互选择最优动作


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人遇到视觉模糊的对象时，传统生成模型在模糊情况下表现次优，需要更有效的方法来处理不确定性

Method: 提出HAVE方法：使用无条件涵渗生成器产生多个候选动作，然后通过历史感知验证器根据过往交互记录选择最优动作

Result: 理论分析证明使用验证器显著提高了预期动作质量。多个模拟和实际环境的实验证明方法在关节对象、多模态门和不均匀物体拐取任务中都有效

Conclusion: HAVE方法通过明确分离动作生成与验证过程，利用历史信息有效地处理视觉模糊情况，显著提升了机器人在不确定场景中的性能

Abstract: We introduce a novel History-Aware VErifier (HAVE) to disambiguate uncertain
scenarios online by leveraging past interactions. Robots frequently encounter
visually ambiguous objects whose manipulation outcomes remain uncertain until
physically interacted with. While generative models alone could theoretically
adapt to such ambiguity, in practice they obtain suboptimal performance in
ambiguous cases, even when conditioned on action history. To address this, we
propose explicitly decoupling action generation from verification: we use an
unconditional diffusion-based generator to propose multiple candidate actions
and employ our history-aware verifier to select the most promising action by
reasoning about past interactions. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate
that employing a verifier significantly improves expected action quality.
Empirical evaluations and analysis across multiple simulated and real-world
environments including articulated objects, multi-modal doors, and uneven
object pick-up confirm the effectiveness of our method and improvements over
baselines. Our project website is available at:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TReF-6是一种从单次演示中推断6自由度任务相关框架的方法，通过轨迹几何识别影响点来定义局部坐标系，结合视觉语言模型实现语义理解和跨场景技能泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人通常难以从单次演示中泛化，因为缺乏可迁移和可解释的空间表示。现有方法在超越起点-终点模仿方面存在局限。

Method: 从轨迹几何中识别影响点来定义局部坐标系的原点，作为动态运动基元(DMP)的参数化参考。通过视觉语言模型进行语义接地，使用Grounded-SAM在新场景中定位框架。

Result: 在仿真中验证了TReF-6的有效性，展示了其对轨迹噪声的鲁棒性。在真实世界操作任务中实现了端到端管道，支持一次性模仿学习并在不同物体配置中保持任务意图。

Conclusion: TReF-6提供了一种可解释的空间表示方法，能够从单次演示中实现功能一致的技能泛化，为机器人模仿学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Robots often struggle to generalize from a single demonstration due to the
lack of a transferable and interpretable spatial representation. In this work,
we introduce TReF-6, a method that infers a simplified, abstracted 6DoF
Task-Relevant Frame from a single trajectory. Our approach identifies an
influence point purely from the trajectory geometry to define the origin for a
local frame, which serves as a reference for parameterizing a Dynamic Movement
Primitive (DMP). This influence point captures the task's spatial structure,
extending the standard DMP formulation beyond start-goal imitation. The
inferred frame is semantically grounded via a vision-language model and
localized in novel scenes by Grounded-SAM, enabling functionally consistent
skill generalization. We validate TReF-6 in simulation and demonstrate
robustness to trajectory noise. We further deploy an end-to-end pipeline on
real-world manipulation tasks, showing that TReF-6 supports one-shot imitation
learning that preserves task intent across diverse object configurations.

Motivation: 空间环境中的机器人自主性面临高感知和运动不确定性、严格运动学约束以及有限人工干预机会等独特挑战，需要能够整合离散动作序列和连续运动可行性评估的任务与运动规划方法。

Method: TMP-EAOG框架在AND/OR图中编码任务级抽象，随着计划执行迭代扩展图结构，并在循环中进行运动规划评估以确定可行性。该方法能够适应不可预测的环境信息。

Result: 在模拟移动机械臂上的评估表明，TMP-EAOG能够处理基准测试中的各种挑战，展现出良好的适应性。

Conclusion: TMP-EAOG框架为空间自主机器人提供了具有鲁棒性、可控自主性和有限灵活性的任务与运动规划解决方案，适用于自主服务、表面操作和轨道任务等多种空间应用场景。

Abstract: Robot autonomy in space environments presents unique challenges, including
high perception and motion uncertainty, strict kinematic constraints, and
limited opportunities for human intervention. Therefore, Task and Motion
Planning (TMP) may be critical for autonomous servicing, surface operations, or
even in-orbit missions, just to name a few, as it models tasks as discrete
action sequencing integrated with continuous motion feasibility assessments. In
this paper, we introduce a TMP framework based on expanding AND/OR graphs,
referred to as TMP-EAOG, and demonstrate its adaptability to different
scenarios. TMP-EAOG encodes task-level abstractions within an AND/OR graph,
which expands iteratively as the plan is executed, and performs in-the-loop
motion planning assessments to ascertain their feasibility. As a consequence,
TMP-EAOG is characterised by the desirable properties of (i) robustness to a
certain degree of uncertainty, because AND/OR graph expansion can accommodate
for unpredictable information about the robot environment, (ii) controlled
autonomy, since an AND/OR graph can be validated by human experts, and (iii)
bounded flexibility, in that unexpected events, including the assessment of
unfeasible motions, can lead to different courses of action as alternative
paths in the AND/OR graph. We evaluate TMP-EAOG on two benchmark domains. We
use a simulated mobile manipulator as a proxy for space-grade autonomous
robots. Our evaluation shows that TMP-EAOG can deal with a wide range of
challenges in the benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态胃环境中导航柔性内窥镜具有挑战性，需要学习利用与可变形胃壁的接触来达到目标位置

Method: 使用基于物理的有限元方法模拟可变形胃环境，采用近端策略优化算法训练接触辅助导航策略

Result: 在静态和动态胃环境中达到100%成功率（平均误差1.6mm），在未见挑战场景中保持85%成功率

Conclusion: 基于深度强化学习的接触辅助导航策略显著提升了柔性内窥镜的导航性能

Abstract: Navigating a flexible robotic endoscope (FRE) through the gastrointestinal
tract is critical for surgical diagnosis and treatment. However, navigation in
the dynamic stomach is particularly challenging because the FRE must learn to
effectively use contact with the deformable stomach walls to reach target
locations. To address this, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
based Contact-Aided Navigation (CAN) strategy for FREs, leveraging contact
force feedback to enhance motion stability and navigation precision. The
training environment is established using a physics-based finite element method
(FEM) simulation of a deformable stomach. Trained with the Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) algorithm, our approach achieves high navigation success
rates (within 3 mm error between the FRE's end-effector and target) and
significantly outperforms baseline policies. In both static and dynamic stomach
environments, the CAN agent achieved a 100% success rate with 1.6 mm average
error, and it maintained an 85% success rate in challenging unseen scenarios
with stronger external disturbances. These results validate that the DRL-based
CAN strategy substantially enhances FRE navigation performance over prior
methods.

Conclusion: 证明了体现VLA模型的可解释组件可以系统性地用于控制，为机器人领域的透明可控基础模型建立了新范式

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are a promising path to realizing
generalist embodied agents that can quickly adapt to new tasks, modalities, and
environments. However, methods for interpreting and steering VLAs fall far
short of classical robotics pipelines, which are grounded in explicit models of
kinematics, dynamics, and control. This lack of mechanistic insight is a
central challenge for deploying learned policies in real-world robotics, where
robustness and explainability are critical. Motivated by advances in
mechanistic interpretability for large language models, we introduce the first
framework for interpreting and steering VLAs via their internal
representations, enabling direct intervention in model behavior at inference
time. We project feedforward activations within transformer layers onto the
token embedding basis, identifying sparse semantic directions - such as speed
and direction - that are causally linked to action selection. Leveraging these
findings, we introduce a general-purpose activation steering method that
modulates behavior in real time, without fine-tuning, reward signals, or
environment interaction. We evaluate this method on two recent open-source
VLAs, Pi0 and OpenVLA, and demonstrate zero-shot behavioral control in
simulation (LIBERO) and on a physical robot (UR5). This work demonstrates that
interpretable components of embodied VLAs can be systematically harnessed for
control - establishing a new paradigm for transparent and steerable foundation
models in robotics.

Motivation: 可变形连续体机器人由于非线性变形力学和部分状态可观测性，违反了传统强化学习的马尔可夫假设，而基于雅可比的方法在时变运动学和欠驱动变形动力学方面存在局限

Method: JEDP-RL框架将规划分解为分阶段的雅可比估计和策略执行：首先执行小规模局部探索动作估计变形雅可比矩阵，然后用雅可比特征增强状态表示以恢复近似马尔可夫性

Result: 在SOFA手术动态仿真中，相比PPO基线：收敛速度快3.2倍，导航效率提升25%（更少步骤到达目标），泛化能力在材料属性变化下达到92%成功率，在未见组织环境中达到83%成功率（比PPO高33%）

Conclusion: JEDP-RL框架通过雅可比探索和状态增强有效解决了可变形连续体机器人的规划挑战，在多个性能指标上显著优于传统强化学习方法

Abstract: Deformable continuum robots (DCRs) present unique planning challenges due to
nonlinear deformation mechanics and partial state observability, violating the
Markov assumptions of conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. While
Jacobian-based approaches offer theoretical foundations for rigid manipulators,
their direct application to DCRs remains limited by time-varying kinematics and
underactuated deformation dynamics. This paper proposes Jacobian Exploratory
Dual-Phase RL (JEDP-RL), a framework that decomposes planning into phased
Jacobian estimation and policy execution. During each training step, we first
perform small-scale local exploratory actions to estimate the deformation
Jacobian matrix, then augment the state representation with Jacobian features
to restore approximate Markovianity. Extensive SOFA surgical dynamic
simulations demonstrate JEDP-RL's three key advantages over proximal policy
optimization (PPO) baselines: 1) Convergence speed: 3.2x faster policy
convergence, 2) Navigation efficiency: requires 25% fewer steps to reach the
target, and 3) Generalization ability: achieve 92% success rate under material
property variations and achieve 83% (33% higher than PPO) success rate in the
unseen tissue environment.

Abstract: Traditional aggregate sorting methods, whether manual or mechanical, often
suffer from low precision, limited flexibility, and poor adaptability to
diverse material properties such as size, shape, and lithology. To address
these limitations, this study presents a computer vision-aided robotic arm
system designed for autonomous aggregate sorting in construction and mining
applications. The system integrates a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, a
binocular stereo camera for 3D perception, and a ROS-based control framework.
Core techniques include an attention-augmented YOLOv8 model for aggregate
detection, stereo matching for 3D localization, Denavit-Hartenberg kinematic
modeling for arm motion control, minimum enclosing rectangle analysis for size
estimation, and hand-eye calibration for precise coordinate alignment.
Experimental validation with four aggregate types achieved an average grasping
and sorting success rate of 97.5%, with comparable classification accuracy.
Remaining challenges include the reliable handling of small aggregates and
texture-based misclassification. Overall, the proposed system demonstrates
significant potential to enhance productivity, reduce operational costs, and
improve safety in aggregate handling, while providing a scalable framework for
advancing smart automation in construction, mining, and recycling industries.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires systems that can
generalize across diverse tasks while maintaining robust and reliable
performance. We introduce {GVF-TAPE}, a closed-loop framework that combines
generative visual foresight with task-agnostic pose estimation to enable
scalable robotic manipulation. GVF-TAPE employs a generative video model to
predict future RGB-D frames from a single side-view RGB image and a task
description, offering visual plans that guide robot actions. A decoupled pose
estimation model then extracts end-effector poses from the predicted frames,
translating them into executable commands via low-level controllers. By
iteratively integrating video foresight and pose estimation in a closed loop,
GVF-TAPE achieves real-time, adaptive manipulation across a broad range of
tasks. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings
demonstrate that our approach reduces reliance on task-specific action data and
generalizes effectively, providing a practical and scalable solution for
intelligent robotic systems.

long-horizon decision-making. This work lays a foundation for robots that can
robustly perceive their surroundings and intelligently act upon complex,

Abstract: This paper presents two types of extended diffeomorphism designs to
compensate for spatial placement differences between robot workspaces.
Teleoperation of multiple robots is attracting attention to expand the
utilization of the robot embodiment. Real-time reproduction of robot motion
would facilitate the efficient execution of similar tasks by multiple robots. A
challenge in the motion reproduction is compensating for the spatial
arrangement errors of target keypoints in robot workspaces. This paper proposes
a methodology for smooth mappings that transform primary robot poses into
follower robot poses based on the predefined key points in each workspace.
Through a picking task experiment using a dual-arm UR5 robot, this study
demonstrates that the proposed mapping generation method can balance lower
mapping errors for precise operation and lower mapping gradients for smooth
replicated movement.

Abstract: The trajectory data of traffic participants (TPs) is a fundamental resource

per minute, involving roughly 25% of all motor vehicles. FLUID provides
comprehensive data, including trajectories, traffic signals, maps, and raw
videos. Comparison with the DataFromSky platform and ground-truth measurements
validates its high spatio-temporal accuracy. Through a detailed classification
of motor vehicle conflicts and violations, FLUID reveals a diversity of
interactive behaviors, demonstrating its value for human preference mining,

Abstract: Robot manipulation in unstructured environments requires efficient and

Traditional discrete methods potentially miss collisions between these points,

Abstract: ConceptBot is a modular robotic planning framework that combines Large
Language Models and Knowledge Graphs to generate feasible and risk-aware plans
despite ambiguities in natural language instructions and correctly analyzing
the objects present in the environment - challenges that typically arise from a
lack of commonsense reasoning. To do that, ConceptBot integrates (i) an Object
Property Extraction (OPE) module that enriches scene understanding with
semantic concepts from ConceptNet, (ii) a User Request Processing (URP) module
that disambiguates and structures instructions, and (iii) a Planner that
generates context-aware, feasible pick-and-place policies. In comparative
evaluations against Google SayCan, ConceptBot achieved 100% success on explicit
tasks, maintained 87% accuracy on implicit tasks (versus 31% for SayCan),
reached 76% on risk-aware tasks (versus 15%), and outperformed SayCan in
application-specific scenarios, including material classification (70% vs. 20%)
and toxicity detection (86% vs. 36%). On SafeAgentBench, ConceptBot achieved an
overall score of 80% (versus 46% for the next-best baseline). These results,
validated in both simulation and laboratory experiments, demonstrate
ConceptBot's ability to generalize without domain-specific training and to

Motivation: 计算力矩方法(CTM)受限于系统参数不准确，而深度强化学习(DRL)存在样本效率低和稳定性保证弱的问题，需要结合两者优势

Method: 使用TD3算法，用灰盒计算力矩控制器替代DRL的黑盒策略网络，约束控制器参数在物理合理范围内，并强制临界阻尼闭环时间响应

Result: 在MuJoCo物理引擎中模拟差速驱动机器人，与原始CTC和传统运动学控制器相比表现出优越性能

Conclusion: 该方法能够仅用少量学习回合就找到任意奖励函数的最优控制器参数集，同时确保物理合理性和稳定性

Abstract: This study presents a learning-based nonlinear algorithm for tracking control
of differential-drive mobile robots. The Computed Torque Method (CTM) suffers
from inaccurate knowledge of system parameters, while Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) algorithms are known for sample inefficiency and weak stability
guarantees. The proposed method replaces the black-box policy network of a DRL
agent with a gray-box Computed Torque Controller (CTC) to improve sample
efficiency and ensure closed-loop stability. This approach enables finding an
optimal set of controller parameters for an arbitrary reward function using
only a few short learning episodes. The Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (TD3) algorithm is used for this purpose. Additionally, some
controller parameters are constrained to lie within known value ranges,
ensuring the RL agent learns physically plausible values. A technique is also
applied to enforce a critically damped closed-loop time response. The
controller's performance is evaluated on a differential-drive mobile robot
simulated in the MuJoCo physics engine and compared against the raw CTC and a
conventional kinematic controller.

Conclusion: LfD为电影领域提供了无需奖励函数的鲁棒替代方案，能够以最小技术努力实现实时部署，使创意专业人士能够获得直观、风格化的相机控制

Abstract: Cinematic camera control demands a balance of precision and artistry -
qualities that are difficult to encode through handcrafted reward functions.
While reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to robotic filmmaking, its
reliance on bespoke rewards and extensive tuning limits creative usability. We
propose a Learning from Demonstration (LfD) approach using Generative
Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) to automate dolly-in shots with a
free-roaming, ground-based filming robot. Expert trajectories are collected via
joystick teleoperation in simulation, capturing smooth, expressive motion
without explicit objective design.
  Trained exclusively on these demonstrations, our GAIL policy outperforms a
PPO baseline in simulation, achieving higher rewards, faster convergence, and
lower variance. Crucially, it transfers directly to a real-world robot without
fine-tuning, achieving more consistent framing and subject alignment than a
prior TD3-based method. These results show that LfD offers a robust,
reward-free alternative to RL in cinematic domains, enabling real-time
deployment with minimal technical effort. Our pipeline brings intuitive,
stylized camera control within reach of creative professionals, bridging the
gap between artistic intent and robotic autonomy.

All demonstrations are gathered using a consistent robotic embodiment, paired
with precise subtask-level language annotations to facilitate both training and

that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multimodal planning with a
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for fine-grained execution. G0 is trained
using a three-stage curriculum: cross-embodiment pre-training,
single-embodiment pre-training, and task-specific post-training. A

together with the Galaxea Open-World Dataset, plays a critical role in
achieving strong performance.

Abstract: Autonomous driving technology has made significant advancements in recent
years, yet challenges remain in ensuring safe and comfortable interactions with
human-driven vehicles (HDVs), particularly during lane-changing maneuvers. This
paper proposes an improved double quintic polynomial approach for safe and
efficient lane-changing in mixed traffic environments. The proposed method
integrates a time-to-collision (TTC) based evaluation mechanism directly into
the trajectory optimization process, ensuring that the ego vehicle proactively
maintains a safe gap from surrounding HDVs throughout the maneuver. The
framework comprises state estimation for both the autonomous vehicle (AV) and
HDVs, trajectory generation using double quintic polynomials, real-time TTC
computation, and adaptive trajectory evaluation. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work to embed an analytic TTC penalty directly into the
closed-form double-quintic polynomial solver, enabling real-time safety-aware
trajectory generation without post-hoc validation. Extensive simulations
conducted under diverse traffic scenarios demonstrate the safety, efficiency,
and comfort of the proposed approach compared to conventional methods such as
quintic polynomials, Bezier curves, and B-splines. The results highlight that
the improved method not only avoids collisions but also ensures smooth
transitions and adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments. This work
bridges the gap between model-based and adaptive trajectory planning
approaches, offering a stable solution for real-world autonomous driving
applications.

Abstract: Extensive research has already been conducted in the autonomous driving field
to help vehicles navigate safely and efficiently. At the same time, plenty of
current research on vulnerable road user (VRU) safety is performed which
largely concentrates on perception, localization, or trajectory prediction of
VRUs. However, existing research still exhibits several gaps, including the
lack of a unified planning and collision avoidance system for autonomous
vehicles, limited investigation into delay tolerant control strategies, and the
absence of an efficient and standardized testing methodology. Ensuring VRU
safety remains one of the most pressing challenges in autonomous driving,
particularly in dynamic and unpredictable environments. In this two year

Abstract: Trajectory planning is a critical component in ensuring the safety,
stability, and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. While existing trajectory
planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high
computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited
validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose
an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i)
a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly
balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this
cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of
desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed
framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a
dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is
based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and
sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The
sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the
proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives,
providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization
methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of
scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.

Abstract: We propose an effective method for solving the inverse kinematic problem of a
specific model of 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator using computer
algebra. It is known that when the rotation axes of three consecutive
rotational joints of a manipulator intersect at a single point, the inverse
kinematics problem can be divided into determining position and orientation. We
extend this method to more general manipulators in which the rotational axes of
two consecutive joints intersect. This extension broadens the class of 6-DOF
manipulators for which the inverse kinematics problem can be solved, and is
expected to enable more efficient solutions. The inverse kinematic problem is
solved using the Comprehensive Gr\"obner System (CGS) with joint parameters of
the robot appearing as parameters in the coefficients to prevent repetitive
calculations of the Gr\"obner bases. The effectiveness of the proposed method
is shown by experiments.

Abstract: An effective method for optimizing path planning for a specific model of a

are given a path in the form of a set of line segments that the end-effector

kinematic problem of the manipulator at each via-point of the trajectory. The
proposed method consists of three steps. First, we calculate the feasible
region of the manipulator under a specific configuration of the end-effector.
Next, we aim to find a trajectory on the line segments and a sequence of joint
configurations the manipulator should follow to move the end-effector along the
specified trajectory. Finally, we find the optimal combination of solutions to
the inverse kinematic problem at each via-point along the trajectory by
reducing the problem to a shortest-path problem of the graph and applying
Dijkstra's algorithm. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by

Conclusion: CDF-MPPI框架在保持碰撞避免能力的同时大幅提升计算效率，适用于高维运动规划问题

Abstract: Motion planning for robotic manipulators is a fundamental problem in
robotics. Classical optimization-based methods typically rely on the gradients
of signed distance fields (SDFs) to impose collision-avoidance constraints.
However, these methods are susceptible to local minima and may fail when the
SDF gradients vanish. Recently, Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDFs) have
been introduced, which directly model distances in the robot's configuration
space. Unlike workspace SDFs, CDFs are differentiable almost everywhere and
thus provide reliable gradient information. On the other hand, gradient-free
approaches such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control leverage
long-horizon rollouts to achieve collision avoidance. While effective, these
methods are computationally expensive due to the large number of trajectory
samples, repeated collision checks, and the difficulty of designing cost
functions with heterogeneous physical units. In this paper, we propose a
framework that integrates CDFs with MPPI to enable direct navigation in the
robot's configuration space. Leveraging CDF gradients, we unify the MPPI cost
in joint-space and reduce the horizon to one step, substantially cutting
computation while preserving collision avoidance in practice. We demonstrate
that our approach achieves nearly 100% success rates in 2D environments and
consistently high success rates in challenging 7-DOF Franka manipulator
simulations with complex obstacles. Furthermore, our method attains control
frequencies exceeding 750 Hz, substantially outperforming both
optimization-based and standard MPPI baselines. These results highlight the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed CDF-MPPI framework for
high-dimensional motion planning.

Abstract: This paper presents an MFG-based decision-making framework for autonomous

to parameters such as speed, safety factors, and reaction time. These
parameters are embedded into the MFG through a spatial influence field model.
To ensure safe operation in dense traffic, we introduce a safety-critical
lane-changing algorithm that leverages dynamic safety margins,
time-to-collision analysis, and multi-layered constraints. Real-world NGSIM
data is employed for style calibration and empirical validation. Experimental
results demonstrate zero collisions across six style combinations, two

conventional game-theoretic baselines. Overall, our approach provides a
scalable, interpretable, and behavior-aware planning framework for real-world

Abstract: This paper presents a robust numerical method for solving systems of
trigonometric equations commonly encountered in robotic kinematics. Our
approach employs polynomial substitution techniques combined with eigenvalue
decomposition to handle singular matrices and edge cases effectively. The
method demonstrates superior numerical stability compared to traditional
approaches and has been implemented as an open-source Python package. For
non-singular matrices, we employ Weierstrass substitution to transform the
system into a quartic polynomial, ensuring all analytical solutions are found.
For singular matrices, we develop specialized geometric constraint methods
using SVD analysis. The solver demonstrates machine precision accuracy ($<
10^{-15}$ error) with 100\% success rate on extensive test cases, making it
particularly valuable for robotics applications such as inverse kinematics

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高自由度系统的全局运动规划面临状态维数和规划轨迹增长导致的组合爆烈问题，使得实时规划变得不可行

Method: 在低维任务空间（如指尖位置）进行全局规划，在完整关节空间进行局部跟踪，通过多任务空间坐标的速度场构建和加权关节空间QP求解来计算关节速度

Result: 通过模拟实验和实际测试（使用FoundationPose算法）验证方法能够让高自由度手臂系统在动态环境中执行实时无碰撞到达运动

Conclusion: 该层次框架有效解决了高自由度系统的实时反应急捉挑战，能够适应动态环境和外部干扰

Abstract: We present a fast and reactive grasping framework for multi-DoF grippers that
combines task-space velocity fields with a joint-space Quadratic Program (QP)
in a hierarchical structure. Reactive, collision-free global motion planning is
particularly challenging for high-DoF systems, since simultaneous increases in
state dimensionality and planning horizon trigger a combinatorial explosion of
the search space, making real-time planning intractable. To address this, we
plan globally in a lower-dimensional task space, such as fingertip positions,
and track locally in the full joint space while enforcing all constraints. This
approach is realized by constructing velocity fields in multiple task-space
coordinates (or in some cases a subset of joint coordinates) and solving a
weighted joint-space QP to compute joint velocities that track these fields
with appropriately assigned priorities. Through simulation experiments with
privileged knowledge and real-world tests using the recent pose-tracking
algorithm FoundationPose, we verify that our method enables high-DoF arm-hand
systems to perform real-time, collision-free reaching motions while adapting to
dynamic environments and external disturbances.

Motivation: 软体机器人的柔韧性虽然带来适应性和安全性优势，但也引入了高度不确定和非线性运动问题，传统开环控制和确定性模型难以有效处理这些不确定性

Method: 使用Fokker-Planck方程(FPE)作为随机过程的主方程，控制软体机器人的概率分布而非状态本身，开发了FPE-MPC控制策略并在软体机器人手指上实现

Result: 通过两个数值仿真案例研究验证了该控制方法的性能和特性，证明其能有效管理软体机器人系统中的不确定性

Conclusion: FPE-MPC方法为软体机器人的不确定性控制提供了有效解决方案，基于概率分布的控制策略在处理软体机器人非线性运动方面表现出良好效果

Abstract: The inherent flexibility of soft robots offers numerous advantages, such as
enhanced adaptability and improved safety. However, this flexibility can also
introduce challenges regarding highly uncertain and nonlinear motion. These
challenges become particularly problematic when using open-loop control
methods, which lack a feedback mechanism and are commonly employed in soft
robot control. Though one potential solution is model-based control, typical
deterministic models struggle with uncertainty as mentioned above. The idea is
to use the Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE), a master equation of a stochastic
process, to control not the state of soft robots but the probabilistic
distribution. In this study, we propose and implement a stochastic-based
control strategy, termed FPE-based Model Predictive Control (FPE-MPC), for a
soft robotic finger. Two numerical simulation case studies examine the
performance and characteristics of this control method, revealing its efficacy
in managing the uncertainty inherent in soft robotic systems.

Conclusion: SRR-SLAM通过环境感知的场景可靠性评估显著提升了自主机器人传感系统的测量精度和可靠性，为动态环境下的视觉SLAM提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) plays a critical role in
autonomous robotic systems, especially where accurate and reliable measurements
are essential for navigation and sensing. In feature-based SLAM, the
quantityand quality of extracted features significantly influence system
performance. Due to the variations in feature quantity and quality across
diverse environments, current approaches face two major challenges: (1) limited
adaptability in dynamic feature culling and pose estimation, and (2)
insufficient environmental awareness in assessment and optimization strategies.
To address these issues, we propose SRR-SLAM, a scene-reliability based
framework that enhances feature-based SLAM through environment-aware
processing. Our method introduces a unified scene reliability assessment
mechanism that incorporates multiple metrics and historical observations to
guide system behavior. Based on this assessment, we develop: (i) adaptive
dynamic region selection with flexible geometric constraints, (ii)
depth-assisted self-adjusting clustering for efficient dynamic feature removal
in high-dimensional settings, and (iii) reliability-aware pose refinement that
dynamically integrates direct methods when features are insufficient.
Furthermore, we propose (iv) reliability-based keyframe selection and a
weighted optimization scheme to reduce computational overhead while improving
estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on public datasets and real world
scenarios show that SRR-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods,
achieving up to 90% improvement in accuracy and robustness across diverse
environments. These improvements directly contribute to enhanced measurement
precision and reliability in autonomous robotic sensing systems.

Conclusion: PRBM+LDM是一种计算高效且精确的软体执行器建模技术，能够实现稳定灵活的抓取和精确的力调节

Abstract: The rapid advancement in physical human-robot interaction (HRI) has
accelerated the development of soft robot designs and controllers. Controlling
soft robots, especially soft hand grasping, is challenging due to their
continuous deformation, motivating the use of reduced model-based controllers
for real-time dynamic performance. Most existing models, however, suffer from
computational inefficiency and complex parameter identification, limiting their
real-time applicability. To address this, we propose a paradigm coupling
Pseudo-Rigid Body Modeling with the Logarithmic Decrement Method for parameter
estimation (PRBM plus LDM). Using a soft robotic hand test bed, we validate
PRBM plus LDM for predicting position and force output from pressure input and
benchmark its performance. We then implement PRBM plus LDM as the basis for
closed-loop position and force controllers. Compared to a simple PID
controller, the PRBM plus LDM position controller achieves lower error (average
maximum error across all fingers: 4.37 degrees versus 20.38 degrees). For force
control, PRBM plus LDM outperforms constant pressure grasping in pinching tasks
on delicate objects: potato chip 86 versus 82.5, screwdriver 74.42 versus 70,
brass coin 64.75 versus 35. These results demonstrate PRBM plus LDM as a
computationally efficient and accurate modeling technique for soft actuators,
enabling stable and flexible grasping with precise force regulation.

Abstract: Soft robots have been increasingly utilized as sophisticated tools in
physical rehabilitation, particularly for assisting patients with neuromotor
impairments. However, many soft robotics for rehabilitation applications are
characterized by limitations such as slow response times, restricted range of
motion, and low output force. There are also limited studies on the precise
position and force control of wearable soft actuators. Furthermore, not many
studies articulate how bellow-structured actuator designs quantitatively
contribute to the robots' capability. This study introduces a paradigm of upper
limb soft actuator design. This paradigm comprises two actuators: the
Lobster-Inspired Silicone Pneumatic Robot (LISPER) for the elbow and the
Scallop-Shaped Pneumatic Robot (SCASPER) for the shoulder. LISPER is
characterized by higher bandwidth, increased output force/torque, and high
linearity. SCASPER is characterized by high output force/torque and simplified
fabrication processes. Comprehensive analytical models that describe the
relationship between pressure, bending angles, and output force for both
actuators were presented so the geometric configuration of the actuators can be
set to modify the range of motion and output forces. The preliminary test on a
dummy arm is conducted to test the capability of the actuators.

Abstract: Multi-agent distributed collaborative mapping provides comprehensive and
efficient representations for robots. However, existing approaches lack
instance-level awareness and semantic understanding of environments, limiting
their effectiveness for downstream applications. To address this issue, we
propose OpenMulti, an open-vocabulary instance-level multi-agent distributed
implicit mapping framework. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Agent Instance
Alignment module, which constructs an Instance Collaborative Graph to ensure
consistent instance understanding across agents. To alleviate the degradation
of mapping accuracy due to the blind-zone optimization trap, we leverage Cross
Rendering Supervision to enhance distributed learning of the scene.
Experimental results show that OpenMulti outperforms related algorithms in both
fine-grained geometric accuracy and zero-shot semantic accuracy. In addition,
OpenMulti supports instance-level retrieval tasks, delivering semantic
annotations for downstream applications. The project website of OpenMulti is

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for the evaluation and optimization
of autonomous vehicle trajectories, integrating formal safety, comfort, and
efficiency criteria. An innovative geometric indicator, based on the analysis
of safety zones using adaptive ellipses, is used to accurately quantify
collision risks. Our method applies the Shoelace formula to compute the
intersection area in the case of misaligned and time-varying configurations.
Comfort is modeled using indicators centered on longitudinal and lateral jerk,
while efficiency is assessed by overall travel time. These criteria are
aggregated into a comprehensive objective function solved using a PSO based
algorithm. The approach was successfully validated under real traffic
conditions via experiments conducted in an urban intersection involving an
autonomous vehicle interacting with a human-operated vehicle, and in simulation
using data recorded from human driving in real traffic.

Conclusion: 解耦多上下文元学习方法通过显式分离任务因素，提高了模型的可解释性、鲁棒性和泛化能力，在多个领域验证了其有效性

Abstract: In meta-learning and its downstream tasks, many methods rely on implicit
adaptation to task variations, where multiple factors are mixed together in a
single entangled representation. This makes it difficult to interpret which
factors drive performance and can hinder generalization. In this work, we
introduce a disentangled multi-context meta-learning framework that explicitly
assigns each task factor to a distinct context vector. By decoupling these
variations, our approach improves robustness through deeper task understanding
and enhances generalization by enabling context vector sharing across tasks
with shared factors. We evaluate our approach in two domains. First, on a
sinusoidal regression task, our model outperforms baselines on
out-of-distribution tasks and generalizes to unseen sine functions by sharing
context vectors associated with shared amplitudes or phase shifts. Second, in a
quadruped robot locomotion task, we disentangle the robot-specific properties
and the characteristics of the terrain in the robot dynamics model. By
transferring disentangled context vectors acquired from the dynamics model into
reinforcement learning, the resulting policy achieves improved robustness under
out-of-distribution conditions, surpassing the baselines that rely on a single
unified context. Furthermore, by effectively sharing context, our model enables
successful sim-to-real policy transfer to challenging terrains with
out-of-distribution robot-specific properties, using just 20 seconds of real
data from flat terrain, a result not achievable with single-task adaptation.

Abstract: Object Navigation (ObjectNav) has made great progress with large language

performance on benchmark ObjectNav datasets, with higher success rates and more
efficient paths. It particularly excels in diverse and complex environments, as
it connects temporary visual inputs with lasting spatial understanding.

Abstract: Visual SLAM has regained attention due to its ability to provide perceptual
capabilities and simulation test data for Embodied AI. However, traditional
SLAM methods struggle to meet the demands of high-quality scene reconstruction,
and Gaussian SLAM systems, despite their rapid rendering and high-quality
mapping capabilities, lack effective pose optimization methods and face
challenges in geometric reconstruction. To address these issues, we introduce
FGO-SLAM, a Gaussian SLAM system that employs an opacity radiance field as the
scene representation to enhance geometric mapping performance. After initial
pose estimation, we apply global adjustment to optimize camera poses and sparse
point cloud, ensuring robust tracking of our approach. Additionally, we
maintain a globally consistent opacity radiance field based on 3D Gaussians and
introduce depth distortion and normal consistency terms to refine the scene
representation. Furthermore, after constructing tetrahedral grids, we identify
level sets to directly extract surfaces from 3D Gaussians. Results across
various real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art tracking accuracy and mapping performance.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has become essential in various robotics applications due
to excelling at processing raw sensory data to extract task specific
information from semantic objects. For example, vision-based object-relative
navigation relies on a DL-based 6D object pose predictor to provide the
relative pose between the object and the robot as measurements to the robot's
state estimator. Accurately knowing the uncertainty inherent in such Deep
Neural Network (DNN) based measurements is essential for probabilistic state
estimators subsequently guiding the robot's tasks. Thus, in this letter, we
show that we can extend any existing DL-based object-relative pose predictor
for aleatoric uncertainty inference simply by including two multi-layer
perceptrons detached from the translational and rotational part of the DL
predictor. This allows for efficient training while freezing the existing
pre-trained predictor. We then use the inferred 6D pose and its uncertainty as
a measurement and corresponding noise covariance matrix in an extended Kalman
filter (EKF). Our approach induces minimal computational overhead such that the
state estimator can be deployed on edge devices while benefiting from the
dynamically inferred measurement uncertainty. This increases the performance of
the object-relative state estimation task compared to a fix-covariance
approach. We conduct evaluations on synthetic data and real-world data to
underline the benefits of aleatoric uncertainty inference for the
object-relative state estimation task.

Abstract: Lane change decision-making for autonomous vehicles is a complex but
high-reward behavior. In this paper, we propose a hybrid input based deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, which realizes abstract lane change
decisions and lane change actions for autonomous vehicles within traffic flow.
Firstly, a surrounding vehicles trajectory prediction method is proposed to
reduce the risk of future behavior of surrounding vehicles to ego vehicle, and
the prediction results are input into the reinforcement learning model as
additional information. Secondly, to comprehensively leverage environmental
information, the model extracts feature from high-dimensional images and
low-dimensional sensor data simultaneously. The fusion of surrounding vehicle
trajectory prediction and multi-modal information are used as state space of
reinforcement learning to improve the rationality of lane change decision.
Finally, we integrate reinforcement learning macro decisions with end-to-end
vehicle control to achieve a holistic lane change process. Experiments were
conducted within the CARLA simulator, and the results demonstrated that the
utilization of a hybrid state space significantly enhances the safety of
vehicle lane change decisions.

Abstract: This paper examines the speculative topic of equitable robots through an
exploratory essay format. It focuses specifically on robots by and for LGBTQ+
populations. It aims to provoke thought and conversations in the field about
what aspirational queer robotics futures may look like, both in the arts and
sciences. First, it briefly reviews the state-of-the-art of queer robotics in
fiction and science, drawing together threads from each. Then, it discusses
queering robots through three speculative design proposals for queer robot
roles: 1) reflecting the queerness of their ''in-group'' queer users, building
and celebrating ''in-group'' identity, 2) a new kind of queer activism by
implementing queer robot identity performance to interact with ''out-group''
users, with a goal of reducing bigotry through familiarisation, and 3) a
network of queer-owned robots, through which the community could reach each
other, and distribute and access important resources. The paper then questions
whether robots should be queered, and what ethical implications this raises.
Finally, the paper makes suggestions for what aspirational queer robotics
futures may look like, and what would be required to get there.

Conclusion: IWR方法通过概率比估计有效解决了传统检索方法的问题，在小样本模仿学习中表现出更好的性能，为检索式学习提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: While large-scale robot datasets have propelled recent progress in imitation
learning, learning from smaller task specific datasets remains critical for
deployment in new environments and unseen tasks. One such approach to few-shot
imitation learning is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts
relevant samples from large, widely available prior datasets to augment a
limited demonstration dataset. To determine the relevant data from prior
datasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data
point's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space.
While retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data
selection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel
density (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution. This reveals two
shortcomings of the retrieval rule used in prior work. First, it relies on
high-variance nearest neighbor estimates that are susceptible to noise. Second,
it does not account for the distribution of prior data when retrieving data. To
address these issues, we introduce Importance Weighted Retrieval (IWR), which
estimates importance weights, or the ratio between the target and prior data
distributions for retrieval, using Gaussian KDEs. By considering the
probability ratio, IWR seeks to mitigate the bias of previous selection rules,
and by using reasonable modeling parameters, IWR effectively smooths estimates
using all data points. Across both simulation environments and real-world
evaluations on the Bridge dataset we find that our method, IWR, consistently
improves performance of existing retrieval-based methods, despite only
requiring minor modifications.

Conclusion: MoTo成功地将固定基座操作基础模型扩展到移动操作领域，通过零样本方式实现了卓越的泛化性能，为机器人移动操作提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile manipulation stands as a core challenge in robotics, enabling robots
to assist humans across varied tasks and dynamic daily environments.
Conventional mobile manipulation approaches often struggle to generalize across
different tasks and environments due to the lack of large-scale training.
However, recent advances in manipulation foundation models demonstrate
impressive generalization capability on a wide range of fixed-base manipulation
tasks, which are still limited to a fixed setting. Therefore, we devise a
plug-in module named MoTo, which can be combined with any off-the-shelf
manipulation foundation model to empower them with mobile manipulation ability.
Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware navigation policy to generate
robot docking points for generalized mobile manipulation. To enable zero-shot
ability, we propose an interaction keypoints framework via vision-language
models (VLM) under multi-view consistency for both target object and robotic
arm following instructions, where fixed-base manipulation foundation models can
be employed. We further propose motion planning objectives for the mobile base
and robot arm, which minimize the distance between the two keypoints and
maintain the physical feasibility of trajectories. In this way, MoTo guides the
robot to move to the docking points where fixed-base manipulation can be
successfully performed, and leverages VLM generation and trajectory
optimization to achieve mobile manipulation in a zero-shot manner, without any
requirement on mobile manipulation expert data. Extensive experimental results
on OVMM and real-world demonstrate that MoTo achieves success rates of 2.68%
and 16.67% higher than the state-of-the-art mobile manipulation methods,
respectively, without requiring additional training data.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ArtiPoint是一个新颖的估计框架，通过结合深度点跟踪和因子图优化，从原始RGB-D视频中估计铰接物体模型，在动态相机运动和部分可观测条件下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的铰接估计方法主要关注受控环境，假设固定相机视角或直接观察物体状态，在无约束的真实环境中容易失败。受人类通过观察他人操作物体来推断铰接的启发，需要开发能在动态相机运动和部分可观测条件下工作的新方法。

Method: 结合深度点跟踪与因子图优化框架，直接从原始RGB-D视频中稳健估计铰接部件轨迹和铰接轴。

Result: 在Art4D数据集上对经典和基于学习的基线方法进行基准测试，证明了ArtiPoint的优越性能。

Conclusion: ArtiPoint能够有效推断铰接物体模型，特别是在动态相机运动和部分可观测条件下，为机器人场景理解、移动操作和运动规划提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Understanding the 3D motion of articulated objects is essential in robotic
scene understanding, mobile manipulation, and motion planning. Prior methods
for articulation estimation have primarily focused on controlled settings,
assuming either fixed camera viewpoints or direct observations of various
object states, which tend to fail in more realistic unconstrained environments.
In contrast, humans effortlessly infer articulation by watching others
manipulate objects. Inspired by this, we introduce ArtiPoint, a novel
estimation framework that can infer articulated object models under dynamic
camera motion and partial observability. By combining deep point tracking with
a factor graph optimization framework, ArtiPoint robustly estimates articulated
part trajectories and articulation axes directly from raw RGB-D videos. To
foster future research in this domain, we introduce Arti4D, the first
ego-centric in-the-wild dataset that captures articulated object interactions
at a scene level, accompanied by articulation labels and ground-truth camera
poses. We benchmark ArtiPoint against a range of classical and learning-based
baselines, demonstrating its superior performance on Arti4D. We make code and
Arti4D publicly available at https://artipoint.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Motivation: 现有的机器人基础模型虽然具有强大的端到端和通用能力，但缺乏明确的行为正确性和安全约束概念，存在安全隐患。

Method: 采用约束解码框架，在动作轨迹生成过程中强制执行信号时序逻辑（STL）规范，确保生成的动作在动态系统中满足逻辑约束。

Result: 在多个最先进的导航基础模型上进行了全面评估，证明该方法不仅能过滤不安全动作，还能实现条件动作生成。

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人基础模型提供了运行时安全保障，无需修改底层模型，具有良好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in the development of robotic foundation models have led to
promising end-to-end and general-purpose capabilities in robotic systems. These
models are pretrained on vast datasets of robot trajectories to process multi-
modal inputs and directly output a sequence of action that the system then
executes in the real world. Although this approach is attractive from the
perspective of im- proved generalization across diverse tasks, these models are
still data-driven and, therefore, lack explicit notions of behavioral
correctness and safety constraints. We address these limitations by introducing
a constrained decoding framework for robotics foundation models that enforces
logical constraints on action trajec- tories in dynamical systems. Our method
ensures that generated actions provably satisfy signal temporal logic (STL)
specifications at runtime without retraining, while remaining agnostic of the
underlying foundation model. We perform com- prehensive evaluation of our
approach across state-of-the-art navigation founda- tion models and we show
that our decoding-time interventions are useful not only for filtering unsafe
actions but also for conditional action-generation. Videos available on our

Conclusion: Fail2Progress在从不同数量物体的失败中学习方面表现优异，且优于多个基线方法

Abstract: Skill effect models for long-horizon manipulation tasks are prone to failures
in conditions not covered by training data distributions. Therefore, enabling
robots to reason about and learn from failures is necessary. We investigate the
problem of efficiently generating a dataset targeted to observed failures.
After fine-tuning a skill effect model on this dataset, we evaluate the extent
to which the model can recover from failures and minimize future failures. We
propose Fail2Progress, an approach that leverages Stein variational inference
to generate multiple simulation environments in parallel, enabling efficient
data sample generation similar to observed failures. Our method is capable of
handling several challenging mobile manipulation tasks, including transporting
multiple objects, organizing a constrained shelf, and tabletop organization.
Through large-scale simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that
our approach excels at learning from failures across different numbers of
objects. Furthermore, we show that Fail2Progress outperforms several baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法易于在标准RL流程中实现，适用于任何策略梯度方法，为能耗高效控制策略提供了基于原理的替代方案

Abstract: Efficient robot control often requires balancing task performance with energy
expenditure. A common approach in reinforcement learning (RL) is to penalize
energy use directly as part of the reward function. This requires carefully
tuning weight terms to avoid undesirable trade-offs where energy minimization
harms task success. In this work, we propose a hyperparameter-free gradient
optimization method to minimize energy expenditure without conflicting with
task performance. Inspired by recent works in multitask learning, our method
applies policy gradient projection between task and energy objectives to derive
policy updates that minimize energy expenditure in ways that do not impact task
performance. We evaluate this technique on standard locomotion benchmarks of
DM-Control and HumanoidBench and demonstrate a reduction of 64% energy usage
while maintaining comparable task performance. Further, we conduct experiments
on a Unitree GO2 quadruped showcasing Sim2Real transfer of energy efficient
policies. Our method is easy to implement in standard RL pipelines with minimal
code changes, is applicable to any policy gradient method, and offers a
principled alternative to reward shaping for energy efficient control policies.

Abstract: Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is essential for enhancing situational
awareness and preventing collisions. Still, existing data-driven models are
constrained mainly to single-vessel forecasting, overlooking vessel
interactions, navigation rules, and explicit collision risk assessment. We
present a transformer-based framework for multi-vessel trajectory prediction
with integrated collision risk analysis. For a given target vessel, the
framework identifies nearby vessels. It jointly predicts their future
trajectories through parallel streams encoding kinematic and derived physical
features, causal convolutions for temporal locality, spatial transformations
for positional encoding, and hybrid positional embeddings that capture both
local motion patterns and long-range dependencies. Evaluated on large-scale
real-world AIS data using joint multi-vessel metrics, the model demonstrates
superior forecasting capabilities beyond traditional single-vessel displacement
errors. By simulating interactions among predicted trajectories, the framework
further quantifies potential collision risks, offering actionable insights to
strengthen maritime safety and decision support.

Abstract: Marine ecosystems face increasing pressure due to climate change, driving the
need for scalable, AI-powered monitoring solutions. This paper examines the
rapid emergence of underwater AI as a major research frontier and analyzes the
factors that have transformed marine perception from a niche application into a
catalyst for AI innovation. We identify three convergent drivers: environmental
necessity for ecosystem-scale monitoring, democratization of underwater
datasets through citizen science platforms, and researcher migration from
saturated terrestrial computer vision domains. Our analysis reveals how unique
underwater challenges - turbidity, cryptic species detection, expert annotation
bottlenecks, and cross-ecosystem generalization - are driving fundamental
advances in weakly supervised learning, open-set recognition, and robust
perception under degraded conditions. We survey emerging trends in datasets,
scene understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the paradigm shift from
passive observation toward AI-driven, targeted intervention capabilities. The
paper demonstrates how underwater constraints are pushing the boundaries of
foundation models, self-supervised learning, and perception, with
methodological innovations that extend far beyond marine applications to
benefit general computer vision, robotics, and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in autonomous driving systems have
recently demonstrated transformative potential by integrating multimodal
perception with decision-making capabilities. However, the interpretability and
coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences
remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose
AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and
self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through
chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL).
Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K
for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between
input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain
with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and
self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework
that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness
criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive
evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed
method.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial vehicles, such as NASA's Ingenuity, enable rapid planetary
surface exploration beyond the reach of ground-based robots. Thus, NASA is
studying a Mars Science Helicopter (MSH), an advanced concept capable of
performing long-range science missions and autonomously navigating challenging
Martian terrain. Given significant Earth-Mars communication delays and mission
complexity, an advanced autonomy framework is required to ensure safe and
efficient operation by continuously adapting behavior based on mission
objectives and real-time conditions, without human intervention. This study
presents a deterministic high-level control framework for aerial exploration,
integrating a Finite State Machine (FSM) with Behavior Trees (BTs) to achieve a
scalable, robust, and computationally efficient autonomy solution for critical
scenarios like deep space exploration. In this paper we outline key
capabilities of a possible MSH and detail the FSM-BT hybrid autonomy framework
which orchestrates them to achieve the desired objectives. Monte Carlo
simulations and real field tests validate the framework, demonstrating its
robustness and adaptability to both discrete events and real-time system
feedback. These inputs trigger state transitions or dynamically adjust behavior
execution, enabling reactive and context-aware responses. The framework is
middleware-agnostic, supporting integration with systems like F-Prime and
extending beyond aerial robotics.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a framework for designing sliding mode controllers
for a class of mechanical systems with symmetry, both unconstrained and
constrained, that evolve on principal fiber bundles. Control laws are developed
based on the reduced motion equations by exploring symmetries, leading to a
sliding mode control strategy where the reaching stage is executed on the base
space, and the sliding stage is performed on the structure group. Thus, design
complexity is reduced, and difficult choices for coordinate representations
when working with a particular Lie group are avoided. For this purpose, a
sliding subgroup is constructed on the structure group based on a kinematic
controller, and the sliding variable will converge to the identity of the state
manifold upon reaching the sliding subgroup. A reaching law based on a general
sliding vector field is then designed on the base space using the local form of
the mechanical connection to drive the sliding variable to the sliding
subgroup, and its time evolution is given according to the appropriate

Abstract: Effective human-robot interaction (HRI) in multi-object teleoperation tasks
faces significant challenges due to perceptual ambiguities in virtual reality
(VR) environments and the limitations of single-modality intention recognition.
This paper proposes a shared control framework that combines a virtual
admittance (VA) model with a Multimodal-CNN-based Human Intention Perception
Network (MMIPN) to enhance teleoperation performance and user experience. The
VA model employs artificial potential fields to guide operators toward target
objects by adjusting admittance force and optimizing motion trajectories. MMIPN
processes multimodal inputs, including gaze movement, robot motions, and
environmental context, to estimate human grasping intentions, helping to
overcome depth perception challenges in VR. Our user study evaluated four
conditions across two factors, and the results showed that MMIPN significantly
improved grasp success rates, while the VA model enhanced movement efficiency
by reducing path lengths. Gaze data emerged as the most crucial input modality.
These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal cues with
implicit guidance in VR-based teleoperation, providing a robust solution for
multi-object grasping tasks and enabling more natural interactions across
various applications in the future.

Abstract: Deep learning-based LiDAR odometry is crucial for autonomous driving and
robotic navigation, yet its performance under adverse weather, especially
snowfall, remains challenging. Existing models struggle to generalize across
conditions due to sensitivity to snow-induced noise, limiting real-world use.
In this work, we present an unsupervised LiDAR odometry model to close the gap
between clear and snowy weather conditions. Our approach focuses on effective
denoising to mitigate the impact of snowflake noise and outlier points on pose
estimation, while also maintaining computational efficiency for real-time
applications.
  To achieve this, we introduce a Patch Spatial Measure (PSM) module that
evaluates the dispersion of points within each patch, enabling effective
detection of sparse and discrete noise.
  We further propose a Patch Point Weight Predictor (PPWP) to assign adaptive
point-wise weights, enhancing their discriminative capacity within local
regions. To support real-time performance, we first apply an intensity
threshold mask to quickly suppress dense snowflake clusters near the LiDAR, and
then perform multi-modal feature fusion to refine the point-wise weight
prediction, improving overall robustness under adverse weather. Our model is
trained in clear weather conditions and rigorously tested across various
scenarios, including snowy and dynamic. Extensive experimental results confirm
the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating robust performance in both clear
and snowy weather. This advancement enhances the model's generalizability and
paves the way for more reliable autonomous systems capable of operating across
a wider range of environmental conditions.

TL;DR: ATE是一个数据高效、即插即用的VLA模型适配框架，通过构建统一潜在空间和对齐动作分布来解决跨具身和跨任务的操作问题，显著提升多任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Vision-Language-Action模型在预训练后难以有效适应下游任务，特别是在机器人具身或任务与预训练数据存在差异时，导致动作分布不匹配，需要大量数据和计算资源进行微调。

Method: 提出ATE框架：首先通过变分自编码器构建统一潜在空间，使用反向KL散度约束将适配动作嵌入到预训练动作分布的模态中；然后通过引导机制在微调过程中引导扩散或基于流的VLA生成过程，使其输出分布向目标域靠近。

Result: 在仿真环境中平均多任务成功率提升9.8%，在真实世界跨具身设置中实现了32%的成功率增益，显著优于直接微调方法。

Conclusion: ATE提供了一个通用且轻量级的解决方案，极大增强了VLA模型部署到新机器人平台和任务的实用性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models pre-trained on large, diverse datasets
show remarkable potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation. However, a
primary bottleneck remains in adapting these models to downstream tasks,
especially when the robot's embodiment or the task itself differs from the
pre-training data. This discrepancy leads to a significant mismatch in action
distributions, demanding extensive data and compute for effective fine-tuning.
To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{Align-Then-stEer
(\texttt{ATE})}, a novel, data-efficient, and plug-and-play adaptation
framework. \texttt{ATE} first aligns disparate action spaces by constructing a
unified latent space, where a variational autoencoder constrained by reverse KL
divergence embeds adaptation actions into modes of the pre-training action
latent distribution. Subsequently, it steers the diffusion- or flow-based VLA's
generation process during fine-tuning via a guidance mechanism that pushes the
model's output distribution towards the target domain. We conduct extensive
experiments on cross-embodiment and cross-task manipulation in both simulation
and real world. Compared to direct fine-tuning of representative VLAs, our
method improves the average multi-task success rate by up to \textbf{9.8\%} in
simulation and achieves a striking \textbf{32\% success rate gain} in a
real-world cross-embodiment setting. Our work presents a general and
lightweight solution that greatly enhances the practicality of deploying VLA
models to new robotic platforms and tasks.

Motivation: 传统的基础惯性参数识别方法缺乏清晰的几何解释，计算复杂度较高，特别是在并联机构(PKM)中表现不佳。需要开发一种具有几何直观性、计算高效且通用的参数识别方法。

Result: 在Puma560、Unitree Go2和两种并联机构(2RRU-1RRS、2PRS-1PSR PKM)上成功识别了完整的基础参数集。方法表现出高鲁棒性和计算效率，特别在并联机构中效果显著。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性、鲁棒性和高效性，为机器人系统的基础惯性参数识别提供了几何直观的解析解决方案，特别适用于复杂并联机构的参数识别问题。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel geometric method for analytically determining the
base inertial parameters of robotic systems. The rigid body dynamics is
reformulated using projective geometric algebra, leading to a new
identification model named ``tetrahedral-point (TP)" model. Based on the rigid
body TP model, coefficients in the regresoor matrix of the identification model
are derived in closed-form, exhibiting clear geometric interpretations.
Building directly from the dynamic model, three foundational principles for
base parameter analysis are proposed: the shared points principle, fixed points
principle, and planar rotations principle. With these principles, algorithms
are developed to automatically determine all the base parameters. The core
algorithm, referred to as Dynamics Regressor Nullspace Generator (DRNG),
achieves $O(1)$-complexity theoretically following an $O(N)$-complexity
preprocessing stage, where $N$ is the number of rigid bodies. The proposed
method and algorithms are validated across four robots: Puma560, Unitree Go2, a
2RRU-1RRS parallel kinematics mechanism (PKM), and a 2PRS-1PSR PKM. In all
cases, the algorithms successfully identify the complete set of base
parameters. Notably, the approach demonstrates high robustness and
computational efficiency, particularly in the cases of PKMs. Through the
comprehensive demonstrations, the method is shown to be general, robust, and
efficient.

Abstract: Social robotic navigation has been at the center of numerous studies in
recent years. Most of the research has focused on driving the robotic agent
along obstacle-free trajectories, respecting social distances from humans, and
predicting their movements to optimize navigation. However, in order to really
be socially accepted, the robots must be able to attain certain social norms
that cannot arise from conventional navigation, but require a dedicated
learning process. We propose Heuristic Planning with Learned Social Value
(HPLSV), a method to learn a value function encapsulating the cost of social
navigation, and use it as an additional heuristic in heuristic-search path
planning. In this preliminary work, we apply the methodology to the common
social scenario of joining a queue of people, with the intention of
generalizing to further human activities.

Abstract: The performance of industrial robotic work cells depends on optimizing
various hyperparameters referring to the cell layout, such as robot base
placement, tool placement, and kinematic design. Achieving this requires a
bilevel optimization approach, where the high-level optimization adjusts these
hyperparameters, and the low-level optimization computes robot motions.
However, computing the optimal robot motion is computationally infeasible,
introducing trade-offs in motion planning to make the problem tractable. These
trade-offs significantly impact the overall performance of the bilevel
optimization, but their effects still need to be systematically evaluated. In
this paper, we introduce metrics to assess these trade-offs regarding
optimality, time gain, robustness, and consistency. Through extensive
simulation studies, we investigate how simplifications in motion-level
optimization affect the high-level optimization outcomes, balancing
computational complexity with solution quality. The proposed algorithms are
applied to find the time-optimal kinematic design for a modular robot in two
palletization scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate and robust environmental perception is crucial for robot autonomous
navigation. While current methods typically adopt optical sensors (e.g.,
camera, LiDAR) as primary sensing modalities, their susceptibility to visual
occlusion often leads to degraded performance or complete system failure. In
this paper, we focus on agricultural scenarios where robots are exposed to the
risk of onboard sensor contamination. Leveraging radar's strong penetration
capability, we introduce a radar-based 3D environmental perception framework as
a viable alternative. It comprises three core modules designed for dense and
accurate semantic perception: 1) Parallel frame accumulation to enhance
signal-to-noise ratio of radar raw data. 2) A diffusion model-based
hierarchical learning framework that first filters radar sidelobe artifacts
then generates fine-grained 3D semantic point clouds. 3) A specifically
designed sparse 3D network optimized for processing large-scale radar raw data.
We conducted extensive benchmark comparisons and experimental evaluations on a
self-built dataset collected in real-world agricultural field scenes. Results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior structural and semantic
prediction performance compared to existing methods, while simultaneously
reducing computational and memory costs by 51.3% and 27.5%, respectively.
Furthermore, our approach achieves complete reconstruction and accurate
classification of thin structures such as poles and wires-which existing
methods struggle to perceive-highlighting its potential for dense and accurate
3D radar perception.

Abstract: Language-guided long-horizon manipulation of deformable objects presents
significant challenges due to high degrees of freedom, complex dynamics, and
the need for accurate vision-language grounding. In this work, we focus on
multi-step cloth folding, a representative deformable-object manipulation task
that requires both structured long-horizon planning and fine-grained visual
perception. To this end, we propose a unified framework that integrates a Large
Language Model (LLM)-based planner, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based
perception system, and a task execution module. Specifically, the LLM-based
planner decomposes high-level language instructions into low-level action
primitives, bridging the semantic-execution gap, aligning perception with
action, and enhancing generalization. The VLM-based perception module employs a
SigLIP2-driven architecture with a bidirectional cross-attention fusion
mechanism and weight-decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) fine-tuning to
achieve language-conditioned fine-grained visual grounding. Experiments in both
simulation and real-world settings demonstrate the method's effectiveness. In
simulation, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 2.23, 1.87, and 33.3
on seen instructions, unseen instructions, and unseen tasks, respectively. On a

Abstract: Optical microrobots actuated by optical tweezers (OT) offer great potential
for biomedical applications such as cell manipulation and microscale assembly.
These tasks demand accurate three-dimensional perception to ensure precise
control in complex and dynamic biological environments. However, the
transparent nature of microrobots and low-contrast microscopic imaging
challenge conventional deep learning methods, which also require large
annotated datasets that are costly to obtain. To address these challenges, we
propose a physics-informed, data-efficient framework for depth estimation of
optical microrobots. Our method augments convolutional feature extraction with
physics-based focus metrics, such as entropy, Laplacian of Gaussian, and
gradient sharpness, calculated using an adaptive grid strategy. This approach
allocates finer grids over microrobot regions and coarser grids over background
areas, enhancing depth sensitivity while reducing computational complexity. We
evaluate our framework on multiple microrobot types and demonstrate significant
improvements over baseline models. Specifically, our approach reduces mean
squared error (MSE) by over 60% and improves the coefficient of determination
(R^2) across all test cases. Notably, even when trained on only 20% of the

Abstract: Indoor built environments like homes and offices often present complex and
cluttered layouts that pose significant challenges for individuals who are
blind or visually impaired, especially when performing tasks that involve
locating and gathering multiple objects. While many existing assistive

assistive mobile robot system that combines natural language understanding with
vision-language foundation models (VLM), frontier-based exploration, and a
Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) planner. OpenGuide
interprets open-vocabulary requests, reasons about object-scene relationships,
and adaptively navigates and localizes multiple target items in novel
environments. Our approach enables robust recovery from missed detections
through value decay and belief-space reasoning, resulting in more effective
exploration and object localization. We validate OpenGuide in simulated and
real-world experiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in task success
rate and search efficiency over prior methods. This work establishes a
foundation for scalable, human-centered robotic assistance in assisted living

Abstract: We propose U-Arm, a low-cost and rapidly adaptable leader-follower
teleoperation framework designed to interface with most of commercially
available robotic arms. Our system supports teleoperation through three
structurally distinct 3D-printed leader arms that share consistent control
logic, enabling seamless compatibility with diverse commercial robot
configurations. Compared with previous open-source leader-follower interfaces,
we further optimized both the mechanical design and servo selection, achieving
a bill of materials (BOM) cost of only \$50.5 for the 6-DoF leader arm and
\$56.8 for the 7-DoF version. To enhance usability, we mitigate the common
challenge in controlling redundant degrees of freedom by %engineering methods
mechanical and control optimizations. Experimental results demonstrate that
U-Arm achieves 39\% higher data collection efficiency and comparable task
success rates across multiple manipulation scenarios compared with Joycon,
another low-cost teleoperation interface. We have open-sourced all CAD models
of three configs and also provided simulation support for validating
teleoperation workflows. We also open-sourced real-world manipulation data

*Steven Swanbeck,Mitch Pryor*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Coral是一个机器人软件抽象层，通过最大化组件可组合性来解决系统集成难题，无需修改底层代码即可快速集成独立软件组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人软件集成耗时且困难，现有系统通常紧密耦合，即使是小的修改也需要大量工程投入，阻碍了性能改进、任务调整和新硬件部署。

Method: Coral作为抽象层，通过引入高层次语义约束来补充现有工具，限制集成过程到有语义意义的选择，减少配置负担同时保持对不同领域、系统和任务的适应性。

Result: 在LiDAR SLAM和多机器人腐蚀缓解等复杂场景中验证了Coral的实用性，展示了其能够实现实际的可组合性。

Conclusion: Coral为广泛的机器人系统集成挑战提供了可扩展解决方案，提高了组件可重用性、系统可重构性，并使专家和非专家用户都能更容易地使用机器人软件。

Abstract: Despite the multitude of excellent software components and tools available in
the robotics and broader software engineering communities, successful
integration of software for robotic systems remains a time-consuming and
challenging task for users of all knowledge and skill levels. And with robotics
software often being built into tightly coupled, monolithic systems, even minor
alterations to improve performance, adjust to changing task requirements, or
deploy to new hardware can require significant engineering investment. To help
solve this problem, this paper presents Coral, an abstraction layer for
building, deploying, and coordinating independent software components that
maximizes composability to allow for rapid system integration without modifying
low-level code. Rather than replacing existing tools, Coral complements them by
introducing a higher-level abstraction that constrains the integration process
to semantically meaningful choices, reducing the configuration burden without
limiting adaptability to diverse domains, systems, and tasks. We describe Coral
in detail and demonstrate its utility in integrating software for scenarios of
increasing complexity, including LiDAR-based SLAM and multi-robot corrosion
mitigation tasks. By enabling practical composability in robotics software,
Coral offers a scalable solution to a broad range of robotics system
integration challenges, improving component reusability, system
reconfigurability, and accessibility to both expert and non-expert users. We
release Coral open source.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的视觉触觉传感器分类方法，将其分为基于标记物转换原理和基于强度转换原理两大类，并对四种子类型进行了比较研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉触觉传感器在机器人领域应用广泛，但缺乏统一的分类标准。不同传感器在传感原理、材料组成和多模态方法上存在差异，需要系统性的分类框架来指导研究和应用。

Method: 提出基于接触转换为触觉图像的转换原理进行分类：标记物转换原理（检测标记位移和密度变化）和强度转换原理（通过像素值变化映射外部扰动）。进一步细分为简单标记基、形态标记基、反射层基和透明层基四种机制。

Result: 建立了系统的视觉触觉传感器分类框架，对四种传感器类型的硬件特性进行了比较分析，并讨论了常用的触觉信息解释方法。

Conclusion: 该分类方法为视觉触觉传感器技术提供了统一的分析框架，揭示了当前技术面临的挑战，并指明了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTS) have gained widespread application in
robotic hands, grippers and prosthetics due to their high spatial resolution,
low manufacturing costs, and ease of customization. While VBTSs have common
design features, such as a camera module, they can differ in a rich diversity
of sensing principles, material compositions, multimodal approaches, and data
interpretation methods. Here, we propose a novel classification of VBTS that
categorizes the technology into two primary sensing principles based on the
underlying transduction of contact into a tactile image: the Marker-Based
Transduction Principle and the Intensity-Based Transduction Principle.
Marker-Based Transduction interprets tactile information by detecting marker
displacement and changes in marker density. In contrast, Intensity-Based
Transduction maps external disturbances with variations in pixel values.
Depending on the design of the contact module, Marker-Based Transduction can be
further divided into two subtypes: Simple Marker-Based (SMB) and Morphological
Marker-Based (MMB) mechanisms. Similarly, the Intensity-Based Transduction
Principle encompasses the Reflective Layer-based (RLB) and Transparent
Layer-Based (TLB) mechanisms. This paper provides a comparative study of the
hardware characteristics of these four types of sensors including various
combination types, and discusses the commonly used methods for interpreting
tactile information. This~comparison reveals some current challenges faced by
VBTS technology and directions for future research.

TL;DR: 通过模拟深度摄像头噪声模型训练Camera Depth Models(CDMs)，在真实环境中实现了高精度深度预测，为机器人操控任务提供了更好的三维视觉感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器人操控主要依靠RGB图像，在精确度和通用性方面有限。深度摄像头虽能提供3D几何信息，但受到噪声和准确性问题的限制。需要一种方法来提高深度数据的质量以支持更好的操控性能。

Method: 提出Camera Depth Models(CDMs)，作为深度摄像头的插件，输入RGB图像和原始深度信号，输出去噪后的准确深度。通过模拟环境建立神经数据引擎，模拟深度摄像头的噪声模式来生成高质量的训练数据。

Result: CDMs在深度预测上达到了接近模拟级别的准确度，有效缩小了模拟与真实之间的差距。在包含关节、反射和细长物体的长期限任务中，使用模拟深度训练的策略能够无缝迁移到真实机器人，性能减少微小或无减少。

Conclusion: 该方法为利用模拟数据和3D信息来提高机器人操控策略的通用性开启了新方向，显示了通过深度数据处理可以实现更好的现实世界逆向工程和策略迁移。

Abstract: Modern robotic manipulation primarily relies on visual observations in a 2D
color space for skill learning but suffers from poor generalization. In
contrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such
as distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects.
Since such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth
cameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual
capabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation
is challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to
various types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as
a simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth
signals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this,
we develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from
simulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that
CDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively
bridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments
demonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth,
without the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes
seamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving
articulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance
degradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing
simulation data and 3D information in general robot policies.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel curve-based slicing method for generating
planar layers with dynamically varying orientations in digital light processing
(DLP) 3D printing. Our approach effectively addresses key challenges in DLP
printing, such as regions with large overhangs and staircase artifacts, while
preserving its intrinsic advantages of high resolution and fast printing
speeds. We formulate the slicing problem as an optimization task, in which
parametric curves are computed to define both the slicing layers and the model
partitioning through their tangent planes. These curves inherently define
motion trajectories for the build platform and can be optimized to meet
critical manufacturing objectives, including collision-free motion and
floating-free deposition. We validate our method through physical experiments
on a robotic multi-axis DLP printing setup, demonstrating that the optimized
curves can robustly guide smooth, high-quality fabrication of complex
geometries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型加速方法未能充分利用说话头部生成任务中的时空冗余特性，导致推理速度慢，限制了实际应用

Method: LightningCP：缓存静态特征实现并行去噪预测；解耦前景注意力(DFA)：利用空间解耦特性限制注意力计算到动态前景区域；移除某些层的参考特征

Abstract: Diffusion-based talking head models generate high-quality, photorealistic
videos but suffer from slow inference, limiting practical applications.
Existing acceleration methods for general diffusion models fail to exploit the
temporal and spatial redundancies unique to talking head generation. In this
paper, we propose a task-specific framework addressing these inefficiencies
through two key innovations. First, we introduce Lightning-fast Caching-based
Parallel denoising prediction (LightningCP), caching static features to bypass
most model layers in inference time. We also enable parallel prediction using
cached features and estimated noisy latents as inputs, efficiently bypassing
sequential sampling. Second, we propose Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA) to
further accelerate attention computations, exploiting the spatial decoupling in
talking head videos to restrict attention to dynamic foreground regions.
Additionally, we remove reference features in certain layers to bring extra
speedup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves inference speed while preserving video quality.

Motivation: 曲线表示（特别是积分曲线）常用于大规模计算流体动力学模拟，但现有邻近搜索策略在处理曲线型向量场数据时经常返回偏差和冗余的邻近段，缺乏系统研究不同搜索策略配置对后续任务影响的研究。

Method: 通过大量重建测试和显著性计算，评估两种流行邻近搜索策略与不同距离度量的组合性能，提出平均邻近距离和均匀性等度量指标来表征邻近段配置。

Result: 研究获得了部分证实理想邻近配置预期的观察结果，同时揭示了被学术界忽视的额外发现。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了邻近搜索策略配置对后续任务影响研究的空白，为曲线型向量场数据处理提供了重要的方法论指导。

Abstract: Curve-based representations, particularly integral curves, are often used to
represent large-scale computational fluid dynamic simulations. Processing and
analyzing curve-based vector field data sets often involves searching for
neighboring segments given a query point or curve segment. However, because the
original flow behavior may not be fully represented by the set of integral
curves and the input integral curves may not be evenly distributed in space,
popular neighbor search strategies often return skewed and redundant
neighboring segments. Yet, there is a lack of systematic and comprehensive
research on how different configurations of neighboring segments returned by
specific neighbor search strategies affect subsequent tasks. To fill this gap,
this study evaluates the performance of two popular neighbor search strategies
combined with different distance metrics on a point-based vector field
reconstruction task and a segment saliency estimation using input integral
curves. A large number of reconstruction tests and saliency calculations are
conducted for the study. To characterize the configurations of neighboring
segments for an effective comparison of different search strategies, a number
of measures, like average neighbor distance and uniformity, are proposed. Our
study leads to a few observations that partially confirm our expectations about
the ideal configurations of a neighborhood while revealing additional findings
that were overlooked by the community.

Abstract: Despite the recent success of multi-view diffusion models for
text/image-based 3D asset generation, instruction-based editing of 3D assets
lacks surprisingly far behind the quality of generation models. The main reason
is that recent approaches using 2D priors suffer from view-inconsistent editing
signals. Going beyond 2D prior distillation methods and multi-view editing
strategies, we propose a training-free editing method that operates within the
latent space of a native 3D diffusion model, allowing us to directly manipulate
3D geometry. We guide the edit synthesis by blending 3D attention maps from the
generation with the source object. Coupled with geometry-aware regularization
guidance, a spectral modulation strategy in the Fourier domain and a refinement
step for 3D enhancement, our method outperforms previous 3D editing methods
enabling high-fidelity, precise, and robust edits across a wide range of shapes
and semantic manipulations.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种高性能的自动微分系统，专门为三角网格函数设计，通过GPU并行计算实现了迅速的梯度和Hessian矩阵计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的自动微分方法在处理网格能量函数时效率低下，需要构建全局计算图并产生大量内存交互，而网格函数具有本质的稀疏性和局部性，可以被更高效利用。

Method: 系统采用每元素前向模式微分，让所有局部计算保持在GPU寄存器或共享内存中。与反向模式不同，该方法在运行时进行微分，减少内存交互和避免全局同步。用户只需定义局部能量项，系统处理并行计算、导数计算和稀疏Hessian矩阵组装。

Result: 在多个应用中进行测试：衣服模拟、表面参数化、网格平滑和球面优化。二阶导数计算比优化的PyTorch实现快6.2倍，Hessian-向量乘积快2.76倍。一阶导数计算比Warp快6.38倍，比JAX快2.89倍，比Dr.JIT快1.98倍，性能与手写导数相当。

Abstract: We present a high-performance system for automatic differentiation (AD) of
functions defined on triangle meshes that exploits the inherent sparsity and
locality of mesh-based energy functions to achieve fast gradient and Hessian
computation on the GPU. Our system is designed around per-element forward-mode
differentiation, enabling all local computations to remain in GPU registers or
shared memory. Unlike reverse-mode approaches that construct and traverse
global computation graphs, our method performs differentiation on the fly,
minimizing memory traffic and avoiding global synchronization. Our programming
model allows users to define local energy terms while the system handles
parallel evaluation, derivative computation, and sparse Hessian assembly. We
benchmark our system on a range of applications--cloth simulation, surface
parameterization, mesh smoothing, and spherical manifold optimization. We
achieve a geometric mean speedup of 6.2x over optimized PyTorch implementations
for second-order derivatives, and 2.76x speedup for Hessian-vector products.
For first-order derivatives, our system is 6.38x, 2.89x, and 1.98x faster than
Warp, JAX, and Dr.JIT, respectively, while remaining on par with hand-written
derivatives.

Abstract: Diffusion-based Image Editing has achieved significant success in recent
years. However, it remains challenging to achieve high-quality image editing
while maintaining the background similarity without sacrificing speed or memory
efficiency. In this work, we introduce LatentEdit, an adaptive latent fusion
framework that dynamically combines the current latent code with a reference
latent code inverted from the source image. By selectively preserving source
features in high-similarity, semantically important regions while generating
target content in other regions guided by the target prompt, LatentEdit enables
fine-grained, controllable editing. Critically, the method requires no internal
model modifications or complex attention mechanisms, offering a lightweight,
plug-and-play solution compatible with both UNet-based and DiT-based
architectures. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench dataset demonstrate that
our proposed LatentEdit achieves an optimal balance between fidelity and
editability, outperforming the state-of-the-art method even in 8-15 steps.
Additionally, its inversion-free variant further halves the number of neural
function evaluations and eliminates the need for storing any intermediate
variables, substantially enhancing real-time deployment efficiency.

Abstract: Estimating albedo (a.k.a., intrinsic image decomposition) from single RGB
images captured in real-world environments (e.g., the MVImgNet dataset)
presents a significant challenge due to the absence of paired images and their
ground truth albedos. Therefore, while recent methods (e.g., IntrinsicAnything)
have achieved breakthroughs by harnessing powerful diffusion priors, they
remain predominantly trained on large-scale synthetic datasets (e.g.,
Objaverse) and applied directly to real-world RGB images, which ignores the
large domain gap between synthetic and real-world data and leads to suboptimal
generalization performance. In this work, we address this gap by proposing
IntrinsicReal, a novel domain adaptation framework that bridges the
above-mentioned domain gap for real-world intrinsic image decomposition.
Specifically, our IntrinsicReal adapts IntrinsicAnything to the real domain by
fine-tuning it using its high-quality output albedos selected by a novel dual
pseudo-labeling strategy: i) pseudo-labeling with an absolute confidence
threshold on classifier predictions, and ii) pseudo-labeling using the relative
preference ranking of classifier predictions for individual input objects. This
strategy is inspired by human evaluation, where identifying the highest-quality
outputs is straightforward, but absolute scores become less reliable for
sub-optimal cases. In these situations, relative comparisons of outputs become
more accurate. To implement this, we propose a novel two-phase pipeline that
sequentially applies these pseudo-labeling techniques to effectively adapt
IntrinsicAnything to the real domain. Experimental results show that our
IntrinsicReal significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art results for albedo estimation on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Abstract: Generative models for high-quality materials are particularly desirable to
make 3D content authoring more accessible. However, the majority of material
generation methods are trained on synthetic data. Synthetic data provides
precise supervision for material maps, which is convenient but also tends to
create a significant visual gap with real-world materials. Alternatively,
recent work used a small dataset of real flash photographs to guarantee
realism, however such data is limited in scale and diversity. To address these
limitations, we propose RealMat, a diffusion-based material generator that
leverages realistic priors, including a text-to-image model and a dataset of
realistic material photos under natural lighting. In RealMat, we first finetune
a pretrained Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) with synthetic material maps arranged
in $2 \times 2$ grids. This way, our model inherits some realism of SDXL while
learning the data distribution of the synthetic material grids. Still, this
creates a realism gap, with some generated materials appearing synthetic. We
propose to further finetune our model through reinforcement learning (RL),
encouraging the generation of realistic materials. We develop a realism reward
function for any material image under natural lighting, by collecting a
large-scale dataset of realistic material images. We show that this approach
increases generated materials' realism compared to our base model and related
work.

Abstract: Currently, prominent Transformer architectures applied on graphs and meshes
for shape analysis tasks employ traditional attention layers that heavily
utilize spectral features requiring costly eigenvalue decomposition-based
methods. To encode the mesh structure, these methods derive positional
embeddings, that heavily rely on eigenvalue decomposition based operations,
e.g. on the Laplacian matrix, or on heat-kernel signatures, which are then
concatenated to the input features. This paper proposes a novel approach
inspired by the explicit construction of the Hodge Laplacian operator in
Discrete Exterior Calculus as a product of discrete Hodge operators and
exterior derivatives, i.e. $(L := \star_0^{-1} d_0^T \star_1 d_0)$. We adjust
the Transformer architecture in a novel deep learning layer that utilizes the
multi-head attention mechanism to approximate Hodge matrices $\star_0$,
$\star_1$ and $\star_2$ and learn families of discrete operators $L$ that act
on mesh vertices, edges and faces. Our approach results in a
computationally-efficient architecture that achieves comparable performance in
mesh segmentation and classification tasks, through a direct learning
framework, while eliminating the need for costly eigenvalue decomposition
operations or complex preprocessing operations.

Abstract: 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) enable controllable facial geometry and
expression editing for reconstruction, animation, and AR/VR, but traditional
PCA-based mesh models are limited in resolution, detail, and photorealism.
Neural volumetric methods improve realism but remain too slow for interactive
use. Recent Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based facial models achieve fast,
high-quality rendering but still depend solely on a mesh-based 3DMM prior for
expression control, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained geometry,
expressions, and full-head coverage. We introduce GRMM, the first full-head
Gaussian 3D morphable model that augments a base 3DMM with residual geometry
and appearance components, additive refinements that recover high-frequency
details such as wrinkles, fine skin texture, and hairline variations. GRMM
provides disentangled control through low-dimensional, interpretable parameters
(e.g., identity shape, facial expressions) while separately modelling residuals
that capture subject- and expression-specific detail beyond the base model's
capacity. Coarse decoders produce vertex-level mesh deformations, fine decoders
represent per-Gaussian appearance, and a lightweight CNN refines rasterised
images for enhanced realism, all while maintaining 75 FPS real-time rendering.
To learn consistent, high-fidelity residuals, we present EXPRESS-50, the first
dataset with 60 aligned expressions across 50 identities, enabling robust
disentanglement of identity and expression in Gaussian-based 3DMMs. Across
monocular 3D face reconstruction, novel-view synthesis, and expression
transfer, GRMM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in fidelity and expression
accuracy while delivering interactive real-time performance.

Conclusion: Think2Sing通过创新的运动字幕技术和运动强度预测框架，成功解决了歌唱驱动3D头部动画的挑战，为虚拟化身、娱乐和教育应用提供了高质量的解决方案

Abstract: Singing-driven 3D head animation is a challenging yet promising task with
applications in virtual avatars, entertainment, and education. Unlike speech,
singing involves richer emotional nuance, dynamic prosody, and lyric-based
semantics, requiring the synthesis of fine-grained, temporally coherent facial
motion. Existing speech-driven approaches often produce oversimplified,
emotionally flat, and semantically inconsistent results, which are insufficient
for singing animation. To address this, we propose Think2Sing, a
diffusion-based framework that leverages pretrained large language models to
generate semantically coherent and temporally consistent 3D head animations,
conditioned on both lyrics and acoustics. A key innovation is the introduction
of motion subtitles, an auxiliary semantic representation derived through a
novel Singing Chain-of-Thought reasoning process combined with acoustic-guided
retrieval. These subtitles contain precise timestamps and region-specific
motion descriptions, serving as interpretable motion priors. We frame the task
as a motion intensity prediction problem, enabling finer control over facial
regions and improving the modeling of expressive motion. To support this, we
create a multimodal singing dataset with synchronized video, acoustic
descriptors, and motion subtitles, enabling diverse and expressive motion
learning. Extensive experiments show that Think2Sing outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in realism, expressiveness, and emotional fidelity,
while also offering flexible, user-controllable animation editing.

Abstract: Following rapid advancements in text and image generation, research has
increasingly shifted towards 3D generation. Unlike the well-established
pixel-based representation in images, 3D representations remain diverse and
fragmented, encompassing a wide variety of approaches such as voxel grids,
neural radiance fields, signed distance functions, point clouds, or octrees,
each offering distinct advantages and limitations. In this work, we present a
unified evaluation framework designed to assess the performance of 3D
representations in reconstruction and generation. We compare these
representations based on multiple criteria: quality, computational efficiency,
and generalization performance. Beyond standard model benchmarking, our
experiments aim to derive best practices over all steps involved in the 3D
generation pipeline, including preprocessing, mesh reconstruction, compression
with autoencoders, and generation. Our findings highlight that reconstruction
errors significantly impact overall performance, underscoring the need to
evaluate generation and reconstruction jointly. We provide insights that can
inform the selection of suitable 3D models for various applications,
facilitating the development of more robust and application-specific solutions
in 3D generation. The code for our framework is available at
https://github.com/isl-org/unifi3d.
