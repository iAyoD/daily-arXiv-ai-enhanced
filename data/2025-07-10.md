Motivation: 水下图像质量受光吸收和散射影响，现有深度学习方法忽视人类感知且缺乏解空间约束，导致增强图像感知质量下降或内容恢复不佳。

Method: 利用CLIP模型的视觉语义特征提取能力学习提示对，构建感知损失模块；结合课程对比正则化，增强CLIP感知空间约束，避免欠增强或过增强。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉质量和泛化能力上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合CLIP感知和课程对比正则化的方法有效提升了水下图像增强的感知质量和内容恢复能力。

Abstract: High-quality underwater images are essential for both machine vision tasks
and viewers with their aesthetic appeal.However, the quality of underwater
images is severely affected by light absorption and scattering. Deep
learning-based methods for Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) have achieved
good performance. However, these methods often overlook considering human
perception and lack sufficient constraints within the solution space.
Consequently, the enhanced images often suffer from diminished perceptual
quality or poor content restoration.To address these issues, we propose a UIE
method with a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perception loss
module and curriculum contrastive regularization. Above all, to develop a
perception model for underwater images that more aligns with human visual
perception, the visual semantic feature extraction capability of the CLIP model
is leveraged to learn an appropriate prompt pair to map and evaluate the
quality of underwater images. This CLIP perception model is then incorporated
as a perception loss module into the enhancement network to improve the
perceptual quality of enhanced images. Furthermore, the CLIP perception model
is integrated with the curriculum contrastive regularization to enhance the
constraints imposed on the enhanced images within the CLIP perceptual space,
mitigating the risk of both under-enhancement and over-enhancement.
Specifically, the CLIP perception model is employed to assess and categorize
the learning difficulty level of negatives in the regularization process,
ensuring comprehensive and nuanced utilization of distorted images and
negatives with varied quality levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and
generalization ability.

*Liqiang Jing,Viet Lai,Seunghyun Yoon,Trung Bui,Xinya Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FIFA框架，用于评估视频多模态大语言模型的忠实性，并通过后修正减少幻觉内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法局限于单一任务且无法评估开放回答中的幻觉问题。

Method: FIFA框架提取描述性事实，建模语义依赖关系，并通过视频问答模型验证；后修正框架修正幻觉内容。

Result: FIFA比现有方法更接近人类判断，后修正显著提升文本和视频生成的事实一致性。

Conclusion: FIFA和后修正框架有效解决了视频多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (VideoMLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in both Video-to-Text and Text-to-Video tasks. However, they often
suffer fro hallucinations, generating content that contradicts the visual
input. Existing evaluation methods are limited to one task (e.g., V2T) and also
fail to assess hallucinations in open-ended, free-form responses. To address
this gap, we propose FIFA, a unified FaIthFulness evAluation framework that
extracts comprehensive descriptive facts, models their semantic dependencies
via a Spatio-Temporal Semantic Dependency Graph, and verifies them using
VideoQA models. We further introduce Post-Correction, a tool-based correction
framework that revises hallucinated content. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FIFA aligns more closely with human judgment than existing evaluation
methods, and that Post-Correction effectively improves factual consistency in
both text and video generation.

### [3] [SPARC: Concept-Aligned Sparse Autoencoders for Cross-Model and Cross-Modal Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06265)
*Ali Nasiri-Sarvi,Hassan Rivaz,Mahdi S. Hosseini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPARC提出了一种统一的多模型潜在空间对齐框架，通过全局稀疏性和跨重建损失实现概念对齐，显著提升了跨模型解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不同AI模型因独立表示导致的高层概念编码不一致问题，提升跨模型解释性。

Method: 采用全局TopK稀疏机制和跨重建损失，学习共享的稀疏潜在空间。

Result: 在Open Images上，SPARC的Jaccard相似度达到0.80，比之前方法提升三倍以上。

Conclusion: SPARC实现了跨模型和跨模态的概念对齐，支持直接比较和实际应用。

Abstract: Understanding how different AI models encode the same high-level concepts,
such as objects or attributes, remains challenging because each model typically
produces its own isolated representation. Existing interpretability methods
like Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each
model, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model
interpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for
Aligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,
unified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,
vision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is
enforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,
ensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given
concept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages
semantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically
improves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than
tripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared
sparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar
high-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of
how different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring
manual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned
representation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided
spatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal
retrieval. Code and models are available at

### [4] [A Probabilistic Approach to Uncertainty Quantification Leveraging 3D Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06269)
*Rushil Desai,Frederik Warburg,Trevor Darrell,Marissa Ramirez de Chanlatte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BayesSDF提出了一种新的概率框架，用于量化神经隐式SDF模型中的不确定性，解决了现有方法在几何一致性和校准方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学模拟应用（如森林中的流体模拟）需要精确的表面几何和对不确定性的了解，现有方法缺乏直接几何集成，导致不确定性图校准不佳。

Method: BayesSDF利用拉普拉斯近似，通过基于Hessian的指标量化局部表面不稳定性，实现高效计算和表面感知的不确定性估计。

Result: 实验表明，BayesSDF在合成和真实数据集上优于现有方法，提供了与重建几何紧密对应的不确定性预测。

Conclusion: BayesSDF为不确定性感知的3D场景重建、模拟和机器人决策奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in neural implicit 3D representations, particularly
those utilizing Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), remains a substantial
challenge due to computational inefficiencies, scalability issues, and
geometric inconsistencies. Existing methods typically neglect direct geometric
integration, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty maps. We introduce
BayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification in
neural implicit SDF models, motivated by scientific simulation applications
with 3D environments (e.g., forests) such as modeling fluid flow through
forests, where precise surface geometry and awareness of fidelity surface
geometric uncertainty are essential. Unlike radiance-based models such as NeRF
or 3D Gaussian splatting, which lack explicit surface formulations, SDFs define
continuous and differentiable geometry, making them better suited for physical
modeling and analysis. BayesSDF leverages a Laplace approximation to quantify
local surface instability via Hessian-based metrics, enabling computationally
efficient, surface-aware uncertainty estimation. Our method shows that
uncertainty predictions correspond closely with poorly reconstructed geometry,
providing actionable confidence measures for downstream use. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BayesSDF
outperforms existing methods in both calibration and geometric consistency,
establishing a strong foundation for uncertainty-aware 3D scene reconstruction,
simulation, and robotic decision-making.

### [5] [LIRA: Inferring Segmentation in Large Multi-modal Models with Local Interleaved Region Assistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06272)
*Zhang Li,Biao Yang,Qiang Liu,Shuo Zhang,Zhiyin Ma,Shuo Zhang,Liang Yin,Linger Deng,Yabo Sun,Yuliang Liu,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LIRA框架通过结合语义增强特征提取器和交错局部视觉耦合，解决了多模态模型在分割和理解中的不准确和幻觉问题，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型在分割和理解任务中存在不准确和幻觉问题，主要源于视觉理解能力不足和缺乏细粒度感知。

Method: LIRA框架包含两个关键组件：语义增强特征提取器（SEFE）和交错局部视觉耦合（ILVC），分别提升分割准确性和减少幻觉。

Result: LIRA在分割和理解任务中达到最先进性能，并通过AttrEval数据集量化了语义推断能力。

Conclusion: LIRA通过结合视觉理解和分割的互补关系，有效解决了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: While large multi-modal models (LMMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in
segmentation and comprehension, they still struggle with two limitations:
inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension. These challenges stem
primarily from constraints in weak visual comprehension and a lack of
fine-grained perception. To alleviate these limitations, we propose LIRA, a
framework that capitalizes on the complementary relationship between visual
comprehension and segmentation via two key components: (1) Semantic-Enhanced
Feature Extractor (SEFE) improves object attribute inference by fusing semantic
and pixel-level features, leading to more accurate segmentation; (2)
Interleaved Local Visual Coupling (ILVC) autoregressively generates local
descriptions after extracting local features based on segmentation masks,
offering fine-grained supervision to mitigate hallucinations. Furthermore, we
find that the precision of object segmentation is positively correlated with
the latent related semantics of the <seg> token. To quantify this relationship
and the model's potential semantic inferring ability, we introduce the
Attributes Evaluation (AttrEval) dataset. Our experiments show that LIRA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and comprehension
tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/echo840/LIRA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线HTR系统在历史文档数字化等领域至关重要，但标注数据稀缺，尤其是低资源语言和复杂脚本，限制了其性能。

Method: 采用PRISMA方法，系统筛选了1,302篇研究，最终纳入848篇，评估了传统和深度学习方法。

Result: 分析了现有数据集、评估指标和先进方法，揭示了研究空白。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向，以推动手写文本生成在多语言和多风格领域的发展。

Abstract: Offline Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems play a crucial role in
applications such as historical document digitization, automatic form
processing, and biometric authentication. However, their performance is often
hindered by the limited availability of annotated training data, particularly
for low-resource languages and complex scripts. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of offline handwritten data augmentation and generation
techniques designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of HTR systems. We
systematically examine traditional augmentation methods alongside recent
advances in deep learning, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
diffusion models, and transformer-based approaches. Furthermore, we explore the
challenges associated with generating diverse and realistic handwriting
samples, particularly in preserving script authenticity and addressing data
scarcity. This survey follows the PRISMA methodology, ensuring a structured and
rigorous selection process. Our analysis began with 1,302 primary studies,
which were filtered down to 848 after removing duplicates, drawing from key
academic sources such as IEEE Digital Library, Springer Link, Science Direct,
and ACM Digital Library. By evaluating existing datasets, assessment metrics,
and state-of-the-art methodologies, this survey identifies key research gaps
and proposes future directions to advance the field of handwritten text
generation across diverse linguistic and stylistic landscapes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CCPDA的数据增强方法，用于提升野火分割模型的性能，特别关注火类分割效果。该方法通过集中复制粘贴火簇来增加数据集多样性，实验证明其优于其他增强方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在野火科学领域，获取和标注用于训练分割模型的图像成本高昂且公开数据集稀缺。为了解决这一问题，论文提出了CCPDA方法。

Method: CCPDA包括三个步骤：(i)识别源图像中的火簇，(ii)通过集中技术聚焦火区核心，(iii)将精炼的火簇粘贴到目标图像上。

Result: 实验表明，CCPDA显著提升了火类分割性能，优于其他数据增强方法。

Conclusion: CCPDA有效缓解了小型标注数据集的训练难题，尤其在火类分割任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Collecting and annotating images for the purpose of training segmentation
models is often cost prohibitive. In the domain of wildland fire science, this
challenge is further compounded by the scarcity of reliable public datasets
with labeled ground truth. This paper presents the Centralized Copy-Paste Data
Augmentation (CCPDA) method, for the purpose of assisting with the training of
deep-learning multiclass segmentation models, with special focus on improving
segmentation outcomes for the fire-class. CCPDA has three main steps: (i)
identify fire clusters in the source image, (ii) apply a centralization
technique to focus on the core of the fire area, and (iii) paste the refined
fire clusters onto a target image. This method increases dataset diversity
while preserving the essential characteristics of the fire class. The
effectiveness of this augmentation technique is demonstrated via numerical
analysis and comparison against various other augmentation methods using a
weighted sum-based multi-objective optimization approach. This approach helps
elevate segmentation performance metrics specific to the fire class, which
carries significantly more operational significance than other classes (fuel,
ash, or background). Numerical performance assessment validates the efficacy of
the presented CCPDA method in alleviating the difficulties associated with
small, manually labeled training datasets. It also illustrates that CCPDA
outperforms other augmentation strategies in the application scenario
considered, particularly in improving fire-class segmentation performance.

*Fuyuan Zhang,Qichen Wang,Jianjun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AR2（Attention-Guided Repair for Robustness）是一种通过对齐干净和损坏图像的类激活图（CAMs）来增强预训练CNN鲁棒性的方法，无需改变架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在常见损坏（如噪声、模糊、天气和数字失真）下性能显著下降，限制了其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: AR2通过迭代修复策略，交替进行CAM引导的细化和标准微调，以保持输入扰动下的一致性注意力。

Result: AR2在标准损坏基准测试（CIFAR-10-C、CIFAR-100-C和ImageNet-C）上优于现有方法，平衡了干净数据的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AR2为增强模型在多样化损坏环境中的可靠性提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks suffer from significant performance degradation when
exposed to common corruptions such as noise, blur, weather, and digital
distortions, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. In this
paper, we propose AR2 (Attention-Guided Repair for Robustness), a simple yet
effective method to enhance the corruption robustness of pretrained CNNs. AR2
operates by explicitly aligning the class activation maps (CAMs) between clean
and corrupted images, encouraging the model to maintain consistent attention
even under input perturbations. Our approach follows an iterative repair
strategy that alternates between CAM-guided refinement and standard
fine-tuning, without requiring architectural changes. Extensive experiments
show that AR2 consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
restoring robustness on standard corruption benchmarks (CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C
and ImageNet-C), achieving a favorable balance between accuracy on clean data
and corruption robustness. These results demonstrate that AR2 provides a robust
and scalable solution for enhancing model reliability in real-world
environments with diverse corruptions.

Scale-aware and Unscented Tracker (SU-T), a specialized tracking framework
featuring an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) optimized for non-linear fish
swimming patterns and a novel Fish-Intersection-over-Union (FishIoU) matching
that accounts for the unique morphological characteristics of aquatic species.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SU-T baseline achieves

revealing fundamental differences between fish tracking and terrestrial object
tracking scenarios. MFT25 establishes a robust foundation for advancing
research in underwater tracking systems with important applications in marine
biology, aquaculture monitoring, and ecological conservation. The dataset and

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with wearable sensors is essential for
applications in healthcare, fitness, and human-computer interaction.
Bio-impedance sensing offers unique advantages for fine-grained motion capture
but remains underutilized due to the scarcity of labeled data. We introduce
SImpHAR, a novel framework addressing this limitation through two core
contributions. First, we propose a simulation pipeline that generates realistic
bio-impedance signals from 3D human meshes using shortest-path estimation,
soft-body physics, and text-to-motion generation serving as a digital twin for
data augmentation. Second, we design a two-stage training strategy with
decoupled approach that enables broader activity coverage without requiring
label-aligned synthetic data. We evaluate SImpHAR on our collected ImpAct
dataset and two public benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods, with gains of up to 22.3% and 21.8%, in terms of
accuracy and macro F1 score, respectively. Our results highlight the promise of
simulation-driven augmentation and modular training for impedance-based HAR.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的VLA模型优化框架VOTE，通过无标记器微调和集成投票策略，显著提升性能和泛化能力，同时降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在新对象或环境中泛化能力有限，且附加组件增加了计算负担，因此需要高效的动作预测方法。

Method: 采用无标记器微调方法进行并行动作预测，并结合集成投票策略优化动作采样。

Result: 实验显示，VOTE实现了35倍加速和145Hz吞吐量，性能达到SOTA。

Conclusion: VOTE是一种高效且通用的VLA模型优化框架，显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior
performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However,
their generalization remains limited when applied to novel objects or
unfamiliar environments that lie outside the training distribution. To address
this, many existing approaches integrate additional components such as depth
estimation, segmentation, or even diffusion to improve generalization, at the
cost of adding significant computation overhead, resulting in low efficiency.
This motivates the exploration of efficient action prediction methods, which
are independent of additional high-level visual representations or diffusion
techniques. In this work, we propose VOTE, an efficient and general framework
for the optimization and acceleration of VLA models. In details, we propose a
novel tokenizer-free fine-tuning approach for parallel accurate action
prediction, which reduces computational overhead and accelerates inference
speed. Additionally, we adopt an ensemble voting strategy for the action
sampling, which significantly improves model performance and enhances
generalization. Experimental results show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 35$\times$ faster inference and 145 Hz
throughput. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.

Motivation: 受Transformer和多阶段架构在视频识别和目标检测中的成功启发，探索其在时序动作定位任务中的潜力。

Method: 设计了一个多阶段Transformer架构PCL-Former，包含Proposal-Former、Classification-Former和Localization-Former三个模块，每个模块有专用损失函数。

Result: 在THUMOS14、ActivityNet-1.3和HACS数据集上分别优于现有方法2.8%、1.2%和4.8%。

Conclusion: PCL-Former通过模块化设计有效提升了时序动作定位的性能，验证了多阶段Transformer架构的潜力。

Abstract: Inspired by the recent success of transformers and multi-stage architectures
in video recognition and object detection domains. We thoroughly explore the
rich spatio-temporal properties of transformers within a multi-stage
architecture paradigm for the temporal action localization (TAL) task. This
exploration led to the development of a hierarchical multi-stage transformer
architecture called PCL-Former, where each subtask is handled by a dedicated
transformer module with a specialized loss function. Specifically, the
Proposal-Former identifies candidate segments in an untrimmed video that may
contain actions, the Classification-Former classifies the action categories
within those segments, and the Localization-Former precisely predicts the
temporal boundaries (i.e., start and end) of the action instances. To evaluate
the performance of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on three
challenging benchmark datasets: THUMOS-14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS Segments.
We also conducted detailed ablation experiments to assess the impact of each
individual module of our PCL-Former. The obtained quantitative results validate
the effectiveness of the proposed PCL-Former, outperforming state-of-the-art
TAL approaches by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 4.8% on THUMOS14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS
datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: THOR是一种实时自适应时空RGB帧采样方法，利用热传感捕捉手部活动，显著减少数据量和功耗，同时保持高识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可穿戴相机连续处理RGB图像时的高功耗、大数据量、隐私问题和计算资源需求。

Method: 结合低分辨率热感数据动态调整RGB帧采样率，并利用热信号定位感兴趣区域（手部活动），仅处理必要图像部分。

Result: 仅使用3%的原始RGB数据，实现95%的手部活动识别F1分数，与完整视频（94%）相当。

Conclusion: THOR为实时监测手部活动和健康风险行为提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Wearable cameras are increasingly used as an observational and interventional
tool for human behaviors by providing detailed visual data of hand-related
activities. This data can be leveraged to facilitate memory recall for logging
of behavior or timely interventions aimed at improving health. However,
continuous processing of RGB images from these cameras consumes significant
power impacting battery lifetime, generates a large volume of unnecessary video
data for post-processing, raises privacy concerns, and requires substantial
computational resources for real-time analysis. We introduce THOR, a real-time
adaptive spatio-temporal RGB frame sampling method that leverages thermal
sensing to capture hand-object patches and classify them in real-time. We use
low-resolution thermal camera data to identify moments when a person switches
from one hand-related activity to another, and adjust the RGB frame sampling
rate by increasing it during activity transitions and reducing it during
periods of sustained activity. Additionally, we use the thermal cues from the
hand to localize the region of interest (i.e., the hand-object interaction) in
each RGB frame, allowing the system to crop and process only the necessary part
of the image for activity recognition. We develop a wearable device to validate
our method through an in-the-wild study with 14 participants and over 30
activities, and further evaluate it on Ego4D (923 participants across 9
countries, totaling 3,670 hours of video). Our results show that using only 3%
of the original RGB video data, our method captures all the activity segments,
and achieves hand-related activity recognition F1-score (95%) comparable to
using the entire RGB video (94%). Our work provides a more practical path for
the longitudinal use of wearable cameras to monitor hand-related activities and
health-risk behaviors in real time.

TL;DR: 提出了一种事件自动编码器架构，用于高效压缩和重建事件数据，提升实时边缘计算中的对象检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统帧式视觉系统在高动态环境中存在运动模糊、高延迟和数据冗余问题，事件相机虽能解决这些问题，但其稀疏和噪声事件流对对象检测提出挑战。

Method: 采用卷积编码的事件自动编码器架构，结合自适应阈值选择和轻量级分类器，以减少计算复杂度并提高识别精度。

Result: 在SEFD数据集上，模型精度与YOLO-v4相当，但参数减少35.5倍；嵌入式平台上帧率可达8-44.8 FPS，比现有技术快87.84倍。

Conclusion: 该模型显著提升了事件相机的视觉性能，适用于低功耗、高速的实时边缘计算应用。

Abstract: High-speed vision sensing is essential for real-time perception in
applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.
Traditional frame-based vision systems suffer from motion blur, high latency,
and redundant data processing, limiting their performance in dynamic
environments. Event cameras, which capture asynchronous brightness changes at
the pixel level, offer a promising alternative but pose challenges in object
detection due to sparse and noisy event streams. To address this, we propose an
event autoencoder architecture that efficiently compresses and reconstructs
event data while preserving critical spatial and temporal features. The
proposed model employs convolutional encoding and incorporates adaptive
threshold selection and a lightweight classifier to enhance recognition
accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the
existing Smart Event Face Dataset (SEFD) demonstrate that our approach achieves
comparable accuracy to the YOLO-v4 model while utilizing up to $35.5\times$
fewer parameters. Implementations on embedded platforms, including Raspberry Pi
4B and NVIDIA Jetson Nano, show high frame rates ranging from 8 FPS up to 44.8

TL;DR: Video-RTS通过结合数据高效的强化学习和视频自适应测试时间缩放策略，显著提升了视频推理能力的数据效率，无需资源密集的监督微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习和大型语言模型的视频推理方法依赖大规模监督微调和长链思维标注，成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 跳过监督微调，采用纯强化学习训练和基于输出的一致性奖励，并引入稀疏到密集的视频测试时间缩放策略。

Result: 在多个视频推理基准测试中，Video-RTS仅用3.6%的训练样本就平均提升了2.4%的准确率，在Video-Holmes和MMVU上分别提升了4.2%和2.6%。

Conclusion: Video-RTS通过纯强化学习和自适应视频测试时间缩放的互补优势，实现了强大的推理性能。

Abstract: Despite advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based video reasoning with
large language models (LLMs), data collection and finetuning remain significant
challenges. These methods often rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations,
making them costly and hard to scale. To address this, we present Video-RTS, a
new approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved
data efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time
scaling (TTS) strategy. Based on observations about the data scaling of RL
samples, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL
training with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or
extensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more
efficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves
inference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate
our approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS
surpasses existing video reasoning models by an average of 2.4% in accuracy
using only 3.6% training samples. For example, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2%
improvement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning
benchmark, and a 2.6% improvement on MMVU. Notably, our pure RL training and
adaptive video TTS offer complementary strengths, enabling Video-RTS's strong
reasoning performance.

*Yuechen Xie,Haobo Jiang,Jin Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Mask6D的新预训练策略，通过结合2D-3D对应图和可见掩码图，提升单目RGB图像在遮挡或杂乱场景中的6D物体姿态估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前姿态估计网络在2D特征提取上表现不佳，尤其是在目标被遮挡或场景杂乱时，RGB信息有限。

Method: 引入2D-3D对应图和可见掩码图作为额外模态信息，设计基于重建的预训练模型和对象聚焦的损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有的端到端姿态估计方法。

Conclusion: Mask6D通过预训练策略有效提升了姿态估计的鲁棒性，尤其在复杂场景中。

Abstract: Robust 6D object pose estimation in cluttered or occluded conditions using
monocular RGB images remains a challenging task. One reason is that current
pose estimation networks struggle to extract discriminative, pose-aware
features using 2D feature backbones, especially when the available RGB
information is limited due to target occlusion in cluttered scenes. To mitigate
this, we propose a novel pose estimation-specific pre-training strategy named
Mask6D. Our approach incorporates pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence maps and
visible mask maps as additional modal information, which is combined with RGB
images for the reconstruction-based model pre-training. Essentially, this 2D-3D
correspondence maps a transformed 3D object model to 2D pixels, reflecting the
pose information of the target in camera coordinate system. Meanwhile, the
integrated visible mask map can effectively guide our model to disregard
cluttered background information. In addition, an object-focused pre-training
loss function is designed to further facilitate our network to remove the
background interference. Finally, we fine-tune our pre-trained pose prior-aware
network via conventional pose training strategy to realize the reliable pose
prediction. Extensive experiments verify that our method outperforms previous
end-to-end pose estimation methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BC-HOI的双边协作框架，用于开放词汇HOI检测，通过注意力偏差引导和LLM监督指导提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖视觉语言模型（VLM）生成的特征，但这些特征过于粗粒度，与检测任务需求不符。

Method: BC-HOI框架包含注意力偏差引导（ABG）和基于LLM的监督指导（LSG），分别优化VLM和HOI检测器的交互。

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO基准测试中表现优异，尤其在开放词汇和封闭设置下。

Conclusion: BC-HOI通过双边协作有效解决了开放词汇HOI检测中的细粒度特征问题。

Abstract: Open vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a challenging
task that detects all <human, verb, object> triplets of interest in an image,
even those that are not pre-defined in the training set. Existing approaches
typically rely on output features generated by large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to enhance the generalization ability of interaction representations.
However, the visual features produced by VLMs are holistic and coarse-grained,
which contradicts the nature of detection tasks. To address this issue, we
propose a novel Bilateral Collaboration framework for open vocabulary HOI
detection (BC-HOI). This framework includes an Attention Bias Guidance (ABG)
component, which guides the VLM to produce fine-grained instance-level
interaction features according to the attention bias provided by the HOI
detector. It also includes a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Supervision
Guidance (LSG) component, which provides fine-grained token-level supervision
for the HOI detector by the LLM component of the VLM. LSG enhances the ability
of ABG to generate high-quality attention bias. We conduct extensive
experiments on two popular benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO, consistently
achieving superior performance in the open vocabulary and closed settings. The
code will be released in Github.

Abstract: Advances in vision-based sensors and computer vision algorithms have
significantly improved the analysis and understanding of traffic scenarios. To
facilitate the use of these improvements for road safety, this survey
systematically categorizes the critical elements that demand attention in
traffic scenarios and comprehensively analyzes available vision-driven tasks
and datasets. Compared to existing surveys that focus on isolated domains, our
taxonomy categorizes attention-worthy traffic entities into two main groups
that are anomalies and normal but critical entities, integrating ten categories
and twenty subclasses. It establishes connections between inherently related
fields and provides a unified analytical framework. Our survey highlights the
analysis of 35 vision-driven tasks and comprehensive examinations and
visualizations of 73 available datasets based on the proposed taxonomy. The
cross-domain investigation covers the pros and cons of each benchmark with the
aim of providing information on standards unification and resource
optimization. Our article concludes with a systematic discussion of the
existing weaknesses, underlining the potential effects and promising solutions
from various perspectives. The integrated taxonomy, comprehensive analysis, and
recapitulatory tables serve as valuable contributions to this rapidly evolving
field by providing researchers with a holistic overview, guiding strategic
resource selection, and highlighting critical research gaps.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的概念遗忘方法在平衡遗忘效果与生成能力方面存在不足，导致扩散模型的安全风险难以有效解决。

Method: KSCU方法利用扩散模型的逐步采样特性，专注于对最终结果影响最大的关键步骤，仅在这些步骤上微调模型。

Result: 实验表明，KSCU能有效阻止T2I扩散模型生成不良图像，同时更好地保留模型的生成能力。

Conclusion: KSCU通过针对性步骤优化，实现了更高效的概念遗忘与生成能力保留，为扩散模型的安全应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs), represented by Stable Diffusion,
which generate highly realistic images based on textual input, have been widely
used. However, their misuse poses serious security risks. While existing
concept unlearning methods aim to mitigate these risks, they struggle to
balance unlearning effectiveness with generative retainability.To overcome this
limitation, we innovatively propose the Key Step Concept Unlearning (KSCU)
method, which ingeniously capitalizes on the unique stepwise sampling
characteristic inherent in diffusion models during the image generation
process. Unlike conventional approaches that treat all denoising steps equally,
KSCU strategically focuses on pivotal steps with the most influence over the
final outcome by dividing key steps for different concept unlearning tasks and
fine-tuning the model only at those steps. This targeted approach reduces the
number of parameter updates needed for effective unlearning, while maximizing
the retention of the model's generative capabilities.Through extensive
benchmark experiments, we demonstrate that KSCU effectively prevents T2I DMs
from generating undesirable images while better retaining the model's
generative capabilities.Our code will be released.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种完整的流程，将英语语音转换为流畅的3D手语动画，结合语音识别、机器翻译和动作生成技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帮助聋人和听力障碍者更轻松地沟通，填补了从英语语音到手语动画转换的研究空白。

Method: 使用Whisper将语音转为文本，MarianMT模型翻译为ASL gloss，结合Word2Vec和FastText优化翻译，最后通过3D关键点系统生成动画。

Result: 系统在BLEU评分上表现优异（0.7714和0.8923），并创建了新的数据集Sign3D-WLASL和BookGlossCorpus-CG。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个从语音到3D手语动画的完整框架，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Helping deaf and hard-of-hearing people communicate more easily is the main
goal of Automatic Sign Language Translation. Although most past research has
focused on turning sign language into text, doing the reverse, turning spoken
English into sign language animations, has been largely overlooked. That's
because it involves multiple steps, such as understanding speech, translating
it into sign-friendly grammar, and generating natural human motion. In this
work, we introduce a complete pipeline that converts English speech into
smooth, realistic 3D sign language animations. Our system starts with Whisper
to translate spoken English into text. Then, we use a MarianMT machine
translation model to translate that text into American Sign Language (ASL)
gloss, a simplified version of sign language that captures meaning without
grammar. This model performs well, reaching BLEU scores of 0.7714 and 0.8923.
To make the gloss translation more accurate, we also use word embeddings such
as Word2Vec and FastText to understand word meanings. Finally, we animate the
translated gloss using a 3D keypoint-based motion system trained on
Sign3D-WLASL, a dataset we created by extracting body, hand, and face key
points from real ASL videos in the WLASL dataset. To support the gloss
translation stage, we also built a new dataset called BookGlossCorpus-CG, which
turns everyday English sentences from the BookCorpus dataset into ASL gloss
using grammar rules. Our system stitches everything together by smoothly
interpolating between signs to create natural, continuous animations. Unlike
previous works like How2Sign and Phoenix-2014T that focus on recognition or use
only one type of data, our pipeline brings together audio, text, and motion in
a single framework that goes all the way from spoken English to lifelike 3D
sign language animation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类驾驶行为的启发，旨在解决现有方法在时空协调和动态适应性上的不足。

Method: 采用逆向学习注意力机制（IL Attention）动态编码交互时空协调，并提出动态锚点选择模块（DAS）提取关键点。

Result: 在INTERACTION和Argoverse数据集上达到最优性能，尤其在复杂交互场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: ILNet通过动态建模和高效参数利用，显著提升了轨迹预测的准确性和多模态分布能力。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for multi-agent interaction scenarios is a crucial
challenge. Most advanced methods model agent interactions by efficiently
factorized attention based on the temporal and agent axes. However, this static
and foward modeling lacks explicit interactive spatio-temporal coordination,
capturing only obvious and immediate behavioral intentions. Alternatively, the
modern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a
fixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different
future environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust
initial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of
surrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes
ILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL)
attention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module. IL Attention employs an
inverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments,
introducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal
coordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture
complex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to
extract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost
no increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion
forecasting datasets. Particularly, in challenged interaction scenarios, ILNet
achieves higher accuracy and more multimodal distributions of trajectories over
fewer parameters. Our codes are available at https://github.com/mjZeng11/ILNet.

Motivation: 野生动物相机陷阱数据量大，标注和模型训练成本高，现有主动学习方法需要完全访问模型，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出了一种结合对象和图像层面的不确定性和多样性的主动学习样本选择方法。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用30%的精选训练数据，动物检测器的性能可达到或超过使用完整数据集的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法为野生动物监测和保护提供了高效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Smart data selection is becoming increasingly important in data-driven
machine learning. Active learning offers a promising solution by allowing
machine learning models to be effectively trained with optimal data including
the most informative samples from large datasets. Wildlife data captured by
camera traps are excessive in volume, requiring tremendous effort in data
labelling and animal detection models training. Therefore, applying active
learning to optimise the amount of labelled data would be a great aid in
enabling automated wildlife monitoring and conservation. However, existing
active learning techniques require that a machine learning model (i.e., an
object detector) be fully accessible, limiting the applicability of the
techniques. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic active learning approach
for detection of animals captured by camera traps. Our approach integrates
uncertainty and diversity quantities of samples at both the object-based and
image-based levels into the active learning sample selection process. We
validate our approach in a benchmark animal dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that, using only 30% of the training data selected by our approach,
a state-of-the-art animal detector can achieve a performance of equal or
greater than that with the use of the complete training dataset.

Conclusion: MK-Pose通过多模态融合和图增强设计，有效提升了类别级物体姿态估计的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation, which predicts the pose of objects
within a known category without prior knowledge of individual instances, is
essential in applications like warehouse automation and manufacturing. Existing
methods relying on RGB images or point cloud data often struggle with object
occlusion and generalization across different instances and categories. This
paper proposes a multimodal-based keypoint learning framework (MK-Pose) that
integrates RGB images, point clouds, and category-level textual descriptions.
The model uses a self-supervised keypoint detection module enhanced with
attention-based query generation, soft heatmap matching and graph-based
relational modeling. Additionally, a graph-enhanced feature fusion module is
designed to integrate local geometric information and global context. MK-Pose
is evaluated on CAMERA25 and REAL275 dataset, and is further tested for
cross-dataset capability on HouseCat6D dataset. The results demonstrate that
MK-Pose outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both IoU and average
precision without shape priors. Codes will be released at

Conclusion: ToBo能有效学习动态场景的表示，并具有跨模型规模的扩展性。

Abstract: Deriving compact and temporally aware visual representations from dynamic
scenes is essential for successful execution of sequential scene understanding
tasks such as visual tracking and robotic manipulation. In this paper, we
introduce Token Bottleneck (ToBo), a simple yet intuitive self-supervised
learning pipeline that squeezes a scene into a bottleneck token and predicts
the subsequent scene using minimal patches as hints. The ToBo pipeline
facilitates the learning of sequential scene representations by conservatively
encoding the reference scene into a compact bottleneck token during the squeeze
step. In the expansion step, we guide the model to capture temporal dynamics by
predicting the target scene using the bottleneck token along with few target
patches as hints. This design encourages the vision backbone to embed temporal
dependencies, thereby enabling understanding of dynamic transitions across
scenes. Extensive experiments in diverse sequential tasks, including video
label propagation and robot manipulation in simulated environments demonstrate
the superiority of ToBo over baselines. Moreover, deploying our pre-trained
model on physical robots confirms its robustness and effectiveness in
real-world environments. We further validate the scalability of ToBo across
different model scales.

Conclusion: Concept-TRAK为生成式AI的负责任开发和治理提供了可操作的见解，解决了概念级归因的需求。

Abstract: While diffusion models excel at image generation, their growing adoption
raises critical concerns around copyright issues and model transparency.
Existing attribution methods identify training examples influencing an entire
image, but fall short in isolating contributions to specific elements, such as
styles or objects, that matter most to stakeholders. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \emph{concept-level attribution} via a novel method called
\emph{Concept-TRAK}. Concept-TRAK extends influence functions with two key
innovations: (1) a reformulated diffusion training loss based on diffusion
posterior sampling, enabling robust, sample-specific attribution; and (2) a
concept-aware reward function that emphasizes semantic relevance. We evaluate
Concept-TRAK on the AbC benchmark, showing substantial improvements over prior
methods. Through diverse case studies--ranging from identifying IP-protected
and unsafe content to analyzing prompt engineering and compositional
learning--we demonstrate how concept-level attribution yields actionable
insights for responsible generative AI development and governance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在语言查询中处理空间关系（如“椅子上的书”）时表现不佳，主要因为对语言和3D场景中空间关系的推理不足。

Method: SpatialReasoner通过微调LLM捕捉空间关系，并构建视觉属性增强的层次特征场，结合CLIP特征和SAM提取的掩码。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能无缝集成不同神经表示，显著优于基线模型，并增强其空间推理能力。

Conclusion: SpatialReasoner通过结合语言和视觉属性，有效解决了3D视觉定位中的空间关系推理问题。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on
free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such
as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language
fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D
scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target
objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods
struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language
queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from
inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D
scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural
representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial
reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature
field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in
language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial
relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial
relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner
incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical
feature field. This field represents language and instance features using
distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a
hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial
relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework
can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations,
outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their
spatial reasoning capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要捕捉成对关系，未能建模多视图的联合结构。

Method: 提出DSF，将多视图表示为分布并测量分布间的散度。

Result: DSF在kNN分类和线性评估等任务中表现优异，且效率更高。

Conclusion: DSF无需温度超参数即可有效工作，且与余弦相似性有理论联系。

Abstract: Recent success in contrastive learning has sparked growing interest in more
effectively leveraging multiple augmented views of an instance. While prior
methods incorporate multiple views at the loss or feature level, they primarily
capture pairwise relationships and fail to model the joint structure across all
views. In this work, we propose a divergence-based similarity function (DSF)
that explicitly captures the joint structure by representing each set of
augmented views as a distribution and measuring similarity as the divergence
between distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSF consistently
improves performance across various tasks, including kNN classification and
linear evaluation, while also offering greater efficiency compared to other
multi-view methods. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical connection between
DSF and cosine similarity, and show that, unlike cosine similarity, DSF
operates effectively without requiring a temperature hyperparameter.

Abstract: Panoramic perception holds significant potential for autonomous driving,
enabling vehicles to acquire a comprehensive 360{\deg} surround view in a
single shot. However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete
panoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation
pipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing
street view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration
capabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing
datasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In
this paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for
autonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data
with control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on
two key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the
inherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose
the Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama
generation as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps
between different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable
generation of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method
(PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling
controllable panoramic image generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
generated images from three perspectives: image quality assessment (i.e.,
no-reference and with reference), controllability, and their utility in
real-world Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation. Notably, the generated data
consistently outperforms the original stitched images in no-reference quality
metrics and enhances downstream perception models. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/Bryant-Teng/Percep360.

### [30] [Edge-Boundary-Texture Loss: A Tri-Class Generalization of Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy for Enhanced Edge Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06569)
*Hao Shu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的损失函数EBT，通过将像素分为边缘、边界和纹理三类，改进了传统WBCE损失在边缘检测中的模糊预测问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统WBCE损失对非边缘像素处理过于简单，忽略了结构细节，导致预测模糊。

Method: 提出EBT损失，将像素分为边缘、边界和纹理三类，并为每类分配不同的监督权重。

Result: 实验证明EBT损失在多个基准测试中表现优异，且超参数设置简单。

Conclusion: EBT损失优于传统方法，易于部署且鲁棒性强。

Abstract: Edge detection (ED) remains a fundamental task in computer vision, yet its
performance is often hindered by the ambiguous nature of non-edge pixels near
object boundaries. The widely adopted Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (WBCE) loss
treats all non-edge pixels uniformly, overlooking the structural nuances around
edges and often resulting in blurred predictions. In this paper, we propose the
Edge-Boundary-Texture (EBT) loss, a novel objective that explicitly divides
pixels into three categories, edge, boundary, and texture, and assigns each a
distinct supervisory weight. This tri-class formulation enables more structured
learning by guiding the model to focus on both edge precision and contextual
boundary localization. We theoretically show that the EBT loss generalizes the
WBCE loss, with the latter becoming a limit case. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the EBT loss both
quantitatively and perceptually. Furthermore, the consistent use of unified
hyperparameters across all models and datasets, along with robustness to their
moderate variations, indicates that the EBT loss requires minimal fine-tuning
and is easily deployable in practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EXAONE Path 2.0提出了一种基于slide-level监督的病理学基础模型，解决了patch-level自监督学习在生物标志物预测中的局限性，仅需37k WSIs即可在10项任务中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统patch-level自监督学习（SSL）在生物标志物预测中可能忽略复杂领域特征，且数据效率低。

Method: 通过slide-level监督学习patch-level表征，构建EXAONE Path 2.0模型。

Result: 仅用37k WSIs训练，在10项生物标志物预测任务中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: EXAONE Path 2.0显著提高了数据效率和性能，解决了SSL的局限性。

Abstract: In digital pathology, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often difficult to handle
due to their gigapixel scale, so most approaches train patch encoders via
self-supervised learning (SSL) and then aggregate the patch-level embeddings
via multiple instance learning (MIL) or slide encoders for downstream tasks.
However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are
essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular
characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for
natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain
less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive
computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To
address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation
model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level
supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves
state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks,
demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.

TL;DR: MOST是一种新型运动扩散模型，通过时间片段Banzhaf交互解决从罕见语言提示生成人类运动的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在粗粒度匹配和忽略语义线索方面存在不足，MOST旨在通过细粒度片段关系解决这些问题。

Method: 提出时间片段Banzhaf交互量化文本-运动一致性，并利用检索的运动片段生成语义一致的运动。

Result: MOST在文本到运动的检索和生成性能上达到最先进水平，尤其在罕见提示上表现突出。

Conclusion: MOST通过细粒度匹配和消除冗余，显著提升了文本到运动生成的效果。

Abstract: We introduce MOST, a novel motion diffusion model via temporal clip Banzhaf
interaction, aimed at addressing the persistent challenge of generating human
motion from rare language prompts. While previous approaches struggle with
coarse-grained matching and overlook important semantic cues due to motion
redundancy, our key insight lies in leveraging fine-grained clip relationships
to mitigate these issues. MOST's retrieval stage presents the first formulation
of its kind - temporal clip Banzhaf interaction - which precisely quantifies
textual-motion coherence at the clip level. This facilitates direct,
fine-grained text-to-motion clip matching and eliminates prevalent redundancy.
In the generation stage, a motion prompt module effectively utilizes retrieved
motion clips to produce semantically consistent movements. Extensive
evaluations confirm that MOST achieves state-of-the-art text-to-motion
retrieval and generation performance by comprehensively addressing previous
challenges, as demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative results
highlighting its effectiveness, especially for rare prompts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CDR-CA的新任务，通过多源DPP方法优化多属性的多样性，以适应不同应用场景的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅关注图像外观的多样性指标，但其理想值因应用场景而异，限制了结果多样化技术的应用范围。

Method: 提出Multi-Source DPPs，扩展了DPP到多源场景，并通过流形表示的统一相似性矩阵建模，引入Tangent Normalization以反映上下文。

Result: 大量实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CDR-CA任务及Multi-Source DPPs方法在优化多属性多样性方面表现出色，适应性强。

Abstract: Result diversification (RD) is a crucial technique in Text-to-Image Retrieval
for enhancing the efficiency of a practical application. Conventional methods
focus solely on increasing the diversity metric of image appearances. However,
the diversity metric and its desired value vary depending on the application,
which limits the applications of RD. This paper proposes a novel task called
CDR-CA (Contextual Diversity Refinement of Composite Attributes). CDR-CA aims
to refine the diversities of multiple attributes, according to the
application's context. To address this task, we propose Multi-Source DPPs, a
simple yet strong baseline that extends the Determinantal Point Process (DPP)
to multi-sources. We model MS-DPP as a single DPP model with a unified
similarity matrix based on a manifold representation. We also introduce Tangent
Normalization to reflect contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应边距对比学习方法（AMContrast3D和AMContrast3D++），用于点云的3D语义分割，通过动态调整目标函数以处理不同模糊度的点，从而提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常对所有点采用相同的惩罚目标，忽略了过渡区域中点的模糊性和特征区分度不足的问题，导致模型性能受限。

Method: 设计了AMContrast3D，将对比学习融入模糊度估计框架，根据点的模糊度动态调整目标；进一步提出AMContrast3D++，通过并行训练分支和模糊预测模块优化嵌入表示。

Result: 在S3DIS和ScanNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了分割性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过自适应处理模糊点，该方法在3D语义分割任务中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive margin contrastive learning method for 3D
semantic segmentation on point clouds. Most existing methods use equally
penalized objectives, which ignore the per-point ambiguities and less
discriminated features stemming from transition regions. However, as highly
ambiguous points may be indistinguishable even for humans, their manually
annotated labels are less reliable, and hard constraints over these points
would lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, we first design
AMContrast3D, a method comprising contrastive learning into an ambiguity
estimation framework, tailored to adaptive objectives for individual points
based on ambiguity levels. As a result, our method promotes model training,
which ensures the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes
for high-ambiguity points. As ambiguities are formulated based on position
discrepancies across labels, optimization during inference is constrained by
the assumption that all unlabeled points are uniformly unambiguous, lacking
ambiguity awareness. Inspired by the insight of joint training, we further
propose AMContrast3D++ integrating with two branches trained in parallel, where
a novel ambiguity prediction module concurrently learns point ambiguities from
generated embeddings. To this end, we design a masked refinement mechanism that
leverages predicted ambiguities to enable the ambiguous embeddings to be more
reliable, thereby boosting segmentation performance and enhancing robustness.
Experimental results on 3D indoor scene datasets, S3DIS and ScanNet,
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双摄像头系统（DCS）和曝光自适应融合网络（EAFNet）来解决HDR视频重建中的闪烁问题，通过选择性特征融合和多尺度架构实现了高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HDR视频重建中，交替曝光方法导致的曝光波动常引发闪烁问题，需要更稳定的解决方案。

Method: 使用DCS系统分别捕获参考和非参考序列，结合EAFNet进行特征预对齐、非对称交叉特征融合和多尺度重建。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同数据集上实现了最先进的性能，验证了DCS的潜力。

Conclusion: DCS和EAFNet的组合有效解决了HDR视频重建中的闪烁问题，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: In HDR video reconstruction, exposure fluctuations in reference images from
alternating exposure methods often result in flickering. To address this issue,
we propose a dual-camera system (DCS) for HDR video acquisition, where one
camera is assigned to capture consistent reference sequences, while the other
is assigned to capture non-reference sequences for information supplementation.
To tackle the challenges posed by video data, we introduce an exposure-adaptive
fusion network (EAFNet) to achieve more robust results. EAFNet introduced a
pre-alignment subnetwork to explore the influence of exposure, selectively
emphasizing the valuable features across different exposure levels. Then, the
enhanced features are fused by the asymmetric cross-feature fusion subnetwork,
which explores reference-dominated attention maps to improve image fusion by
aligning cross-scale features and performing cross-feature fusion. Finally, the
reconstruction subnetwork adopts a DWT-based multiscale architecture to reduce
ghosting artifacts and refine features at different resolutions. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on different datasets, validating the great
potential of the DCS in HDR video reconstruction. The codes and data captured
by DCS will be available at https://github.com/zqqqyu/DCS.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种跨模态双因果学习（CMDCL）方法，通过结构因果模型解决视频和标签文本之间的因果关系，以提升长期动作识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期动作识别（LTAR）面临时间跨度长、动作关联复杂和视觉干扰等问题，现有方法依赖统计相关性而非因果机制，且缺乏跨模态因果建模。

Method: CMDCL通过文本因果干预解决文本嵌入的跨模态偏差，并通过视觉因果干预去除视觉模态中的干扰因素，实现双因果干预。

Result: 在Charades、Breakfast和COIN三个基准测试中，CMDCL表现出色。

Conclusion: CMDCL通过跨模态双因果学习有效解决了LTAR的挑战，实验证明了其优越性。

Abstract: Long-term action recognition (LTAR) is challenging due to extended temporal
spans with complex atomic action correlations and visual confounders. Although
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise, they often rely on
statistical correlations instead of causal mechanisms. Moreover, existing
causality-based methods address modal-specific biases but lack cross-modal
causal modeling, limiting their utility in VLM-based LTAR. This paper proposes
\textbf{C}ross-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{C}ausal \textbf{L}earning
(CMDCL), which introduces a structural causal model to uncover causal
relationships between videos and label texts.
  CMDCL addresses cross-modal biases in text embeddings via textual causal
intervention and removes confounders inherent in the visual modality through
visual causal intervention guided by the debiased text.
  These dual-causal interventions enable robust action representations to
address LTAR challenges. Experimental results on three benchmarks including
Charades, Breakfast and COIN, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
model. Our code is available at https://github.com/xushaowu/CMDCL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高精度工业场景（如半导体制造）中，缺乏专门的基准数据集阻碍了复杂过程建模和预测的研究。

Method: 构建了CHDL数据集，并设计了DIFFUMA模型，结合Mamba模块和扩散模块以捕捉全局时序上下文和增强空间细节。

Result: 在CHDL基准上，DIFFUMA显著优于现有方法，MSE降低39%，SSIM从0.926提升至0.988。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅提供了新的SOTA模型，还为工业AI研究提供了宝贵的数据资源。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video prediction plays a pivotal role in critical domains,
ranging from weather forecasting to industrial automation. However, in
high-precision industrial scenarios such as semiconductor manufacturing, the
absence of specialized benchmark datasets severely hampers research on modeling
and predicting complex processes. To address this challenge, we make a twofold
contribution.First, we construct and release the Chip Dicing Lane Dataset
(CHDL), the first public temporal image dataset dedicated to the semiconductor
wafer dicing process. Captured via an industrial-grade vision system, CHDL
provides a much-needed and challenging benchmark for high-fidelity process
modeling, defect detection, and digital twin development.Second, we propose
DIFFUMA, an innovative dual-path prediction architecture specifically designed
for such fine-grained dynamics. The model captures global long-range temporal
context through a parallel Mamba module, while simultaneously leveraging a
diffusion module, guided by temporal features, to restore and enhance
fine-grained spatial details, effectively combating feature degradation.
Experiments demonstrate that on our CHDL benchmark, DIFFUMA significantly
outperforms existing methods, reducing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 39% and
improving the Structural Similarity (SSIM) from 0.926 to a near-perfect 0.988.
This superior performance also generalizes to natural phenomena datasets. Our
work not only delivers a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) model but, more
importantly, provides the community with an invaluable data resource to drive
future research in industrial AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学高光谱成像（MHSI）在疾病诊断中具有潜力，但高维度和光谱冗余特性使得空间和光谱信息的有效融合具有挑战性。

Method: 设计了跨维度特征融合操作，包括双向注意力机制、光谱引导的空间查询选择和两阶段跨维度解码器。

Result: 在两个显微高光谱图像数据集上的实验表明，该方法在DSC指标上比现有方法提高了5.73%。

Conclusion: Omni-Fuse通过高效的跨维度特征融合，显著提升了高光谱图像的分割性能。

Abstract: Medical Hyperspectral Imaging (MHSI) has emerged as a promising tool for
enhanced disease diagnosis, particularly in computational pathology, offering
rich spectral information that aids in identifying subtle biochemical
properties of tissues. Despite these advantages, effectively fusing both
spatial-dimensional and spectral-dimensional information from MHSIs remains
challenging due to its high dimensionality and spectral redundancy inherent
characteristics. To solve the above challenges, we propose a novel
spatial-spectral omni-fusion network for hyperspectral image segmentation,
named as Omni-Fuse. Here, we introduce abundant cross-dimensional feature
fusion operations, including a cross-dimensional enhancement module that
refines both spatial and spectral features through bidirectional attention
mechanisms, a spectral-guided spatial query selection to select the most
spectral-related spatial feature as the query, and a two-stage
cross-dimensional decoder which dynamically guide the model to focus on the
selected spatial query. Despite of numerous attention blocks, Omni-Fuse remains
efficient in execution. Experiments on two microscopic hyperspectral image
datasets show that our approach can significantly improve the segmentation
performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, with over 5.73 percent
improvement in DSC. Code available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于投影的方法在复杂场景中依赖视点无关投影，限制了点的感知能力和投影多样性，且多投影导致计算冗余。

Method: 设计了VDP框架，通过数据驱动生成投影，结合颜色正则化优化框架，生成高效的单图像输入。

Result: 在S3DIS和ScanNet基准测试中表现出竞争力，计算成本低。

Conclusion: PointVDP提供了一种资源高效的语义理解解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose view-dependent projection (VDP) to facilitate point
cloud segmentation, designing efficient 3D-to-2D mapping that dynamically
adapts to the spatial geometry from view variations. Existing projection-based
methods leverage view-independent projection in complex scenes, relying on
straight lines to generate direct rays or upward curves to reduce occlusions.
However, their view independence provides projection rays that are limited to
pre-defined parameters by human settings, restricting point awareness and
failing to capture sufficient projection diversity across different view
planes. Although multiple projections per view plane are commonly used to
enhance spatial variety, the projected redundancy leads to excessive
computational overhead and inefficiency in image processing. To address these
limitations, we design a framework of VDP to generate data-driven projections
from 3D point distributions, producing highly informative single-image inputs
by predicting rays inspired by the adaptive behavior of fireworks. In addition,
we construct color regularization to optimize the framework, which emphasizes
essential features within semantic pixels and suppresses the non-semantic
features within black pixels, thereby maximizing 2D space utilization in a
projected image. As a result, our approach, PointVDP, develops lightweight
projections in marginal computation costs. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet
benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive results, offering a
resource-efficient solution for semantic understanding.

Conclusion: FOLC-Net为分散式医疗图像分析提供了更可靠、适应性更强的解决方案。

Abstract: The framework is designed to improve performance in the analysis of combined
as well as single anatomical perspectives for MRI disease diagnosis. It
specifically addresses the performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models, particularly when processing axial, coronal, and sagittal
anatomical planes. The paper introduces the FOLC-Net framework, which
incorporates a novel federated-optimized lightweight architecture with
approximately 1.217 million parameters and a storage requirement of only 0.9
MB. FOLC-Net integrates Manta-ray foraging optimization (MRFO) mechanisms for
efficient model structure generation, global model cloning for scalable
training, and ConvNeXt for enhanced client adaptability. The model was
evaluated on combined multi-view data as well as individual views, such as
axial, coronal, and sagittal, to assess its robustness in various medical
imaging scenarios. Moreover, FOLC-Net tests a ShallowFed model on different
data to evaluate its ability to generalize beyond the training dataset. The
results show that FOLC-Net outperforms existing models, particularly in the
challenging sagittal view. For instance, FOLC-Net achieved an accuracy of
92.44% on the sagittal view, significantly higher than the 88.37% accuracy of
study method (DL + Residual Learning) and 88.95% of DL models. Additionally,
FOLC-Net demonstrated improved accuracy across all individual views, providing
a more reliable and robust solution for medical image analysis in decentralized
environments. FOLC-Net addresses the limitations of existing SOTA models by
providing a framework that ensures better adaptability to individual views
while maintaining strong performance in multi-view settings. The incorporation
of MRFO, global model cloning, and ConvNeXt ensures that FOLC-Net performs
better in real-world medical applications.

Result: 通过大量实验验证了方法的有效性，能够准确实现癌变关键点的密集定位。

Conclusion: 该方法在密集标注难以获取的场景中具有潜在的研究价值。

Abstract: Learning from sparse labels is a challenge commonplace in the medical domain.
This is due to numerous factors, such as annotation cost, and is especially
true for newly introduced tasks. When dense pixel-level annotations are needed,
this becomes even more unfeasible. However, being able to learn from just a few
annotations at the pixel-level, while extremely difficult and underutilized,
can drive progress in studies where perfect annotations are not immediately
available. This work tackles the challenge of learning the dense prediction
task of keypoint localization from a few point annotations in the context of 2d
carcinosis keypoint localization from laparoscopic video frames for diagnostic
planning of advanced ovarian cancer patients. To enable this, we formulate the
problem as a sparse heatmap regression from a few point annotations per image
and propose a new loss function, called Crag and Tail loss, for efficient
learning. Our proposed loss function effectively leverages positive sparse
labels while minimizing the impact of false negatives or missed annotations.
Through an extensive ablation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in achieving accurate dense localization of carcinosis keypoints,
highlighting its potential to advance research in scenarios where dense
annotations are challenging to obtain.

Abstract: The visualization of volumetric medical data is crucial for enhancing
diagnostic accuracy and improving surgical planning and education. Cinematic
rendering techniques significantly enrich this process by providing
high-quality visualizations that convey intricate anatomical details, thereby
facilitating better understanding and decision-making in medical contexts.
However, the high computing cost and low rendering speed limit the requirement
of interactive visualization in practical applications. In this paper, we
introduce ClipGS, an innovative Gaussian splatting framework with the clipping
plane supported, for interactive cinematic visualization of volumetric medical
data. To address the challenges posed by dynamic interactions, we propose a
learnable truncation scheme that automatically adjusts the visibility of
Gaussian primitives in response to the clipping plane. Besides, we also design
an adaptive adjustment model to dynamically adjust the deformation of Gaussians
and refine the rendering performance. We validate our method on five volumetric
medical data (including CT and anatomical slice data), and reach an average
36.635 PSNR rendering quality with 156 FPS and 16.1 MB model size,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: 提出的框架和数据集为语音手势视频生成研究提供了高效且公开的资源。

Abstract: Co-speech gesture video generation aims to synthesize realistic,
audio-aligned videos of speakers, complete with synchronized facial expressions
and body gestures. This task presents challenges due to the significant
one-to-many mapping between audio and visual content, further complicated by
the scarcity of large-scale public datasets and high computational demands. We
propose a lightweight framework that utilizes 2D full-body skeletons as an
efficient auxiliary condition to bridge audio signals with visual outputs. Our
approach introduces a diffusion model conditioned on fine-grained audio
segments and a skeleton extracted from the speaker's reference image,
predicting skeletal motions through skeleton-audio feature fusion to ensure
strict audio coordination and body shape consistency. The generated skeletons
are then fed into an off-the-shelf human video generation model with the
speaker's reference image to synthesize high-fidelity videos. To democratize
research, we present CSG-405-the first public dataset with 405 hours of
high-resolution videos across 71 speech types, annotated with 2D skeletons and
diverse speaker demographics. Experiments show that our method exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality and synchronization while

*Juncheng Mu,Chengwei Ren,Weixiang Zhang,Liang Pan,Xiao-Ping Zhang,Yue Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff$^2$I2P提出了一种基于扩散先验的全可微分I2P配准框架，通过CSD和DCT模块解决模态差距和不可微问题，显著提升了配准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过度量学习实现跨模态特征对齐，但忽略了图像与点云数据间的模态差距，导致跨模态对应不准确。

Method: 提出Diff$^2$I2P框架，利用扩散先验和CSD技术优化变换预测，并通过DCT模块实现可微对应估计和PnP求解。

Result: 在7-Scenes基准上，Diff$^2$I2P比现有方法提升了7%以上的配准召回率。

Conclusion: Diff$^2$I2P通过扩散先验和可微设计，显著提升了跨模态配准性能。

Abstract: Learning cross-modal correspondences is essential for image-to-point cloud
(I2P) registration. Existing methods achieve this mostly by utilizing metric
learning to enforce feature alignment across modalities, disregarding the
inherent modality gap between image and point data. Consequently, this paradigm
struggles to ensure accurate cross-modal correspondences. To this end, inspired
by the cross-modal generation success of recent large diffusion models, we
propose Diff$^2$I2P, a fully Differentiable I2P registration framework,
leveraging a novel and effective Diffusion prior for bridging the modality gap.
Specifically, we propose a Control-Side Score Distillation (CSD) technique to
distill knowledge from a depth-conditioned diffusion model to directly optimize
the predicted transformation. However, the gradients on the transformation fail
to backpropagate onto the cross-modal features due to the non-differentiability
of correspondence retrieval and PnP solver. To this end, we further propose a
Deformable Correspondence Tuning (DCT) module to estimate the correspondences
in a differentiable way, followed by the transformation estimation using a
differentiable PnP solver. With these two designs, the Diffusion model serves
as a strong prior to guide the cross-modal feature learning of image and point
cloud for forming robust correspondences, which significantly improves the
registration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Diff$^2$I2P
consistently outperforms SoTA I2P registration methods, achieving over 7%
improvement in registration recall on the 7-Scenes benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合符号回归和轨迹引导图像到视频生成的新框架，以解决现有视频生成模型物理对齐不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散和自回归的视频生成模型虽然视觉真实感强，但缺乏物理准确性，无法模拟真实世界物体运动的动态。

Method: 通过提取输入视频的运动轨迹，利用检索式预训练增强符号回归，发现运动方程以预测物理准确的未来轨迹，并引导视频生成。

Result: 在经典力学场景（如弹簧-质量系统、摆锤和抛体运动）中，该方法成功恢复了真实解析方程，并提升了生成视频的物理对齐性。

Conclusion: 该框架无需微调现有模型，即可显著提升视频生成的物理准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based and autoregressive video generation models
have achieved remarkable visual realism. However, these models typically lack
accurate physical alignment, failing to replicate real-world dynamics in object
motion. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on learned
statistical correlations rather than capturing mechanisms adhering to physical
laws. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework that integrates
symbolic regression (SR) and trajectory-guided image-to-video (I2V) models for
physics-grounded video forecasting. Our approach extracts motion trajectories
from input videos, uses a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism to enhance
symbolic regression, and discovers equations of motion to forecast physically
accurate future trajectories. These trajectories then guide video generation
without requiring fine-tuning of existing models. Evaluated on scenarios in
Classical Mechanics, including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectile motions,
our method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and improves
the physical alignment of generated videos over baseline methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAP是一种新型对抗补丁攻击框架，通过感知感知定位和扰动优化方案生成高度不可见的对抗补丁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在目标攻击场景下表现不佳或生成的补丁缺乏上下文一致性，容易被人类或自动防御系统检测到。

Method: IAP结合类定位和敏感度图选择补丁位置，并使用感知感知正则化对抗损失和梯度更新规则优化不可见扰动。

Result: IAP在多种图像基准和模型架构中均取得高攻击成功率，同时显著提升补丁的不可见性。

Conclusion: IAP不仅对人类高度不可见，还能有效规避多种先进的补丁防御系统。

Abstract: Despite modifying only a small localized input region, adversarial patches
can drastically change the prediction of computer vision models. However, prior
methods either cannot perform satisfactorily under targeted attack scenarios or
fail to produce contextually coherent adversarial patches, causing them to be
easily noticeable by human examiners and insufficiently stealthy against
automatic patch defenses. In this paper, we introduce IAP, a novel attack
framework that generates highly invisible adversarial patches based on
perceptibility-aware localization and perturbation optimization schemes.
Specifically, IAP first searches for a proper location to place the patch by
leveraging classwise localization and sensitivity maps, balancing the
susceptibility of patch location to both victim model prediction and human
visual system, then employs a perceptibility-regularized adversarial loss and a
gradient update rule that prioritizes color constancy for optimizing invisible
perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across various image benchmarks and
model architectures demonstrate that IAP consistently achieves competitive
attack success rates in targeted settings with significantly improved patch
invisibility compared to existing baselines. In addition to being highly
imperceptible to humans, IAP is shown to be stealthy enough to render several
state-of-the-art patch defenses ineffective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像恢复中表现出色，但先验和似然梯度方向的冲突及梯度波动问题未被充分研究，影响了生成过程的稳定性。

Method: 提出SPGD技术，包括渐进似然预热策略和自适应方向动量平滑，以缓解梯度冲突和减少梯度波动。

Result: 实验表明SPGD显著提升了生成稳定性，在多种恢复任务中取得了定量和视觉上的最佳性能。

Conclusion: SPGD通过梯度管理解决了扩散模型中的不稳定性问题，为图像恢复提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable promise for image restoration by
leveraging powerful priors. Prominent methods typically frame the restoration
problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a
denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions
between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In
this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and
identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts
between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal
fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these
instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration
performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive
Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD
integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up
strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum
(ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive
experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD
significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results. Code is

TL;DR: FlexGaussian是一种无需重新训练的3D高斯压缩方法，结合混合精度量化和属性判别剪枝，实现高效压缩，适用于移动设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模3D模型的需求增长需要有效的压缩方法，现有方法缺乏灵活性且需要重新训练。

Method: 采用混合精度量化和属性判别剪枝技术，无需重新训练。

Result: 压缩率高达96.4%，渲染质量损失小（PSNR下降<1 dB），速度比现有方法快1.7-2.1倍。

Conclusion: FlexGaussian是一种灵活且高效的压缩方法，适用于资源受限的设备。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting has become a prominent technique for representing and
rendering complex 3D scenes, due to its high fidelity and speed advantages.
However, the growing demand for large-scale models calls for effective
compression to reduce memory and computation costs, especially on mobile and
edge devices with limited resources. Existing compression methods effectively
reduce 3D Gaussian parameters but often require extensive retraining or
fine-tuning, lacking flexibility under varying compression constraints.
  In this paper, we introduce FlexGaussian, a flexible and cost-effective
method that combines mixed-precision quantization with attribute-discriminative
pruning for training-free 3D Gaussian compression. FlexGaussian eliminates the
need for retraining and adapts easily to diverse compression targets.
Evaluation results show that FlexGaussian achieves up to 96.4% compression
while maintaining high rendering quality (<1 dB drop in PSNR), and is
deployable on mobile devices. FlexGaussian delivers high compression ratios
within seconds, being 1.7-2.1x faster than state-of-the-art training-free
methods and 10-100x faster than training-involved approaches. The code is being
prepared and will be released soon at:

Motivation: 现有方法在文本提示中仅包含对象类别信息，不足以让模型准确区分计数任务中的对象数量。

Method: 提出QUANet，包括数量导向的文本提示、视觉-文本数量对齐损失、双流自适应计数解码器（Transformer流、CNN流和T2C适配器）以及跨流数量排序损失。

Result: 在FSC-147、CARPK、PUCPR+和ShanghaiTech等标准基准测试中表现出强大的零样本类无关计数泛化能力。

Conclusion: QUANet通过创新的数量感知设计和双流解码器，显著提升了文本提示对象计数的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
progress in solving the text-promptable object counting problem. Representative
methods typically specify text prompts with object category information in
images. This however is insufficient for training the model to accurately
distinguish the number of objects in the counting task. To this end, we propose
QUANet, which introduces novel quantity-oriented text prompts with a
vision-text quantity alignment loss to enhance the model's quantity awareness.
Moreover, we propose a dual-stream adaptive counting decoder consisting of a
Transformer stream, a CNN stream, and a number of Transformer-to-CNN
enhancement adapters (T2C-adapters) for density map prediction. The
T2C-adapters facilitate the effective knowledge communication and aggregation
between the Transformer and CNN streams. A cross-stream quantity ranking loss
is proposed in the end to optimize the ranking orders of predictions from the
two streams. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks such as FSC-147,
CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech demonstrate our model's strong generalizability
for zero-shot class-agnostic counting. Code is available at

Conclusion: STG-Mamba在舞蹈视频合成任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We propose a novel spatial-temporal graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) for the
music-guided dance video synthesis task, i.e., to translate the input music to
a dance video. STG-Mamba consists of two translation mappings:
music-to-skeleton translation and skeleton-to-video translation. In the
music-to-skeleton translation, we introduce a novel spatial-temporal graph
Mamba (STGM) block to effectively construct skeleton sequences from the input
music, capturing dependencies between joints in both the spatial and temporal
dimensions. For the skeleton-to-video translation, we propose a novel
self-supervised regularization network to translate the generated skeletons,
along with a conditional image, into a dance video. Lastly, we collect a new
skeleton-to-video translation dataset from the Internet, containing 54,944
video clips. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STG-Mamba achieves
significantly better results than existing methods.

TL;DR: CheXPO是一种针对胸部X光图像的多任务视觉指令优化策略，通过联合挖掘置信度-相似性和反事实推理，减少幻觉问题，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在医学应用中易产生幻觉，影响可靠性。传统偏好优化方法面临临床无关样本、数据分布不平衡和专家标注成本高等问题。

Method: 结合置信度-相似性联合挖掘与反事实推理，构建多任务胸部X光视觉指令数据集，并通过硬样本扩展和反事实推理优化偏好样本分布。

Result: CheXPO仅用5%的监督微调样本即实现8.93%的相对性能提升，达到多种临床任务的先进水平。

Conclusion: CheXPO为放射学应用提供了一种可扩展、可解释的解决方案，有效减少幻觉问题。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are prone to hallucinations that critically
compromise reliability in medical applications. While preference optimization
can mitigate these hallucinations through clinical feedback, its implementation
faces challenges such as clinically irrelevant training samples, imbalanced
data distributions, and prohibitive expert annotation costs. To address these
challenges, we introduce CheXPO, a Chest X-ray Preference Optimization strategy
that combines confidence-similarity joint mining with counterfactual rationale.
Our approach begins by synthesizing a unified, fine-grained multi-task chest
X-ray visual instruction dataset across different question types for supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). We then identify hard examples through token-level
confidence analysis of SFT failures and use similarity-based retrieval to
expand hard examples for balancing preference sample distributions, while
synthetic counterfactual rationales provide fine-grained clinical preferences,
eliminating the need for additional expert input. Experiments show that CheXPO
achieves 8.93% relative performance gain using only 5% of SFT samples, reaching
state-of-the-art performance across diverse clinical tasks and providing a
scalable, interpretable solution for real-world radiology applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在放射学报告生成中难以准确映射病理和解剖特征到文本描述，且语义无关的特征提取影响了报告的准确性。

Method: MCA-RG利用病理库和解剖库对齐视觉特征，采用对比学习和匹配损失优化特征，并通过特征门控机制过滤低质量概念特征。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和CheXpert Plus基准测试中，MCA-RG表现出色。

Conclusion: MCA-RG通过知识驱动的方法显著提升了放射学报告生成的准确性和临床相关性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for
radiology report generation (RRG), clinical adoption remains challenging due to
difficulties in accurately mapping pathological and anatomical features to
their corresponding text descriptions. Additionally, semantic agnostic feature
extraction further hampers the generation of accurate diagnostic reports. To
address these challenges, we introduce Medical Concept Aligned Radiology Report
Generation (MCA-RG), a knowledge-driven framework that explicitly aligns visual
features with distinct medical concepts to enhance the report generation
process. MCA-RG utilizes two curated concept banks: a pathology bank containing
lesion-related knowledge, and an anatomy bank with anatomical descriptions. The
visual features are aligned with these medical concepts and undergo tailored
enhancement. We further propose an anatomy-based contrastive learning procedure
to improve the generalization of anatomical features, coupled with a matching
loss for pathological features to prioritize clinically relevant regions.
Additionally, a feature gating mechanism is employed to filter out low-quality
concept features. Finally, the visual features are corresponding to individual
medical concepts, and are leveraged to guide the report generation process.
Experiments on two public benchmarks (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus) demonstrate
that MCA-RG achieves superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in
radiology report generation.

Motivation: 解决现有手语翻译方法在端到端学习中视觉与文本表示差异的问题。

Method: 采用分层特征提取（帧、片段、视频级）结合伪注释和对比对齐策略。

Result: 实验显示方法在BLEU-4和ROUGE分数上表现更优且高效。

Conclusion: 分层预训练策略有效提升了手语翻译的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) attempts to convert sign language videos into
spoken sentences. However, many existing methods struggle with the disparity
between visual and textual representations during end-to-end learning.
Gloss-based approaches help to bridge this gap by leveraging structured
linguistic information. While, gloss-free methods offer greater flexibility and
remove the burden of annotation, they require effective alignment strategies.
Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled gloss-free SLT by
generating text-like representations from sign videos. In this work, we
introduce a novel hierarchical pre-training strategy inspired by the structure
of sign language, incorporating pseudo-glosses and contrastive video-language
alignment. Our method hierarchically extracts features at frame, segment, and
video levels, aligning them with pseudo-glosses and the spoken sentence to
enhance translation quality. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves
BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores while maintaining efficiency.

Method: 构建了一个包含3D CT图像和临床记录的大规模数据集，并提出了一种跨模态掩码学习方法，结合Slice-Depth Transformer和基于图的Transformer进行特征提取与融合。

Result: 该方法在多模态整合中表现优异，超越了现有方法，为NSCLC预后模型设定了新基准。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了生存预测的准确性，为个性化治疗提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Accurate prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing
immunotherapy is essential for personalized treatment planning, enabling
informed patient decisions, and improving both treatment outcomes and quality
of life. However, the lack of large, relevant datasets and effective
multi-modal feature fusion strategies pose significant challenges in this
domain. To address these challenges, we present a large-scale dataset and
introduce a novel framework for multi-modal feature fusion aimed at enhancing
the accuracy of survival prediction. The dataset comprises 3D CT images and
corresponding clinical records from NSCLC patients treated with immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), along with progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) data. We further propose a cross-modality masked learning
approach for medical feature fusion, consisting of two distinct branches, each
tailored to its respective modality: a Slice-Depth Transformer for extracting
3D features from CT images and a graph-based Transformer for learning node
features and relationships among clinical variables in tabular data. The fusion
process is guided by a masked modality learning strategy, wherein the model
utilizes the intact modality to reconstruct missing components. This mechanism
improves the integration of modality-specific features, fostering more
effective inter-modality relationships and feature interactions. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance in multi-modal integration for NSCLC survival
prediction, surpassing existing methods and setting a new benchmark for
prognostic models in this context.

Abstract: Medical anomaly detection (AD) is challenging due to diverse imaging
modalities, anatomical variations, and limited labeled data. We propose a novel
approach combining visual adapters and prompt learning with Partial Optimal
Transport (POT) and contrastive learning (CL) to improve CLIP's adaptability to
medical images, particularly for AD. Unlike standard prompt learning, which
often yields a single representation, our method employs multiple prompts
aligned with local features via POT to capture subtle abnormalities. CL further
enforces intra-class cohesion and inter-class separation. Our method achieves

Result: 实验验证RPFNet能有效整合特征、增强细节和显著物体，支持高级视觉任务。

Conclusion: RPFNet通过频域建模和残差先验，高效解决了图像融合中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Image fusion aims to integrate complementary information across modalities to
generate high-quality fused images, thereby enhancing the performance of
high-level vision tasks. While global spatial modeling mechanisms show
promising results, constructing long-range feature dependencies in the spatial
domain incurs substantial computational costs. Additionally, the absence of
ground-truth exacerbates the difficulty of capturing complementary features
effectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Residual Prior-driven
Frequency-aware Network, termed as RPFNet. Specifically, RPFNet employs a
dual-branch feature extraction framework: the Residual Prior Module (RPM)
extracts modality-specific difference information from residual maps, thereby
providing complementary priors for fusion; the Frequency Domain Fusion Module
(FDFM) achieves efficient global feature modeling and integration through
frequency-domain convolution. Additionally, the Cross Promotion Module (CPM)
enhances the synergistic perception of local details and global structures
through bidirectional feature interaction. During training, we incorporate an
auxiliary decoder and saliency structure loss to strengthen the model's
sensitivity to modality-specific differences. Furthermore, a combination of
adaptive weight-based frequency contrastive loss and SSIM loss effectively
constrains the solution space, facilitating the joint capture of local details
and global features while ensuring the retention of complementary information.
Extensive experiments validate the fusion performance of RPFNet, which
effectively integrates discriminative features, enhances texture details and
salient objects, and can effectively facilitate the deployment of the
high-level vision task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限元方法（FEM）计算Laplace-Beltrami谱时复杂度高，不适用于频繁处理大规模CAD机械零件数据库或快速质量控制的场景。

Method: 采用图神经网络架构，利用丰富的网格特征（如高斯曲率、平均曲率和主曲率）进行预测，并提供了用于训练和测试的公开数据集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将计算时间缩短至线性FEM的约1/5，同时保持竞争力准确性。

Conclusion: 证明了Laplace-Beltrami谱的可学习性，为几何深度学习在高效计算中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operator is central in geometric
deep learning tasks, capturing intrinsic properties of the shape of the object
under consideration. The best established method for its estimation, from a
triangulated mesh of the object, is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM),
and computes the top k LB eigenvalues with a complexity of O(Nk), where N is
the number of points. This can render the FEM method inefficient when
repeatedly applied to databases of CAD mechanical parts, or in quality control
applications where part metrology is acquired as large meshes and decisions
about the quality of each part are needed quickly and frequently. As a solution
to this problem, we present a geometric deep learning framework to predict the
LB spectrum efficiently given the CAD mesh of a part, achieving significant
computational savings without sacrificing accuracy, demonstrating that the LB
spectrum is learnable. The proposed Graph Neural Network architecture uses a
rich set of part mesh features - including Gaussian curvature, mean curvature,
and principal curvatures. In addition to our trained network, we make
available, for repeatability, a large curated dataset of real-world mechanical
CAD models derived from the publicly available ABC dataset used for training
and testing. Experimental results show that our method reduces computation time
of the LB spectrum by approximately 5 times over linear FEM while delivering
competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video generation, inference speed remains a major
bottleneck. A common acceleration strategy involves reusing model outputs via
caching mechanisms at fixed intervals. However, we find that such
fixed-frequency reuse significantly degrades quality in complex scenes, while
manually tuning reuse thresholds is inefficient and lacks robustness. To
address this, we propose Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that
automatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated
directly from the input prompt. By incorporating prompt-derived semantic cues,
PCA enables more adaptive and informed reuse decisions than conventional
caching methods. We also revisit the assumptions behind TeaCache and identify a
key limitation: it suffers from poor input-output relationship modeling due to
an oversimplified prior. To overcome this, we decouple the noisy input, enhance
the contribution of meaningful textual information, and improve the model's
predictive accuracy through multivariate polynomial feature expansion. To
further reduce computational cost, we replace the static CFGCache with
DynCFGCache, a dynamic mechanism that selectively reuses classifier-free
guidance (CFG) outputs based on estimated output variations. This allows for
more flexible reuse without compromising output quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach achieves significant acceleration-for example,
2.79x speedup on the Wan2.1 model-while maintaining high visual fidelity across
a range of scenes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为D2I的框架，通过规则奖励提升多模态语言模型的理解和推理能力，无需额外标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态推理研究中模态对齐和训练成本高的问题。

Method: 采用D2I框架，训练时使用规则奖励增强模态对齐，评估时转为直觉推理。

Result: D2I在多个基准测试中优于基线模型。

Conclusion: D2I展示了规则奖励在提升模型推理能力中的作用，并启发了训练与测试推理深度的解耦。

Abstract: Reasoning is a key capability for large language models (LLMs), particularly
when applied to complex tasks such as mathematical problem solving. However,
multimodal reasoning research still requires further exploration of modality
alignment and training costs. Many of these approaches rely on additional data
annotation and relevant rule-based rewards to enhance the understanding and
reasoning ability, which significantly increases training costs and limits
scalability. To address these challenges, we propose the
Deliberate-to-Intuitive reasoning framework (D2I) that improves the
understanding and reasoning ability of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) without extra
annotations and complex rewards. Specifically, our method sets deliberate
reasoning strategies to enhance modality alignment only through the rule-based
format reward during training. While evaluating, the reasoning style shifts to
intuitive, which removes deliberate reasoning strategies during training and
implicitly reflects the model's acquired abilities in the response. D2I
outperforms baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. Our
findings highlight the role of format reward in fostering transferable
reasoning skills in MLLMs, and inspire directions for decoupling training-time
reasoning depth from test-time response flexibility.

Motivation: 现有方法难以处理复杂的一对多身份关系，限制了性能提升，因此需要更有效的机制。

Method: 局部层面显式建立跨模态身份关系，全局层面构建动态跨模态身份关联网络，并结合信息不对称样本对和一致性学习。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提高了跨模态匹配的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为文本到人物图像匹配提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly supervised text-to-person image matching, as a crucial approach to
reducing models' reliance on large-scale manually labeled samples, holds
significant research value. However, existing methods struggle to predict
complex one-to-many identity relationships, severely limiting performance
improvements. To address this challenge, we propose a local-and-global
dual-granularity identity association mechanism. Specifically, at the local
level, we explicitly establish cross-modal identity relationships within a
batch, reinforcing identity constraints across different modalities and
enabling the model to better capture subtle differences and correlations. At
the global level, we construct a dynamic cross-modal identity association
network with the visual modality as the anchor and introduce a confidence-based
dynamic adjustment mechanism, effectively enhancing the model's ability to
identify weakly associated samples while improving overall sensitivity.
Additionally, we propose an information-asymmetric sample pair construction
method combined with consistency learning to tackle hard sample mining and
enhance model robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method substantially boosts cross-modal matching accuracy, providing an
efficient and practical solution for text-to-person image matching.

Motivation: 满文作为一种濒危语言，对研究早期现代东亚历史至关重要，但缺乏有效的OCR系统处理真实历史文档。

Method: 研究通过参数高效训练，在6万张合成的满文单词图像上微调了三个开源视觉语言模型（LLaMA-3.2-11B、Qwen2.5-VL-7B、Qwen2.5-VL-3B）。

Result: LLaMA-3.2-11B在合成数据上表现优异（98.3%单词准确率），并在真实手写文档上保持93.1%准确率，远超传统方法（CRNN基线在真实文档上仅72.5%）。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了合成到真实领域的有效迁移，为濒危语言OCR提供了低成本解决方案，推动了数字人文领域的发展。

Abstract: Manchu, a critically endangered language essential for understanding early
modern Eastern Eurasian history, lacks effective OCR systems that can handle
real-world historical documents. This study develops high-performing OCR
systems by fine-tuning three open-source vision-language models (LLaMA-3.2-11B,
Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on 60,000 synthetic Manchu word images using
parameter-efficient training. LLaMA-3.2-11B achieved exceptional performance
with 98.3\% word accuracy and 0.0024 character error rate on synthetic data,
while crucially maintaining 93.1\% accuracy on real-world handwritten
documents. Comparative evaluation reveals substantial advantages over
traditional approaches: while a CRNN baseline achieved 99.8\% synthetic
accuracy, it suffered severe degradation to 72.5\% on real documents. Our
approach demonstrates effective synthetic-to-real domain transfer, providing a
cost-effective solution deployable on accessible infrastructure. This work
establishes a transferable framework for endangered language OCR that removes
technical and financial barriers in digital humanities, enabling historians and
linguists to process historical archives without specialized computing
resources. Code and model weights are available at

Abstract: Thermal imaging from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) holds significant
potential for applications in search and rescue, wildlife monitoring, and
emergency response, especially under low-light or obscured conditions. However,
the scarcity of large-scale, diverse thermal aerial datasets limits the
advancement of deep learning models in this domain, primarily due to the high
cost and logistical challenges of collecting thermal data. In this work, we
introduce a novel procedural pipeline for generating synthetic thermal images
from an aerial perspective. Our method integrates arbitrary object classes into
existing thermal backgrounds by providing control over the position, scale, and
orientation of the new objects, while aligning them with the viewpoints of the
background. We enhance existing thermal datasets by introducing new object
categories, specifically adding a drone class in urban environments to the
HIT-UAV dataset and an animal category to the MONET dataset. In evaluating
these datasets for object detection task, we showcase strong performance across
both new and existing classes, validating the successful expansion into new
applications. Through comparative analysis, we show that thermal detectors
outperform their visible-light-trained counterparts and highlight the
importance of replicating aerial viewing angles. Project page:

Result: 预训练模型在性状预测中优于现有监督基线，显著提升了光谱表示学习的效果。

Conclusion: GreenHyperSpectra为植物功能性状评估与表示学习的交叉研究提供了方法论框架和数据支持。

Abstract: Plant traits such as leaf carbon content and leaf mass are essential
variables in the study of biodiversity and climate change. However,
conventional field sampling cannot feasibly cover trait variation at
ecologically meaningful spatial scales. Machine learning represents a valuable
solution for plant trait prediction across ecosystems, leveraging hyperspectral
data from remote sensing. Nevertheless, trait prediction from hyperspectral
data is challenged by label scarcity and substantial domain shifts (\eg across
sensors, ecological distributions), requiring robust cross-domain methods.
Here, we present GreenHyperSpectra, a pretraining dataset encompassing
real-world cross-sensor and cross-ecosystem samples designed to benchmark trait
prediction with semi- and self-supervised methods. We adopt an evaluation
framework encompassing in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. We
successfully leverage GreenHyperSpectra to pretrain label-efficient
multi-output regression models that outperform the state-of-the-art supervised
baseline. Our empirical analyses demonstrate substantial improvements in
learning spectral representations for trait prediction, establishing a
comprehensive methodological framework to catalyze research at the intersection
of representation learning and plant functional traits assessment. All code and

Motivation: 现有基于sRGB和HSV颜色空间的低光图像增强方法存在颜色偏差和噪声问题，需要更优解决方案。

Method: 提出HVI颜色空间和HVI-CIDNet+网络，利用预训练视觉语言模型提取上下文知识，并通过Prior-guided Attention Block和Region Refinement Block优化内容恢复和颜色校正。

Result: 在10个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HVI颜色空间和HVI-CIDNet+网络有效解决了低光图像增强中的颜色偏差和噪声问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) aims to restore vivid content and details
from corrupted low-light images. However, existing standard RGB (sRGB) color
space-based LLIE methods often produce color bias and brightness artifacts due
to the inherent high color sensitivity. While Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV)
color space can decouple brightness and color, it introduces significant red
and black noise artifacts. To address this problem, we propose a new color
space for LLIE, namely Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI), defined by the HV
color map and learnable intensity. The HV color map enforces small distances
for the red coordinates to remove red noise artifacts, while the learnable
intensity compresses the low-light regions to remove black noise artifacts.
Additionally, we introduce the Color and Intensity Decoupling Network+
(HVI-CIDNet+), built upon the HVI color space, to restore damaged content and
mitigate color distortion in extremely dark regions. Specifically, HVI-CIDNet+
leverages abundant contextual and degraded knowledge extracted from low-light
images using pre-trained vision-language models, integrated via a novel
Prior-guided Attention Block (PAB). Within the PAB, latent semantic priors can
promote content restoration, while degraded representations guide precise color
correction, both particularly in extremely dark regions through the
meticulously designed cross-attention fusion mechanism. Furthermore, we
construct a Region Refinement Block that employs convolution for
information-rich regions and self-attention for information-scarce regions,
ensuring accurate brightness adjustments. Comprehensive results from benchmark
experiments demonstrate that the proposed HVI-CIDNet+ outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) is a challenging problem that
has been extensively studied in recent years. Traditional approaches often rely
on external modules like Class Activation Maps to highlight regions of interest
and generate pseudo segmentation masks. In this work, we propose an end-to-end
method that directly utilizes the attention maps learned by a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for WSSS. We propose training a sparse ViT with multiple
[CLS] tokens (one for each class), using a random masking strategy to promote
[CLS] token - class assignment. At inference time, we aggregate the different
self-attention maps of each [CLS] token corresponding to the predicted labels
to generate pseudo segmentation masks. Our proposed approach enhances the
interpretability of self-attention maps and ensures accurate class assignments.
Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks and three specialized datasets
demonstrate that our method generates accurate pseudo-masks, outperforming
related works. Those pseudo-masks can be used to train a segmentation model
which achieves results comparable to fully-supervised models, significantly
reducing the need for fine-grained labeled data.

Abstract: Semantic scene understanding, including the perception and classification of
moving agents, is essential to enabling safe and robust driving behaviours of
autonomous vehicles. Cameras and LiDARs are commonly used for semantic scene
understanding. However, both sensor modalities face limitations in adverse
weather and usually do not provide motion information. Radar sensors overcome
these limitations and directly offer information about moving agents by
measuring the Doppler velocity, but the measurements are comparably sparse and
noisy. In this paper, we address the problem of panoptic segmentation in sparse
radar point clouds to enhance scene understanding. Our approach, called
SemRaFiner, accounts for changing density in sparse radar point clouds and
optimizes the feature extraction to improve accuracy. Furthermore, we propose
an optimized training procedure to refine instance assignments by incorporating
a dedicated data augmentation. Our experiments suggest that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods for radar-based panoptic segmentation.

Result: APL显著提升了细粒度数据集上的性能。

Conclusion: APL通过自适应部分学习，有效解决了GCD任务中的判别性与泛化性权衡问题。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to recognize unlabeled images from
known and novel classes by distinguishing novel classes from known ones, while
also transferring knowledge from another set of labeled images with known
classes. Existing GCD methods rely on self-supervised vision transformers such
as DINO for representation learning. However, focusing solely on the global
representation of the DINO CLS token introduces an inherent trade-off between
discriminability and generalization. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive
part discovery and learning method, called APL, which generates consistent
object parts and their correspondences across different similar images using a
set of shared learnable part queries and DINO part priors, without requiring
any additional annotations. More importantly, we propose a novel all-min
contrastive loss to learn discriminative yet generalizable part representation,
which adaptively highlights discriminative object parts to distinguish similar
categories for enhanced discriminability while simultaneously sharing other
parts to facilitate knowledge transfer for improved generalization. Our APL can
easily be incorporated into different GCD frameworks by replacing their CLS
token feature with our part representations, showing significant enhancements
on fine-grained datasets.

Conclusion: MCCD填补了详细书法数据集的空白，为多领域研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Research on the attribute information of calligraphy, such as styles,
dynasties, and calligraphers, holds significant cultural and historical value.
However, the styles of Chinese calligraphy characters have evolved dramatically
through different dynasties and the unique touches of calligraphers, making it
highly challenging to accurately recognize these different characters and their
attributes. Furthermore, existing calligraphic datasets are extremely scarce,
and most provide only character-level annotations without additional attribute
information. This limitation has significantly hindered the in-depth study of
Chinese calligraphy. To fill this gap, we present a novel Multi-Attribute
Chinese Calligraphy Character Dataset (MCCD). The dataset encompasses 7,765
categories with a total of 329,715 isolated image samples of Chinese
calligraphy characters, and three additional subsets were extracted based on
the attribute labeling of the three types of script styles (10 types),
dynasties (15 periods) and calligraphers (142 individuals). The rich
multi-attribute annotations render MCCD well-suited diverse research tasks,
including calligraphic character recognition, writer identification, and
evolutionary studies of Chinese characters. We establish benchmark performance
through single-task and multi-task recognition experiments across MCCD and all
of its subsets. The experimental results demonstrate that the complexity of the
stroke structure of the calligraphic characters, and the interplay between
their different attributes, leading to a substantial increase in the difficulty
of accurate recognition. MCCD not only fills a void in the availability of
detailed calligraphy datasets but also provides valuable resources for
advancing research in Chinese calligraphy and fostering advancements in
multiple fields. The dataset is available at

Abstract: Ancient populations markedly transformed Neotropical forests, yet
understanding the long-term effects of ancient human management, particularly
at high-resolution scales, remains challenging. In this work we propose a new
approach to investigate archaeological areas of influence based on vegetation
signatures. It consists of a deep learning model trained on satellite imagery
to identify palm trees, followed by a clustering algorithm to identify palm
clusters, which are then used to estimate ancient management areas. To assess
the palm distribution in relation to past human activity, we applied the
proposed approach to unique high-resolution satellite imagery data covering 765
km2 of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia. With this work, we also
release a manually annotated palm tree dataset along with estimated locations
of archaeological sites from ground-surveys and legacy records. Results
demonstrate how palms were significantly more abundant near archaeological
sites showing large infrastructure investment. The extent of the largest palm
cluster indicates that ancient human-managed areas linked to major
infrastructure sites may be up to two orders of magnitude bigger than indicated
by archaeological evidence alone. Our findings suggest that pre-Columbian
populations influenced local vegetation fostering conditions conducive to palm
proliferation, leaving a lasting ecological footprint. This may have lowered
the logistical costs of establishing infrastructure-heavy settlements in
otherwise less accessible locations. Overall, this study demonstrates the
potential of integrating artificial intelligence approaches with new ecological
and archaeological data to identify archaeological areas of interest through
vegetation patterns, revealing fine-scale human-environment interactions.

Abstract: Background: Accurate deformable image registration (DIR) is required for
contour propagation and dose accumulation in MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy
(MRgART). This study trained and evaluated a deep learning DIR method for
domain invariant MR-MR registration. Methods: A progressively refined
registration and segmentation (ProRSeg) method was trained with 262 pairs of 3T
MR simulation scans from prostate cancer patients using weighted segmentation
consistency loss. ProRSeg was tested on same- (58 pairs), cross- (72 1.5T MR
Linac pairs), and mixed-domain (42 MRSim-MRL pairs) datasets for contour
propagation accuracy of clinical target volume (CTV), bladder, and rectum. Dose
accumulation was performed for 42 patients undergoing 5-fraction MRgART.
Results: ProRSeg demonstrated generalization for bladder with similar Dice
Similarity Coefficients across domains (0.88, 0.87, 0.86). For rectum and CTV,
performance was domain-dependent with higher accuracy on cross-domain MRL
dataset (DSCs 0.89) versus same-domain data. The model's strong cross-domain
performance prompted us to study the feasibility of using it for dose
accumulation. Dose accumulation showed 83.3% of patients met CTV coverage (D95
>= 40.0 Gy) and bladder sparing (D50 <= 20.0 Gy) constraints. All patients
achieved minimum mean target dose (>40.4 Gy), but only 9.5% remained under
upper limit (<42.0 Gy). Conclusions: ProRSeg showed reasonable multi-domain
MR-MR registration performance for prostate cancer patients with preliminary
feasibility for evaluating treatment compliance to clinical constraints.

large-scale ecological surveys. We present the Mixed Arthropod Sample
Segmentation and Identification (MassID45) dataset for training automatic
classifiers of bulk insect samples. It uniquely combines molecular and imaging
data at both the unsorted sample level and the full set of individual
specimens. Human annotators, supported by an AI-assisted tool, performed two
tasks on bulk images: creating segmentation masks around each individual
arthropod and assigning taxonomic labels to over 17 000 specimens. Combining
the taxonomic resolution of DNA barcodes with precise abundance estimates of
bulk images holds great potential for rapid, large-scale characterization of
insect communities. This dataset pushes the boundaries of tiny object detection
and instance segmentation, fostering innovation in both ecological and machine
learning research.

### [74] [Free on the Fly: Enhancing Flexibility in Test-Time Adaptation with Online EM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06973)
*Qiyuan Dai,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeTTA是一种无需训练、通用的测试时适应方法，通过在线EM算法利用视觉语言模型的零样本预测作为先验，显著提升跨域和分布外数据集的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在实际应用中因域偏移和分布变化而受限，传统测试时适应方法依赖昂贵训练或不现实假设，FreeTTA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出FreeTTA，通过在线EM算法利用零样本预测作为先验，迭代更新测试样本的后验概率和参数，无需训练或历史数据。

Result: 在15个跨域和分布外数据集上，FreeTTA表现稳定且显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeTTA首次显式建模测试数据分布，利用样本间内在关系提升预测，为测试时适应提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become prominent in open-world image
recognition for their strong generalization abilities. Yet, their effectiveness
in practical applications is compromised by domain shifts and distributional
changes, especially when test data distributions diverge from training data.
Therefore, the paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged, enabling the
use of online off-the-shelf data at test time, supporting independent sample
predictions, and eliminating reliance on test annotations. Traditional TTA
methods, however, often rely on costly training or optimization processes, or
make unrealistic assumptions about accessing or storing historical training and
test data. Instead, this study proposes FreeTTA, a training-free and
universally available method that makes no assumptions, to enhance the
flexibility of TTA. More importantly, FreeTTA is the first to explicitly model
the test data distribution, enabling the use of intrinsic relationships among
test samples to enhance predictions of individual samples without simultaneous
access--a direction not previously explored. FreeTTA achieves these advantages
by introducing an online EM algorithm that utilizes zero-shot predictions from
VLMs as priors to iteratively compute the posterior probabilities of each
online test sample and update parameters. Experiments demonstrate that FreeTTA
achieves stable and significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across 15 datasets in both cross-domain and out-of-distribution
settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DenoiseCP-Net的新型多任务架构，用于恶劣天气下的LiDAR集体感知，通过去噪和对象检测的统一设计，显著降低了带宽需求和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆的感知系统在恶劣天气下易受传感器性能下降的影响，集体感知虽能弥补这一缺陷，但相关研究较少。

Method: 提出DenoiseCP-Net，结合体素级去噪和对象检测，采用稀疏卷积骨干网络，减少冗余计算和通信开销。

Result: 在模拟恶劣天气的OPV2V数据集上，DenoiseCP-Net实现了近乎完美的去噪效果，带宽需求降低23.6%，同时保持检测精度并减少延迟。

Conclusion: DenoiseCP-Net为恶劣天气下的集体感知提供了一种高效解决方案，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: While automated vehicles hold the potential to significantly reduce traffic
accidents, their perception systems remain vulnerable to sensor degradation
caused by adverse weather and environmental occlusions. Collective perception,
which enables vehicles to share information, offers a promising approach to
overcoming these limitations. However, to this date collective perception in
adverse weather is mostly unstudied. Therefore, we conduct the first study of
LiDAR-based collective perception under diverse weather conditions and present
a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective perception under
adverse weather. Adverse weather conditions can not only degrade perception
capabilities, but also negatively affect bandwidth requirements and latency due
to the introduced noise that is also transmitted and processed. Denoising prior
to communication can effectively mitigate these issues. Therefore, we propose
DenoiseCP-Net, a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective
perception under adverse weather conditions. DenoiseCP-Net integrates
voxel-level noise filtering and object detection into a unified sparse
convolution backbone, eliminating redundant computations associated with
two-stage pipelines. This design not only reduces inference latency and
computational cost but also minimizes communication overhead by removing
non-informative noise. We extended the well-known OPV2V dataset by simulating
rain, snow, and fog using our realistic weather simulation models. We
demonstrate that DenoiseCP-Net achieves near-perfect denoising accuracy in
adverse weather, reduces the bandwidth requirements by up to 23.6% while
maintaining the same detection accuracy and reducing the inference latency for
cooperative vehicles.

Result: 在BreakHis和PatchGastric数据集上，分类F1得分0.934，AUC 0.963；描述BLEU-4得分0.811，METEOR得分0.569。

Conclusion: GNN-ViTCap优于现有方法，为显微镜诊断提供高效可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Microscopic assessment of histopathology images is vital for accurate cancer
diagnosis and treatment. Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning
have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI
face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to
subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology
captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce
a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from
histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor
generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically
clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting
representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph
by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and
apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The
aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space
through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large
language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric
datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for
classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569
for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms
state of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for
microscopy based patient diagnosis.

Motivation: 数字病理学和深度学习的快速发展为病理基础模型的出现提供了条件，这些模型有望解决多种疾病条件下的病理问题。同时，空间转录组学技术的出现为从H&E染色图像中获取更细粒度的基因表达信息提供了机会。

Method: 通过从预训练的病理基础模型中提取信息丰富的特征嵌入，训练一个轻量级多层感知器（MLP）回归器，预测细胞类型丰度。

Conclusion: 该方法为从H&E染色图像中高效预测细胞组成提供了一种可行的解决方案，避免了昂贵的空间转录组学实验。

Abstract: The rapid development of digital pathology and modern deep learning has
facilitated the emergence of pathology foundation models that are expected to
solve general pathology problems under various disease conditions in one
unified model, with or without fine-tuning. In parallel, spatial
transcriptomics has emerged as a transformative technology that enables the
profiling of gene expression on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histology
images. Spatial transcriptomics unlocks the unprecedented opportunity to dive
into existing histology images at a more granular, cellular level. In this
work, we propose a lightweight and training-efficient approach to predict
cellular composition directly from H&E-stained histology images by leveraging
information-enriched feature embeddings extracted from pre-trained pathology
foundation models. By training a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
regressor on cell-type abundances derived via cell2location, our method
efficiently distills knowledge from pathology foundation models and
demonstrates the ability to accurately predict cell-type compositions from
histology images, without physically performing the costly spatial
transcriptomics. Our method demonstrates competitive performance compared to
existing methods such as Hist2Cell, while significantly reducing computational
complexity.

Conclusion: MST-Distill通过动态教师模型和掩码模块有效解决了跨模态知识蒸馏的挑战，为相关任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation as an efficient knowledge transfer technique, has
achieved remarkable success in unimodal scenarios. However, in cross-modal
settings, conventional distillation methods encounter significant challenges
due to data and statistical heterogeneities, failing to leverage the
complementary prior knowledge embedded in cross-modal teacher models. This
paper empirically reveals two critical issues in existing approaches:
distillation path selection and knowledge drift. To address these limitations,
we propose MST-Distill, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework
featuring a mixture of specialized teachers. Our approach employs a diverse
ensemble of teacher models across both cross-modal and multimodal
configurations, integrated with an instance-level routing network that
facilitates adaptive and dynamic distillation. This architecture effectively
transcends the constraints of traditional methods that rely on monotonous and
static teacher models. Additionally, we introduce a plug-in masking module,
independently trained to suppress modality-specific discrepancies and
reconstruct teacher representations, thereby mitigating knowledge drift and
enhancing transfer effectiveness. Extensive experiments across five diverse
multimodal datasets, spanning visual, audio, and text, demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art knowledge
distillation methods in cross-modal distillation tasks. The source code is

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何通过整合上下文元数据（如GPS、时间戳和食物信息）提升大型多模态模型（LMMs）在营养分析中的表现，并引入新数据集ACETADA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估专有模型（如GPT-4），忽略了其他LMMs的潜力，且上下文元数据与推理修饰符的交互影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过整合GPS、时间戳和食物信息等元数据，结合多种推理修饰符（如Chain-of-Thought），评估八种LMMs的性能。

Result: 实验表明，整合元数据能显著降低营养值预测的误差（MAE和MAPE）。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的LMMs在营养分析中具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to meal images for
nutrition analysis. However, existing work primarily evaluates proprietary
models, such as GPT-4. This leaves the broad range of LLMs underexplored.
Additionally, the influence of integrating contextual metadata and its
interaction with various reasoning modifiers remains largely uncharted. This
work investigates how interpreting contextual metadata derived from GPS
coordinates (converted to location/venue type), timestamps (transformed into
meal/day type), and the food items present can enhance LMM performance in
estimating key nutritional values. These values include calories,
macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fat), and portion sizes. We also
introduce ACETADA, a new food-image dataset slated for public release. This
open dataset provides nutrition information verified by the dietitian and
serves as the foundation for our analysis. Our evaluation across eight LMMs
(four open-weight and four closed-weight) first establishes the benefit of
contextual metadata integration over straightforward prompting with images
alone. We then demonstrate how this incorporation of contextual information
enhances the efficacy of reasoning modifiers, such as Chain-of-Thought,
Multimodal Chain-of-Thought, Scale Hint, Few-Shot, and Expert Persona.
Empirical results show that integrating metadata intelligently, when applied
through straightforward prompting strategies, can significantly reduce the Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in predicted
nutritional values. This work highlights the potential of context-aware LMMs
for improved nutrition analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在计算机视觉中，准确将像素测量转换为真实世界尺寸是一个基础性挑战，限制了生物医学、法医学、营养分析和电子商务等关键应用的进展。

Method: RulerNet通过统一的几何级数参数表示标尺，并使用抗扭曲的注释和训练策略直接定位厘米标记，同时提出了一种合成数据管道以增加训练多样性。

Result: 实验表明，RulerNet在复杂现实条件下提供了准确、一致且高效的尺寸估计。

Conclusion: RulerNet作为一种通用测量工具，具有与其他视觉组件集成的潜力，可用于高影响力领域的自动化、尺度感知分析。

Abstract: Accurately converting pixel measurements into absolute real-world dimensions
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and limits progress in key
applications such as biomedicine, forensics, nutritional analysis, and
e-commerce. We introduce RulerNet, a deep learning framework that robustly
infers scale "in the wild" by reformulating ruler reading as a unified
keypoint-detection problem and by representing the ruler with
geometric-progression parameters that are invariant to perspective
transformations. Unlike traditional methods that rely on handcrafted thresholds
or rigid, ruler-specific pipelines, RulerNet directly localizes centimeter
marks using a distortion-invariant annotation and training strategy, enabling
strong generalization across diverse ruler types and imaging conditions while
mitigating data scarcity. We also present a scalable synthetic-data pipeline
that combines graphics-based ruler generation with ControlNet to add
photorealistic context, greatly increasing training diversity and improving
performance. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we propose DeepGP, a
lightweight feed-forward network that regresses geometric-progression
parameters from noisy marks and eliminates iterative optimization, enabling
real-time scale estimation on mobile or edge devices. Experiments show that
RulerNet delivers accurate, consistent, and efficient scale estimates under
challenging real-world conditions. These results underscore its utility as a
generalizable measurement tool and its potential for integration with other
vision components for automated, scale-aware analysis in high-impact domains. A

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型评估方法在复杂组合生成场景中表现不佳，尤其是在处理实体-属性语义时存在属性混淆问题。

Method: 基于视觉问答（VQA）定位策略，提出了一种局部化评估协议和自动指标L-VQAScore，结合视觉定位和VQA探测正确和错误定位的属性生成。

Result: 在新构建的数据集上，L-VQAScore在与人评估的相关性上优于现有方法，能够捕捉细粒度的实体-属性关联。

Conclusion: L-VQAScore是一种可靠且可扩展的替代主观评估的方法。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
evaluation remains challenging in domains like fashion, involving complex
compositional generation. Recent automated T2I evaluation methods leverage
pre-trained vision-language models to measure cross-modal alignment. However,
our preliminary study reveals that they are still limited in assessing rich
entity-attribute semantics, facing challenges in attribute confusion, i.e.,
when attributes are correctly depicted but associated to the wrong entities. To
address this, we build on a Visual Question Answering (VQA) localization
strategy targeting one single entity at a time across both visual and textual
modalities. We propose a localized human evaluation protocol and introduce a
novel automatic metric, Localized VQAScore (L-VQAScore), that combines visual
localization with VQA probing both correct (reflection) and miss-localized
(leakage) attribute generation. On a newly curated dataset featuring
challenging compositional alignment scenarios, L-VQAScore outperforms
state-of-the-art T2I evaluation methods in terms of correlation with human
judgments, demonstrating its strength in capturing fine-grained
entity-attribute associations. We believe L-VQAScore can be a reliable and
scalable alternative to subjective evaluations.

Abstract: Generating diverse and natural human motion sequences based on textual
descriptions constitutes a fundamental and challenging research area within the
domains of computer vision, graphics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements in this field, current methodologies often face challenges
regarding zero-shot generalization capabilities, largely attributable to the
limited size of training datasets. Moreover, the lack of a comprehensive
evaluation framework impedes the advancement of this task by failing to
identify directions for improvement. In this work, we aim to push
text-to-motion into a new era, that is, to achieve the generalization ability
of zero-shot. To this end, firstly, we develop an efficient annotation pipeline
and introduce MotionMillion-the largest human motion dataset to date, featuring
over 2,000 hours and 2 million high-quality motion sequences. Additionally, we
propose MotionMillion-Eval, the most comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
zero-shot motion generation. Leveraging a scalable architecture, we scale our
model to 7B parameters and validate its performance on MotionMillion-Eval. Our
results demonstrate strong generalization to out-of-domain and complex
compositional motions, marking a significant step toward zero-shot human motion
generation. The code is available at

Conclusion: VLV框架通过高效利用预训练模型，显著降低了视觉语言模型的训练成本和数据需求，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Building state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong
captioning capabilities typically necessitates training on billions of
high-quality image-text pairs, requiring millions of GPU hours. This paper
introduces the Vision-Language-Vision (VLV) auto-encoder framework, which
strategically leverages key pretrained components: a vision encoder, the
decoder of a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model, and subsequently, a Large
Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we establish an information bottleneck by
regularizing the language representation space, achieved through freezing the
pretrained T2I diffusion decoder. Our VLV pipeline effectively distills
knowledge from the text-conditioned diffusion model using continuous
embeddings, demonstrating comprehensive semantic understanding via high-quality
reconstructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM to decode the
intermediate language representations into detailed descriptions, we construct
a state-of-the-art (SoTA) captioner comparable to leading models like GPT-4o
and Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our method demonstrates exceptional cost-efficiency and
significantly reduces data requirements; by primarily utilizing single-modal
images for training and maximizing the utility of existing pretrained models
(image encoder, T2I diffusion model, and LLM), it circumvents the need for
massive paired image-text datasets, keeping the total training expenditure
under $1,000 USD.

Abstract: We present 4KAgent, a unified agentic super-resolution generalist system
designed to universally upscale any image to 4K resolution (and even higher, if
applied iteratively). Our system can transform images from extremely low
resolutions with severe degradations, for example, highly distorted inputs at

core components: (1) Profiling, a module that customizes the 4KAgent pipeline
based on bespoke use cases; (2) A Perception Agent, which leverages
vision-language models alongside image quality assessment experts to analyze
the input image and make a tailored restoration plan; and (3) A Restoration
Agent, which executes the plan, following a recursive execution-reflection
paradigm, guided by a quality-driven mixture-of-expert policy to select the
optimal output for each step. Additionally, 4KAgent embeds a specialized face
restoration pipeline, significantly enhancing facial details in portrait and
selfie photos. We rigorously evaluate our 4KAgent across 11 distinct task
categories encompassing a total of 26 diverse benchmarks, setting new
state-of-the-art on a broad spectrum of imaging domains. Our evaluations cover
natural images, portrait photos, AI-generated content, satellite imagery,
fluorescence microscopy, and medical imaging like fundoscopy, ultrasound, and
X-ray, demonstrating superior performance in terms of both perceptual (e.g.,
NIQE, MUSIQ) and fidelity (e.g., PSNR) metrics. By establishing a novel agentic

innovation within vision-centric autonomous agents across diverse research
communities. We will release all the code, models, and results at:

Conclusion: 扩散模型可作为视觉编码器的有效补充，提升多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled
image-based question-answering capabilities. However, a key limitation is the
use of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global
information, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the
input query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware
visual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find
diffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text
alignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus
the model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to
align these features with large language models and uncover a leakage
phenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the
original diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a
mitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion
strategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We
evaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks,
demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding,
particularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional
reasoning. Our project page can be found

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了满足不同用户对模型能力与成本的需求，Gemini 2.X家族旨在覆盖从高性能到低成本的全方位选择，推动复杂代理工作流程的发展。

Method: Gemini 2.5 Pro结合了长上下文、多模态和推理能力；2.5 Flash提供高效推理；2.0 Flash和Flash-Lite则注重低延迟和低成本。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro在编码和推理基准测试中达到SoTA性能，并能处理3小时视频内容；其他模型在不同场景下也表现优异。

Conclusion: Gemini 2.X模型家族为用户提供了多样化的选择，能够在能力与成本之间找到最佳平衡，推动复杂问题的解决。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce the Gemini 2.X model family: Gemini 2.5 Pro and
Gemini 2.5 Flash, as well as our earlier Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite
models. Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most capable model yet, achieving SoTA
performance on frontier coding and reasoning benchmarks. In addition to its
incredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that
excels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours
of video content. Its unique combination of long context, multimodal and
reasoning capabilities can be combined to unlock new agentic workflows. Gemini
2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute
and latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high
performance at low latency and cost. Taken together, the Gemini 2.X model
generation spans the full Pareto frontier of model capability vs cost, allowing
users to explore the boundaries of what is possible with complex agentic
problem solving.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型在多语言环境中存在过度自信问题，导致用户过度依赖其回答，且不同语言间的依赖行为存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在多语言环境中的安全性，特别是其校准和用户依赖行为。

Method: 分析五种语言中模型生成的认知标记分布，并测量用户对不同语言中模型回答的依赖率。

Result: 模型在所有语言中均表现出过度自信，但不同语言的认知标记分布和用户依赖行为存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 多语言校准具有挑战性，需结合文化和语言背景进行模型安全性评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, it is crucial that
their responses are calibrated across languages to accurately convey
uncertainty and limitations. Previous work has shown that LLMs are
linguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident
generations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,
'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we
study the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,
and overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a
global context.
  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first
analyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that
while LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to
documented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers
of uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and
Mandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that
while users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,
reliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely
significantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.
Taken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident
model generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of
multilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and
linguistically contextualized model safety evaluations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ETT方法通过高效微调短上下文Transformer模型的参数，以线性计算开销和恒定内存需求扩展上下文长度，提升模型在长序列任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在处理长序列时面临二次计算和内存开销的问题，限制了其应用范围。

Method: ETT通过将输入上下文分块为重叠小子序列，并在测试时高效微调模型参数，实现上下文长度的扩展。

Result: 在LongBench上，ETT将GPT-Large和Phi-2的上下文长度从1k扩展到32k，准确率提升30%。

Conclusion: 微调FFN的第二层比全微调更有效，进一步提高了模型准确率。

Abstract: Transformer-based Language Models' computation and memory overhead increase
quadratically as a function of sequence length. The quadratic cost poses
challenges when employing LLMs for processing long sequences. In this work, we
introduce \ourmodelacronym~(Extend at Test-Time), method for extending the
context length of short context Transformer-based LLMs, with constant memory
requirement and linear computation overhead. ETT enable the extension of the
context length at test-time by efficient fine-tuning the model's parameters on
the input context, chunked into overlapping small subsequences. We evaluate ETT
on LongBench by extending the context length of GPT-Large and Phi-2 up to 32
times, increasing from 1k to 32k tokens. This results in up to a 30 percent
improvement in the model's accuracy. We also study how context can be stored in
LLM's weights effectively and efficiently. Through a detailed ablation study,
we examine which Transformer modules are most beneficial to fine-tune at
test-time. Interestingly, we find that fine-tuning the second layer of the FFNs
is more effective than full fine-tuning, leading to a further improvement in
the models' accuracy.

Result: 模型在交互对话环境中表现良好，为统一语义理论提供了潜在路径。

Conclusion: “词作为分类器”模型有望成为统一形式、分布和接地语义理论的有效方法。

Abstract: Formal, Distributional, and Grounded theories of computational semantics each
have their uses and their drawbacks. There has been a shift to ground models of
language by adding visual knowledge, and there has been a call to enrich models
of language with symbolic methods to gain the benefits from formal,
distributional, and grounded theories. In this paper, we attempt to make the
case that one potential path forward in unifying all three semantic fields is
paved with the words-as-classifier model, a model of word-level grounded
semantics that has been incorporated into formalisms and distributional
language models in the literature, and it has been well-tested within
interactive dialogue settings. We review that literature, motivate the
words-as-classifiers model with an appeal to recent work in cognitive science,
and describe a small experiment. Finally, we sketch a model of semantics
unified through words-as-classifiers.

TL;DR: 论文扩展了MorphScore以支持70种语言，并探讨了分词器质量与模型性能的关系，发现形态对齐对模型性能影响有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究分词器质量评估的有效性，特别是形态边界与分词边界的对齐对语言模型性能的影响。

Method: 扩展MorphScore至70种语言，改进评估灵活性，并与五种预训练语言模型在七项任务中的性能进行相关性分析。

Result: 形态对齐对模型性能的方差解释有限，表明其单独不足以衡量分词器质量对模型性能的影响。

Conclusion: 形态对齐并非衡量分词器质量的关键维度，需探索其他评估方法。

Abstract: While tokenization is a key step in language modeling, with effects on model
training and performance, it remains unclear how to effectively evaluate
tokenizer quality. One proposed dimension of tokenizer quality is the extent to
which tokenizers preserve linguistically meaningful subwords, aligning token
boundaries with morphological boundaries within a word. We expand MorphScore
(Arnett & Bergen, 2025), which previously covered 22 languages, to support a
total of 70 languages. The updated MorphScore offers more flexibility in
evaluation and addresses some of the limitations of the original version. We
then correlate our alignment scores with downstream task performance for five
pre-trained languages models on seven tasks, with at least one task in each of
the languages in our sample. We find that morphological alignment does not
explain very much variance in model performance, suggesting that morphological
alignment alone does not measure dimensions of tokenization quality relevant to
model performance.

Result: 证明了句法结构的形成可以通过彩色操作系统的规则进行过滤，并与超岩浆结构相关联。

Conclusion: 句法结构的形成和移动规则可以通过彩色操作系统和超岩浆结构统一描述。

Abstract: We show that head functions on syntactic objects extend the magma structure
to a hypermagma, with the c-command relation compatible with the magma
operation and the m-command relation with the hypermagma. We then show that the
structure of head and complement and specifier, additional modifier positions,
and the structure of phases in the Extended Projection can be formulated as a
bud generating system of a colored operad, in a form similar to the structure
of theta roles. We also show that, due to the special form of the colored
operad generators, the filtering of freely generated syntactic objects by these
coloring rules can be equivalently formulated as a filtering in the course of
structure formation via a colored Merge, which can in turn be related to the
hypermagma structure. The rules on movement by Internal Merge with respect to
phases, the Extended Projection Principle, Empty Category Principle, and Phase
Impenetrability Condition are all subsumed into the form of the colored operad
generators. Movement compatibilities between the phase structure and the theta
roles assignments can then be formulated in terms of the respective colored
operads and a transduction of colored operads.

TL;DR: PERK提出了一种参数高效的方法，通过梯度更新轻量级适配器在测试时编码长上下文，显著提升了长上下文推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有元学习方法在长上下文推理中内存消耗过高的问题，提出一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用嵌套优化循环的元训练方法，内循环将上下文编码到低秩适配器中，外循环学习如何利用适配器进行推理。

Result: 在多个长上下文推理任务中，PERK显著优于基线方法，性能提升最高达90%（小模型）和27%（大模型）。

Conclusion: PERK在训练时内存消耗较高，但在推理时比基于提示的方法更高效，且对推理复杂性、上下文长度和信息位置更鲁棒。

Abstract: Long-context reasoning requires accurately identifying relevant information
in extensive, noisy input contexts. Previous research shows that using
test-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can
effectively enable reasoning over noisy information. However, meta-learning
methods for enabling test-time learning are prohibitively memory-intensive,
preventing their application to long context settings. In this work, we propose
PERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for
learning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight
model adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization
loops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a
low-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for
the base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter
to accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long
context. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK
significantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline,
achieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models
(GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B. In
general, PERK is more robust to reasoning complexity, length extrapolation, and
the locations of relevant information in contexts. Finally, we show that while
PERK is memory-intensive during training, it scales more efficiently at
inference time than prompt-based long-context inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励模型（RM）在捕捉人类偏好以对齐大型语言模型（LLM）时，常因分布偏移或对抗扰动而失败。现有方法依赖先验知识，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出了一种不依赖偏好分布先验的方法，通过奖励引导的解码发现失败模式，并引入REFORM框架，利用对抗样本增强训练数据。

Result: 在Anthropic HH和PKU Beavertails数据集上，REFORM显著提升了鲁棒性，同时保持奖励质量，并在下游策略训练中表现良好。

Conclusion: REFORM通过自改进机制有效提升了奖励模型的鲁棒性和对齐质量，消除了虚假相关性。

Abstract: Reward modeling (RM), which captures human preferences to align large
language models (LLMs), is increasingly employed in tasks such as model
finetuning, response filtering, and ranking. However, due to the inherent
complexity of human preferences and the limited coverage of available datasets,
reward models often fail under distributional shifts or adversarial
perturbations. Existing approaches for identifying such failure modes typically
rely on prior knowledge about preference distributions or failure attributes,
limiting their practicality in real-world settings where such information is
unavailable. In this work, we propose a tractable, preference-distribution
agnostic method for discovering reward model failure modes via reward guided
controlled decoding. Building on this, we introduce REFORM, a self-improving
reward modeling framework that enhances robustness by using the reward model
itself to guide the generation of falsely scored responses. These adversarial
examples are then used to augment the training data and patch the reward
model's misaligned behavior. We evaluate REFORM on two widely used preference
datasets Anthropic Helpful Harmless (HH) and PKU Beavertails and demonstrate
that it significantly improves robustness without sacrificing reward quality.
Notably, REFORM preserves performance both in direct evaluation and in
downstream policy training, and further improves alignment quality by removing
spurious correlations.

Result: 方法显著提升了数学推理和隐喻检测等下游任务的性能。

Conclusion: LLM分解方法提高了模型的可解释性和性能，为改进LLM提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are traditionally viewed as black-box
algorithms, therefore reducing trustworthiness and obscuring potential
approaches to increasing performance on downstream tasks. In this work, we
apply an effective LLM decomposition method using a dictionary-learning
approach with sparse autoencoders. This helps extract monosemantic features
from polysemantic LLM neurons. Remarkably, our work identifies model-internal
misunderstanding, allowing the automatic reformulation of the prompts with
additional annotations to improve the interpretation by LLMs. Moreover, this
approach demonstrates a significant performance improvement in downstream
tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and metaphor detection.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于动态嵌入主题模型（DETM）的新方法，用于分析全球气候政策话语的演变，解决了传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解政策语言的演变对评估全球应对复杂挑战（如气候变化）至关重要，但传统方法效率低且难以捕捉复杂关联。

Method: 使用DETM模型分析1995至2023年UNFCCC政策决策，展示主题随时间的变化。

Result: 模型揭示了从早期关注温室气体和国际公约，到近期聚焦实施、技术合作、能力建设、融资和全球协议的转变。

Conclusion: DETM是分析全球政策话语演变的可扩展且有效的工具，未来可扩展至其他政策领域。

Abstract: Understanding how policy language evolves over time is critical for assessing
global responses to complex challenges such as climate change. Temporal
analysis helps stakeholders, including policymakers and researchers, to
evaluate past priorities, identify emerging themes, design governance
strategies, and develop mitigation measures. Traditional approaches, such as
manual thematic coding, are time-consuming and limited in capturing the
complex, interconnected nature of global policy discourse. With the increasing
relevance of unsupervised machine learning, these limitations can be addressed,
particularly under high-volume, complex, and high-dimensional data conditions.
In this work, we explore a novel approach that applies the dynamic embedded
topic model (DETM) to analyze the evolution of global climate policy discourse.
A probabilistic model designed to capture the temporal dynamics of topics over
time. We collected a corpus of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) policy decisions from 1995 to 2023, excluding 2020 due to the
postponement of COP26 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model reveals
shifts from early emphases on greenhouse gases and international conventions to
recent focuses on implementation, technical collaboration, capacity building,
finance, and global agreements. Section 3 presents the modeling pipeline,
including preprocessing, model training, and visualization of temporal word
distributions. Our results show that DETM is a scalable and effective tool for
analyzing the evolution of global policy discourse. Section 4 discusses the
implications of these findings and we concluded with future directions and
refinements to extend this approach to other policy domains.

Motivation: 当前RLVR方法在多模态任务中表现不佳，主要因视觉输入感知不足，需改进。

Method: 提出PAPO，扩展GRPO目标，加入KL散度项作为隐式感知损失，无需额外数据或模型。

Result: 在多模态基准上提升4.4%，视觉依赖任务提升8.0%，感知错误减少30.5%。

Conclusion: PAPO实现了感知与推理的深度结合，为视觉推理的强化学习框架奠定基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be a
highly effective strategy for endowing Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust
multi-step reasoning abilities. However, its design and optimizations remain
tailored to purely textual domains, resulting in suboptimal performance when
applied to multimodal reasoning tasks. In particular, we observe that a major
source of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of
visual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose Perception-Aware Policy
Optimization (PAPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that encourages
the model to learn to perceive while learning to reason, entirely from internal
supervision signals. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation,
external reward models, or proprietary models. Specifically, we introduce the
Implicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term to the GRPO
objective, which, despite its simplicity, yields significant overall
improvements (4.4%) on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more
pronounced, approaching 8.0%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also
observe a substantial reduction (30.5%) in perception errors, indicating
improved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. We conduct comprehensive analysis
of PAPO and identify a unique loss hacking issue, which we rigorously analyze
and mitigate through a Double Entropy Loss. Overall, our work introduces a
deeper integration of perception-aware supervision into RLVR learning
objectives and lays the groundwork for a new RL framework that encourages
visually grounded reasoning. Project page: https://mikewangwzhl.github.io/PAPO.

Motivation: 传统基于ISO-TimeML的系统表达能力有限，难以处理复杂时间表达式。

Method: 将时间归一化任务定义为代码生成任务，利用SCATE框架和LLM生成可执行代码，并通过数据增强生成标注数据。

Result: 实验表明，小模型在增强数据上表现优异，甚至超过LLM，实现了高效、准确且可解释的时间归一化。

Conclusion: 该方法为时间归一化提供了新的解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Time normalization is the task of converting natural language temporal
expressions into machine-readable representations. It underpins many downstream
applications in information retrieval, question answering, and clinical
decision-making. Traditional systems based on the ISO-TimeML schema limit
expressivity and struggle with complex constructs such as compositional,
event-relative, and multi-span time expressions. In this work, we introduce a
novel formulation of time normalization as a code generation task grounded in
the SCATE framework, which defines temporal semantics through symbolic and
compositional operators. We implement a fully executable SCATE Python library
and demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can generate executable SCATE
code. Leveraging this capability, we develop an automatic data augmentation
pipeline using LLMs to synthesize large-scale annotated data with code-level
validation. Our experiments show that small, locally deployable models trained
on this augmented data can achieve strong performance, outperforming even their
LLM parents and enabling practical, accurate, and interpretable time
normalization.

TL;DR: 论文研究了线性注意力机制在长序列处理中的局限性，并通过系统评估多种线性注意力模型及其混合架构，提出了优化混合模型性能的关键因素和推荐架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在处理长序列时面临二次复杂度和内存问题，线性注意力机制虽能缓解但存在召回性能不足的问题，因此需要探索混合架构中线性注意力组件的选择。

Method: 系统评估了六种线性注意力变体及其五种混合比例，训练并开源了72个模型（340M和1.3B参数），在语言建模和召回任务上进行了基准测试。

Result: 研究发现，优秀的独立线性模型在混合架构中未必表现优异；召回性能随全注意力层比例增加而显著提升，尤其在3:1比例以下。

Conclusion: 选择性门控、分层递归和可控遗忘是混合模型有效的关键，推荐使用HGRN-2或GatedDeltaNet架构，线性与全注意力比例在3:1到6:1之间。

Abstract: Transformers face quadratic complexity and memory issues with long sequences,
prompting the adoption of linear attention mechanisms using fixed-size hidden
states. However, linear models often suffer from limited recall performance,
leading to hybrid architectures that combine linear and full attention layers.
Despite extensive hybrid architecture research, the choice of linear attention
component has not been deeply explored. We systematically evaluate various
linear attention models across generations - vector recurrences to advanced
gating mechanisms - both standalone and hybridized. To enable this
comprehensive analysis, we trained and open-sourced 72 models: 36 at 340M
parameters (20B tokens) and 36 at 1.3B parameters (100B tokens), covering six
linear attention variants across five hybridization ratios. Benchmarking on
standard language modeling and recall tasks reveals that superior standalone
linear models do not necessarily excel in hybrids. While language modeling
remains stable across linear-to-full attention ratios, recall significantly
improves with increased full attention layers, particularly below a 3:1 ratio.
Our study highlights selective gating, hierarchical recurrence, and controlled
forgetting as critical for effective hybrid models. We recommend architectures
such as HGRN-2 or GatedDeltaNet with a linear-to-full ratio between 3:1 and 6:1
to achieve Transformer-level recall efficiently. Our models are open-sourced at

Conclusion: 亟需设计更鲁棒的置信度表达机制，因为即使是微小的语义保留修改也可能导致误导性置信度。

Abstract: Robust verbal confidence generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial
for the deployment of LLMs to ensure transparency, trust, and safety in
human-AI interactions across many high-stakes applications. In this paper, we
present the first comprehensive study on the robustness of verbal confidence
under adversarial attacks. We introduce a novel framework for attacking verbal
confidence scores through both perturbation and jailbreak-based methods, and
show that these attacks can significantly jeopardize verbal confidence
estimates and lead to frequent answer changes. We examine a variety of
prompting strategies, model sizes, and application domains, revealing that
current confidence elicitation methods are vulnerable and that commonly used
defence techniques are largely ineffective or counterproductive. Our findings
underscore the urgent need to design more robust mechanisms for confidence
expression in LLMs, as even subtle semantic-preserving modifications can lead
to misleading confidence in responses.

Abstract: Translating wordplay across languages presents unique challenges that have
long confounded both professional human translators and machine translation
systems. This research proposes a novel approach for translating puns from
English to French by combining state-of-the-art large language models with
specialized techniques for wordplay generation.
  Our methodology employs a three-stage approach. First, we establish a
baseline using multiple frontier large language models with feedback based on a
new contrastive learning dataset. Second, we implement a guided
chain-of-thought pipeline with combined phonetic-semantic embeddings. Third, we
implement a multi-agent generator-discriminator framework for evaluating and
regenerating puns with feedback.
  Moving beyond the limitations of literal translation, our methodology's
primary objective is to capture the linguistic creativity and humor of the
source text wordplay, rather than simply duplicating its vocabulary. Our best
runs earned first and second place in the CLEF JOKER 2025 Task 2 competition
where they were evaluated manually by expert native French speakers.
  This research addresses a gap between translation studies and computational
linguistics by implementing linguistically-informed techniques for wordplay
translation, advancing our understanding of how language models can be
leveraged to handle the complex interplay between semantic ambiguity, phonetic
similarity, and the implicit cultural and linguistic awareness needed for
successful humor.

Motivation: KV缓存的冗余性在深层中已得到验证，但浅层的缓存减少效果不足，且现有方法无法解决GQA问题。

Method: SpindleKV结合了注意力权重驱逐（深层）和代码本替换（浅层）策略，并解决了GQA问题。

Result: 实验表明，SpindleKV在减少KV缓存的同时保持了模型性能，效果优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SpindleKV为LLM推理系统提供了一种高效的KV缓存优化方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive accomplishments in
recent years. However, the increasing memory consumption of KV cache has
possessed a significant challenge to the inference system. Eviction methods
have revealed the inherent redundancy within the KV cache, demonstrating its
potential for reduction, particularly in deeper layers. However, KV cache
reduction for shallower layers has been found to be insufficient. Based on our
observation that, the KV cache exhibits a high degree of similarity. Based on
this observation, we proposed a novel KV cache reduction method, SpindleKV,
which balances both shallow and deep layers. For deep layers, we employ an
attention weight based eviction method, while for shallow layers, we apply a
codebook based replacement approach which is learnt by similarity and merging
policy. Moreover, SpindleKV addressed the Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) dilemma
faced by other attention based eviction methods. Experiments on two common
benchmarks with three different LLMs shown that SpindleKV obtained better KV
cache reduction effect compared to baseline methods, while preserving similar
or even better model performance.

Motivation: 行为金融中，LLMs与投资者从众行为决策对齐的挑战在于缺乏真实用户数据用于监督微调（SFT），而真实数据收集成本高且存在隐私风险。

Method: 提出InvestAlign框架，利用理论解决方案生成SFT数据集，而非依赖复杂场景的真实数据。开发InvestAgent，一个基于InvestAlign微调的LLM代理。

Conclusion: InvestAlign是一种有前景的方法，可解决复杂最优投资问题，并实现LLMs与投资者从众行为决策的对齐。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with investor decision-making processes
under herd behavior is a critical challenge in behavioral finance, which
grapples with a fundamental limitation: the scarcity of real-user data needed
for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While SFT can bridge the gap between LLM
outputs and human behavioral patterns, its reliance on massive authentic data
imposes substantial collection costs and privacy risks. We propose InvestAlign,
a novel framework that constructs high-quality SFT datasets by leveraging
theoretical solutions to similar and simple optimal investment problems rather
than complex scenarios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that training
LLMs with InvestAlign-generated data achieves faster parameter convergence than
using real-user data, suggesting superior learning efficiency. Furthermore, we
develop InvestAgent, an LLM agent fine-tuned with InvestAlign, which
demonstrates significantly closer alignment to real-user data than pre-SFT
models in both simple and complex investment problems. This highlights our
proposed InvestAlign as a promising approach with the potential to address
complex optimal investment problems and align LLMs with investor
decision-making processes under herd behavior. Our code is publicly available

Abstract: This paper proposes a high-quality dataset construction method for complex

performed on industrial contract texts, and GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 are used to
extract key information from the original contract data, obtaining high-quality
data annotations. Secondly, data augmentation is achieved by constructing new
texts, and GPT-3.5 generates unstructured contract texts from randomly combined
keywords, improving model robustness. Finally, the large language model is
fine-tuned based on the high-quality dataset. Experimental results show that
the model achieves excellent overall performance while ensuring high field

### [104] [The Flaws of Others: An LLM-driven Framework for Scientific Knowledge Production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06565)
*Juan B. Gutiérrez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将人类与大型语言模型（LLM）视为平等节点的网络模型，分析了四种危害（偏离真相、自我修复、新虚构、外部检测），并开发了一个数学模型和开源算法（FOO）以提高网络可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类与LLM交互中的新媒介，解决LLM在事实、逻辑或结构上的错误问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于平等节点的网络模型，分析了四种危害，并开发了数学模型和FOO算法。

Result: 网络仅由偏离和自我修复驱动时，错误率较低；加入虚构后错误率升高；引入同行评审可显著提高准确性。

Conclusion: 通过将不完美的模型连接成网络并相互监督，可以提高新媒介的可靠性。

Abstract: Large-language models turn writing into a live exchange between humans and
software. We capture this new medium with a discursive-network model that
treats people and LLMs as equal nodes and tracks how their statements
circulate. Broadening the focus from isolated hallucinations, we define
invalidation (any factual, logical, or structural breach) and show it follows
four hazards: drift from truth, self-repair, fresh fabrication, and external
detection. A general mathematical model of discursive networks is developed to
provide valuable insights: A network governed only by drift and self-repair
stabilizes at a modest error rate; adding fabrication reproduces the high rates
seen in current LLMs. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer
review shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer
review with the open-source \emph{Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm}: a
configurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a
harmoniser merges their verdicts. The takeaway is practical and cultural:
reliability in this new medium comes not from perfecting single models but from
wiring imperfect ones into networks that keep each other honest.

*Srihari K B,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合多模态知识图谱（MMKG）与生成式AI的食品领域QA框架，显著提升了性能与多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过结合结构化知识与多模态生成，提升食品问答系统的可靠性与多样性。

Method: 构建大规模MMKG，生成QA对，联合微调Meta LLaMA和Stable Diffusion，采用混合检索-生成策略。

Result: BERTScore提升16.2%，FID降低37.8%，CLIP对齐提升31.1%，图像重用准确率94.1%，合成充分性85%。

Conclusion: 结构化知识与多模态生成的结合显著提升了食品QA的可靠性与多样性。

Abstract: We propose a unified food-domain QA framework that combines a large-scale
multimodal knowledge graph (MMKG) with generative AI. Our MMKG links 13,000
recipes, 3,000 ingredients, 140,000 relations, and 14,000 images. We generate
40,000 QA pairs using 40 templates and LLaVA/DeepSeek augmentation. Joint
fine-tuning of Meta LLaMA 3.1-8B and Stable Diffusion 3.5-Large improves
BERTScore by 16.2\%, reduces FID by 37.8\%, and boosts CLIP alignment by
31.1\%. Diagnostic analyses-CLIP-based mismatch detection (35.2\% to 7.3\%) and
LLaVA-driven hallucination checks-ensure factual and visual fidelity. A hybrid
retrieval-generation strategy achieves 94.1\% accurate image reuse and 85\%
adequacy in synthesis. Our results demonstrate that structured knowledge and
multimodal generation together enhance reliability and diversity in food QA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Gated Memory Unit (GMU)的机制，用于在SSM层之间高效共享内存，并基于此构建了SambaY架构，显著提升了解码效率和长上下文性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索SSM层间表示共享的效率潜力，以提升序列建模的性能和效率。

Method: 引入GMU机制，构建SambaY架构（结合Samba和YOCO的混合解码器架构），并在跨解码器中应用GMU以共享内存状态。

Result: SambaY显著提升了解码效率，保持了线性预填充时间复杂度，并在长上下文任务中表现优异。最大模型在推理任务中性能优于基线，且解码吞吐量提升10倍。

Conclusion: GMU和SambaY架构为高效序列建模提供了新思路，展示了在大规模计算下的优越性能扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have demonstrated the effectiveness of
State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient sequence modeling. While hybrid
architectures such as Samba and the decoder-decoder architecture, YOCO, have
shown promising performance gains over Transformers, prior works have not
investigated the efficiency potential of representation sharing between SSM
layers. In this paper, we introduce the Gated Memory Unit (GMU), a simple yet
effective mechanism for efficient memory sharing across layers. We apply it to
create SambaY, a decoder-hybrid-decoder architecture that incorporates GMUs in
the cross-decoder to share memory readout states from a Samba-based
self-decoder. SambaY significantly enhances decoding efficiency, preserves
linear pre-filling time complexity, and boosts long-context performance, all
while eliminating the need for explicit positional encoding. Through extensive
scaling experiments, we demonstrate that our model exhibits a significantly
lower irreducible loss compared to a strong YOCO baseline, indicating superior
performance scalability under large-scale compute regimes. Our largest model
enhanced with Differential Attention, Phi4-mini-Flash-Reasoning, achieves
significantly better performance than Phi4-mini-Reasoning on reasoning tasks
such as Math500, AIME24/25, and GPQA Diamond without any reinforcement
learning, while delivering up to 10x higher decoding throughput on 2K-length
prompts with 32K generation length under the vLLM inference framework. We
release our training codebase on open-source data at

TL;DR: FuDoBa方法通过贝叶斯优化将LLM嵌入与领域知识结合，生成低维、任务相关的表示，提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成的高维嵌入在领域应用中过于通用或低效的问题。

Method: 结合LLM嵌入与领域知识（本地和WikiData），通过贝叶斯优化生成低维表示。

Result: 在六个数据集上表现优于或与专有LLM嵌入基线相当。

Conclusion: FuDoBa方法高效且可解释，适用于领域特定任务。

Abstract: Building on the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based
representations have dominated the document representation landscape, achieving
great performance on the document embedding benchmarks. However, the
high-dimensional, computationally expensive embeddings from LLMs tend to be
either too generic or inefficient for domain-specific applications. To address
these limitations, we introduce FuDoBa a Bayesian optimisation-based method
that integrates LLM-based embeddings with domain-specific structured knowledge,
sourced both locally and from external repositories like WikiData. This fusion
produces low-dimensional, task-relevant representations while reducing training
complexity and yielding interpretable early-fusion weights for enhanced
classification performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
six datasets in two domains, showing that when paired with robust AutoML-based
classifiers, our proposed representation learning approach performs on par
with, or surpasses, those produced solely by the proprietary LLM-based
embedding baselines.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用Claude 3.5 Sonnet进行数据提取的两种方法，发现其在简单数据上准确率高，但在复杂数据上表现不佳，建议进一步评估LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据提取阶段资源密集，研究者希望通过LLM和审查协议加速这一过程。

Method: 使用Claude 3.5 Sonnet和审查协议对10个证据源进行数据提取，并评估其性能。

Result: 简单数据提取准确率高（83.3%和100%），复杂数据准确率低（9.6%和15.8%）；总体精度>90%，但召回率和F1分数低。

Conclusion: LLM在数据提取中表现有限，需进一步评估和改进，同时建议研究者报告LLM性能。

Abstract: The data extraction stages of reviews are resource-intensive, and researchers
may seek to expediate data extraction using online (large language models) LLMs
and review protocols. Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used to trial two approaches that
used a review protocol to prompt data extraction from 10 evidence sources
included in a case study scoping review. A protocol-based approach was also
used to review extracted data. Limited performance evaluation was undertaken
which found high accuracy for the two extraction approaches (83.3% and 100%)
when extracting simple, well-defined citation details; accuracy was lower (9.6%
and 15.8%) when extracting more complex, subjective data items. Considering all
data items, both approaches had precision >90% but low recall (<25%) and F1
scores (<40%). The context of a complex scoping review, open response types and
methodological approach likely impacted performance due to missed and
misattributed data. LLM feedback considered the baseline extraction accurate
and suggested minor amendments: four of 15 (26.7%) to citation details and 8 of
38 (21.1%) to key findings data items were considered to potentially add value.
However, when repeating the process with a dataset featuring deliberate errors,
only 2 of 39 (5%) errors were detected. Review-protocol-based methods used for
expediency require more robust performance evaluation across a range of LLMs
and review contexts with comparison to conventional prompt engineering
approaches. We recommend researchers evaluate and report LLM performance if
using them similarly to conduct data extraction or review extracted data. LLM
feedback contributed to protocol adaptation and may assist future review
protocol drafting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过分析政治人物在议会演讲中的互动和情感，量化精英极化现象。

Method: 利用人工智能识别演讲中的发言者和被提及者，并评估情感温度，构建精英极化指数。

Result: 生成的指数对选举活动、政党危机等事件反应良好，可用于分析政党间的敌对程度。

Conclusion: 该方法为欧盟范围内的精英极化研究提供了基础，未来可扩展为20年的时间序列数据集。

Abstract: This project introduces a new measure of elite polarization via actor and
subject detection using artificial intelligence. I identify when politicians
mention one another in parliamentary speeches, note who is speaking and who is
being addressed, and assess the emotional temperature behind these evaluations.
This maps how elites evaluate their various out-parties, allowing us to create
an index of mutual out-party hostility, that is, elite polarization. While I
analyzed polarization data over the past four decades for the UK, and two
decades for Hungary and Italy, my approach lays the groundwork for a
twenty-year, EU-wide time-series dataset on elite polarization. I obtain the
results that can be aggregated by party and quarter. The resulting index
demonstrates a good face validity: it reacts to events such as electoral
campaigns, country- and party-level crises, and to parties losing and assuming
power.

TL;DR: CLI-RAG框架通过分层分块和双阶段检索机制，解决了临床文本生成中的非结构化和语义密度问题，显著提升了生成文本的临床相关性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床文本生成中因数据非结构化、语义密度高和上下文长度限制导致的挑战。

Method: 提出CLI-RAG框架，采用分层分块策略和双阶段检索机制（全局阶段识别相关笔记类型，局部阶段提取高价值内容）。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上，生成的结构化进度笔记平均对齐分数达87.7%，优于临床医生撰写的基线（80.7%），且在不同LLM间表现一致。

Conclusion: CLI-RAG框架有效提升了临床文本生成的质量和可靠性，适用于实际医疗场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), including zero-shot and few-shot paradigms,
have shown promising capabilities in clinical text generation. However,
real-world applications face two key challenges: (1) patient data is highly
unstructured, heterogeneous, and scattered across multiple note types and (2)
clinical notes are often long and semantically dense, making naive prompting
infeasible due to context length constraints and the risk of omitting
clinically relevant information.
  We introduce CLI-RAG (Clinically Informed Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a
domain-specific framework for structured and clinically grounded text
generation using LLMs. It incorporates a novel hierarchical chunking strategy
that respects clinical document structure and introduces a task-specific
dual-stage retrieval mechanism. The global stage identifies relevant note types
using evidence-based queries, while the local stage extracts high-value content
within those notes creating relevance at both document and section levels.
  We apply the system to generate structured progress notes for individual
hospital visits using 15 clinical note types from the MIMIC-III dataset.
Experiments show that it preserves temporal and semantic alignment across
visits, achieving an average alignment score of 87.7%, surpassing the 80.7%
baseline from real clinician-authored notes. The generated outputs also
demonstrate high consistency across LLMs, reinforcing deterministic behavior
essential for reproducibility, reliability, and clinical trust.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理确定和不确定预测时，隐藏状态的动态变化基本一致，表明不确定性不影响推理动态。通过分析11个数据集和5个模型，发现错误预测（高不确定性）和确定预测的层间概率轨迹相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs内部如何表示和处理不确定性，以检测不确定性并防止幻觉。

Method: 使用Tuned Lens（Logit Lens的变体）分析层间概率轨迹，比较确定和不确定预测的动态变化。

Result: 确定和不确定预测的层间概率轨迹高度一致，且模型能力越强可能处理不确定性的方式不同。

Conclusion: 研究质疑了简单方法检测不确定性的可行性，并展示了可解释性方法在研究不确定性影响推理中的应用。

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) internally represent and
process their predictions is central to detecting uncertainty and preventing
hallucinations. While several studies have shown that models encode uncertainty
in their hidden states, it is underexplored how this affects the way they
process such hidden states. In this work, we demonstrate that the dynamics of
output token probabilities across layers for certain and uncertain outputs are
largely aligned, revealing that uncertainty does not seem to affect inference
dynamics. Specifically, we use the Tuned Lens, a variant of the Logit Lens, to
analyze the layer-wise probability trajectories of final prediction tokens
across 11 datasets and 5 models. Using incorrect predictions as those with
higher epistemic uncertainty, our results show aligned trajectories for certain
and uncertain predictions that both observe abrupt increases in confidence at
similar layers. We balance this finding by showing evidence that more competent
models may learn to process uncertainty differently. Our findings challenge the
feasibility of leveraging simplistic methods for detecting uncertainty at
inference. More broadly, our work demonstrates how interpretability methods may
be used to investigate the way uncertainty affects inference.

Conclusion: KAConvText-MLP结合微调fastText嵌入在句子分类任务中具有优越性能，且KAN分类头增强了模型可解释性。

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Convolution
for Text (KAConvText) in sentence classification, addressing three tasks:
imbalanced binary hate speech detection, balanced multiclass news
classification, and imbalanced multiclass ethnic language identification. We
investigate various embedding configurations, comparing random to fastText
embeddings in both static and fine-tuned settings, with embedding dimensions of
100 and 300 using CBOW and Skip-gram models. Baselines include standard CNNs
and CNNs augmented with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CNN-KAN). In addition, we
investigated KAConvText with different classification heads - MLP and KAN,
where using KAN head supports enhanced interpretability. Results show that
KAConvText-MLP with fine-tuned fastText embeddings achieves the best
performance of 91.23% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9109) for hate speech detection,
92.66% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9267) for news classification, and 99.82%
accuracy (F1-score = 0.9982) for language identification.

Result: 在多种语言和三个基准数据集上的实验表明，CE-Judge优于基线模型，与GPT-4o性能相当。

Conclusion: CE-Judge是一种高效、低成本的多语言评估方法，无需训练即可实现高性能。

Abstract: Automated text evaluation has long been a central issue in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). Recently, the field has shifted toward using Large Language
Models (LLMs) as evaluators-a trend known as the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. While
promising and easily adaptable across tasks, this approach has seen limited
exploration in multilingual contexts. Existing multilingual studies often rely
on proprietary models or require extensive training data for fine-tuning,
raising concerns about cost, time, and efficiency. In this paper, we propose
Checklist Engineering based LLM-as-a-Judge (CE-Judge), a training-free
framework that uses checklist intuition for multilingual evaluation with an
open-source model. Experiments across multiple languages and three benchmark
datasets, under both pointwise and pairwise settings, show that our method
generally surpasses the baselines and performs on par with the GPT-4o model.

Motivation: 开源大语言模型（LLMs）虽为企业应用提供了机会，但许多组织缺乏部署和维护大规模模型的基础设施，因此需要研究小规模模型的适应性。

Method: 采用领域自适应持续预训练（DACP）方法，并在多种基础模型和服务领域中进行实验验证。

Result: 实验和实际评估表明，DACP方法显著提升了sLLMs在目标领域的性能，同时保持了通用能力。

Conclusion: DACP为小规模语言模型提供了一种成本高效且可扩展的企业级部署解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of open-source large language models (LLMs) has expanded
opportunities for enterprise applications; however, many organizations still
lack the infrastructure to deploy and maintain large-scale models. As a result,
small LLMs (sLLMs) have become a practical alternative, despite their inherent
performance limitations. While Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) has
been previously explored as a method for domain adaptation, its utility in
commercial applications remains under-examined. In this study, we validate the
effectiveness of applying a DACP-based recipe across diverse foundation models
and service domains. Through extensive experiments and real-world evaluations,
we demonstrate that DACP-applied sLLMs achieve substantial gains in target
domain performance while preserving general capabilities, offering a
cost-efficient and scalable solution for enterprise-level deployment.

Abstract: This paper contributes to speeding up the design and deployment of
engineering dynamical systems by proposing a strategy for exploiting domain and
expert knowledge for the automated generation of dynamical system computational
model starting from a corpus of document relevant to the dynamical system of
interest and an input document describing the specific system. This strategy is
implemented in five steps and, crucially, it uses system modeling language
diagrams (SysML) to extract accurate information about the dependencies,
attributes, and operations of components. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
strategies and Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed in specific tasks to
improve intermediate outputs of the SySML diagrams automated generation, such
as: list of key nouns; list of extracted relationships; list of key phrases and
key relationships; block attribute values; block relationships; and BDD diagram
generation. The applicability of automated SysML diagram generation is
illustrated with different case studies. The computational models of complex
dynamical systems from SysML diagrams are then obtained via code generation and
computational model generation steps. In the code generation step, NLP
strategies are used for summarization, while LLMs are used for validation only.
The proposed approach is not limited to a specific system, domain, or
computational software. The applicability of the proposed approach is shown via
an end-to-end example from text to model of a simple pendulum, showing improved
performance compared to results yielded by LLMs only.

Result: 语义熵（SE）与准确性呈强负相关，能有效指示推理质量，实现高效协作推理。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合串行和并行推理的优势，解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated progress
toward artificial general intelligence, with inference-time scaling emerging as
a key technique. Contemporary approaches leverage either sequential reasoning
(iteratively extending chains of thought) or parallel reasoning (generating
multiple solutions simultaneously) to scale inference. However, both paradigms
face fundamental limitations: sequential scaling typically relies on arbitrary
token budgets for termination, leading to inefficiency or premature cutoff;
while parallel scaling often lacks coordination among parallel branches and
requires intrusive fine-tuning to perform effectively. In light of these
challenges, we aim to design a flexible test-time collaborative inference
framework that exploits the complementary strengths of both sequential and
parallel reasoning paradigms. Towards this goal, the core challenge lies in
developing an efficient and accurate intrinsic quality metric to assess model
responses during collaborative inference, enabling dynamic control and early
termination of the reasoning trace. To address this challenge, we introduce
semantic entropy (SE), which quantifies the semantic diversity of parallel
model responses and serves as a robust indicator of reasoning quality due to
its strong negative correlation with accuracy...

Motivation: 现有方法仅基于段落个体相关性进行重排序，难以满足复杂查询（如多跳问答）的信息需求。

Method: SETR通过Chain-of-Thought推理识别查询的信息需求，并选择最优段落集合。

Result: 在多跳RAG基准测试中，SETR在答案正确性和检索质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SETR为RAG系统提供了一种高效且有效的段落选择替代方案。

Abstract: Retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) must ensure that retrieved
passages are not only individually relevant but also collectively form a
comprehensive set. Existing approaches primarily rerank top-k passages based on
their individual relevance, often failing to meet the information needs of
complex queries in multi-hop question answering. In this work, we propose a
set-wise passage selection approach and introduce SETR, which explicitly
identifies the information requirements of a query through Chain-of-Thought
reasoning and selects an optimal set of passages that collectively satisfy
those requirements. Experiments on multi-hop RAG benchmarks show that SETR
outperforms both proprietary LLM-based rerankers and open-source baselines in
terms of answer correctness and retrieval quality, providing an effective and
efficient alternative to traditional rerankers in RAG systems. The code is

implementing and maintaining AI evaluations and develop solutions including:
(1) a structured cohort management framework for scaling community
contributions, (2) statistical methodologies for optimal resampling and
cross-model comparison with uncertainty quantification, and (3) systematic
quality control processes for reproducibility. Our analysis reveals that AI
evaluation requires specialized infrastructure, statistical rigor, and
community coordination beyond traditional software development practices.

large language models (PLMs), we introduce SCoRE, a modular and cost-effective
sentence-level RE system. SCoRE enables easy PLM switching, requires no
finetuning, and adapts smoothly to diverse corpora and KGs. By combining
supervised contrastive learning with a Bayesian k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
classifier for multi-label classification, it delivers robust performance
despite the noisy annotations of distantly supervised corpora. To improve RE
evaluation, we propose two novel metrics: Correlation Structure Distance (CSD),
measuring the alignment between learned relational patterns and KG structures,
and Precision at R (P@R), assessing utility as a recommender system. We also
release Wiki20d, a benchmark dataset replicating real-world RE conditions where
only KG-derived annotations are available. Experiments on five benchmarks show
that SCoRE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing energy consumption. Further analyses reveal that increasing model
complexity, as seen in prior work, degrades performance, highlighting the
advantages of SCoRE's minimal design. Combining efficiency, modularity, and
scalability, SCoRE stands as an optimal choice for real-world RE applications.

*Ziang Ye,Yang Zhang,Wentao Shi,Xiaoyu You,Fuli Feng,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUI代理基于大视觉语言模型（LVLM）实现自动化人机交互，但存在视觉定位漏洞，易受新型后门攻击（如VisualTrap）影响，需进一步研究其安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示GUI代理视觉定位（文本计划映射到GUI元素）的漏洞，提出后门攻击可能威胁其行为安全性。

Method: 提出VisualTrap方法，通过注入毒化数据误导代理定位触发位置而非目标，验证攻击可行性。

Result: 实验显示仅需5%毒化数据即可高效劫持视觉定位，攻击具隐蔽性且可泛化至下游任务。

Conclusion: GUI代理的后门攻击风险亟待研究，需加强安全防护。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating human-machine
interactions, capable of autonomously operating personal devices (e.g., mobile
phones) or applications within the device to perform complex real-world tasks
in a human-like manner. However, their close integration with personal devices
raises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor
attacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual
grounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce
vulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack
targeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when
given correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose
VisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to
locate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets.
VisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and
does so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical
feasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can
effectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and
highly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack
can be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover,
the injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments,
e.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments.
These findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor
attack risks in GUI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体的模因快速传播需要有效检测有害内容，但传统方法因数据不足和模因动态变化而受限。

Method: MIND采用三种策略：检索相似模因提供上下文、双向洞察推导全面理解模因、多智能体辩论确保决策稳健。

Result: 在三个模因数据集上，MIND优于现有零样本方法，且在不同模型架构和参数规模下表现良好。

Conclusion: MIND为有害模因检测提供了可扩展的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of memes on social media has highlighted the urgent need
for effective approaches to detect harmful content. However, traditional
data-driven approaches struggle to detect new memes due to their evolving
nature and the lack of up-to-date annotated data. To address this issue, we
propose MIND, a multi-agent framework for zero-shot harmful meme detection that
does not rely on annotated data. MIND implements three key strategies: 1) We
retrieve similar memes from an unannotated reference set to provide contextual
information. 2) We propose a bi-directional insight derivation mechanism to
extract a comprehensive understanding of similar memes. 3) We then employ a
multi-agent debate mechanism to ensure robust decision-making through reasoned
arbitration. Extensive experiments on three meme datasets demonstrate that our
proposed framework not only outperforms existing zero-shot approaches but also
shows strong generalization across different model architectures and parameter
scales, providing a scalable solution for harmful meme detection. The code is
available at https://github.com/destroy-lonely/MIND.

Result: 多被告多罪名场景（S4）最具挑战性，不同模型表现差异显著。

Conclusion: MPMCP数据集为法律判决预测提供了新视角，多被告多罪名场景需进一步优化模型。

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction offers a compelling method to aid legal
practitioners and researchers. However, the research question remains
relatively under-explored: Should multiple defendants and charges be treated
separately in LJP? To address this, we introduce a new dataset namely
multi-person multi-charge prediction (MPMCP), and seek the answer by evaluating
the performance of several prevailing legal large language models (LLMs) on
four practical legal judgment scenarios: (S1) single defendant with a single
charge, (S2) single defendant with multiple charges, (S3) multiple defendants
with a single charge, and (S4) multiple defendants with multiple charges. We
evaluate the dataset across two LJP tasks, i.e., charge prediction and penalty
term prediction. We have conducted extensive experiments and found that the
scenario involving multiple defendants and multiple charges (S4) poses the
greatest challenges, followed by S2, S3, and S1. The impact varies
significantly depending on the model. For example, in S4 compared to S1,
InternLM2 achieves approximately 4.5% lower F1-score and 2.8% higher LogD,
while Lawformer demonstrates around 19.7% lower F1-score and 19.0% higher LogD.

Motivation: 在线学习和AI辅导的兴起使得导师策略对学生成果的影响备受关注，但预测导师策略的研究较少。

Method: 使用两个数学辅导对话数据集，测试Llama 3和GPT-4o预测导师策略和学生成果的能力。

Result: 即使最先进的LLMs也难以准确预测导师策略，但导师策略对学生成果有显著影响。

Conclusion: 需要更强大的方法来预测辅导对话中的导师策略及其对学生成果的影响。

Abstract: Tutoring dialogues have gained significant attention in recent years, given
the prominence of online learning and the emerging tutoring abilities of
artificial intelligence (AI) agents powered by large language models (LLMs).
Recent studies have shown that the strategies used by tutors can have
significant effects on student outcomes, necessitating methods to predict how
tutors will behave and how their actions impact students. However, few works
have studied predicting tutor strategy in dialogues. Therefore, in this work we
investigate the ability of modern LLMs, particularly Llama 3 and GPT-4o, to
predict both future tutor moves and student outcomes in dialogues, using two
math tutoring dialogue datasets. We find that even state-of-the-art LLMs
struggle to predict future tutor strategy while tutor strategy is highly
indicative of student outcomes, outlining a need for more powerful methods to
approach this task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码生成评估基准（如HumanEval和LiveCodeBench）的测试用例数量有限且同质化，导致性能评估不准确，影响强化学习框架中的奖励估计。

Method: 提出多维度指标量化测试套件全面性，并开发人机协作方法SAGA，结合人类编程经验和LLM推理能力生成高质量测试用例。

Result: SAGA在TCGBench上实现了90.62%的检测率和32.58%的验证准确率，其生成的基准验证准确率比LiveCodeBench-v6高10.78%。

Conclusion: SAGA为可靠的LLM代码评估提供了可扩展的基础，推动了代码生成中强化学习的进步，并为自动化对抗测试和自适应基准集成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved notable success in
code-generation benchmarks such as HumanEval and LiveCodeBench. However, a
detailed examination reveals that these evaluation suites often comprise only a
limited number of homogeneous test cases, resulting in subtle faults going
undetected. This not only artificially inflates measured performance but also
compromises accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning frameworks
utilizing verifiable rewards (RLVR). To address these critical shortcomings, we
systematically investigate the test-case generation (TCG) task by proposing
multi-dimensional metrics designed to rigorously quantify test-suite
thoroughness. Furthermore, we introduce a human-LLM collaborative method
(SAGA), leveraging human programming expertise with LLM reasoning capability,
aimed at significantly enhancing both the coverage and the quality of generated
test cases. In addition, we develop a TCGBench to facilitate the study of the
TCG task. Experiments show that SAGA achieves a detection rate of 90.62% and a
verifier accuracy of 32.58% on TCGBench. The Verifier Accuracy (Verifier Acc)
of the code generation evaluation benchmark synthesized by SAGA is 10.78%
higher than that of LiveCodeBench-v6. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method. We hope this work contributes to building
a scalable foundation for reliable LLM code evaluation, further advancing RLVR
in code generation, and paving the way for automated adversarial test synthesis
and adaptive benchmark integration.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）更新成本高且效率低，RAG通过动态引入外部知识改善事实一致性和减少幻觉，但其性能高度依赖查询质量。

Method: 分析RAG流程中各组件对不同查询扰动的敏感性，研究模块独立及端到端问答效果，使用通用和领域数据集，提出评估框架。

Result: 实验显示检索器性能在轻微查询变化下显著下降，通过1092次实验验证并提出改进建议。

Conclusion: RAG系统对查询扰动敏感，需优化检索器和评估框架以提高鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are very costly and inefficient to update with
new information. To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) has been proposed as a solution that dynamically incorporates external
knowledge during inference, improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations. Despite its promise, RAG systems face practical challenges-most
notably, a strong dependence on the quality of the input query for accurate
retrieval. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of different
components in the RAG pipeline to various types of query perturbations. Our
analysis reveals that the performance of commonly used retrievers can degrade
significantly even under minor query variations. We study each module in
isolation as well as their combined effect in an end-to-end question answering
setting, using both general-domain and domain-specific datasets. Additionally,
we propose an evaluation framework to systematically assess the query-level
robustness of RAG pipelines and offer actionable recommendations for
practitioners based on the results of more than 1092 experiments we performed.

and two domains (the Russia-Ukraine Conflict and Climate Change). It provides
an interactive web interface for media analysts to explore and compare framing
across different sources, tackling the challenge of automatically detecting and
labeling how entities are framed. Our system allows end users to focus on a
single article as well as analyze up to four articles simultaneously. We
provide aggregate level analysis including an intuitive graph visualization
that highlights the narrative a group of articles are pushing. Our system
includes a search feature for users to look up entities of interest, along with
a timeline view that allows analysts to track an entity's role transitions
across different contexts within the article. The FRaN-X system and the trained

<details>

Motivation: 解决在敏感或受保护数据环境下，数据所有者不愿共享数据但仍希望受益于联合模型训练的问题。

Method: 采用混合专家（MoE）架构，专家独立训练于封闭数据集，通过领域感知路由集成，无需联合训练。

Result: 在31个任务上表现优异，平均相对提升41%，优于现有模型合并方法10.1%。

Conclusion: FlexOlmo为受监管行业提供了一种尊重数据隐私的解决方案，支持数据本地化和细粒度访问控制。

Abstract: We introduce FlexOlmo, a new class of language models (LMs) that supports (1)
distributed training without data sharing, where different model parameters are
independently trained on closed datasets, and (2) data-flexible inference,
where these parameters along with their associated data can be flexibly
included or excluded from model inferences with no further training. FlexOlmo
employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture where each expert is trained
independently on closed datasets and later integrated through a new
domain-informed routing without any joint training. FlexOlmo is trained on
FlexMix, a corpus we curate comprising publicly available datasets alongside
seven domain-specific sets, representing realistic approximations of closed
sets. We evaluate models with up to 37 billion parameters (20 billion active)
on 31 diverse downstream tasks. We show that a general expert trained on public
data can be effectively combined with independently trained experts from other
data owners, leading to an average 41% relative improvement while allowing
users to opt out of certain data based on data licensing or permission
requirements. Our approach also outperforms prior model merging methods by
10.1% on average and surpasses the standard MoE trained without data
restrictions using the same training FLOPs. Altogether, this research presents
a solution for both data owners and researchers in regulated industries with
sensitive or protected data. FlexOlmo enables benefiting from closed data while
respecting data owners' preferences by keeping their data local and supporting
fine-grained control of data access during inference.

Conclusion: 统一模型能有效结合检索和生成任务，提升对话搜索系统的整体表现。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of conversational search systems revolutionizes how
information is accessed by enabling the multi-turn interaction between the user
and the system. Existing conversational search systems are usually built with
two different models. This separation restricts the system from leveraging the
intrinsic knowledge of the models simultaneously, which cannot ensure the
effectiveness of retrieval benefiting the generation. The existing studies for
developing unified models cannot fully address the aspects of understanding
conversational context, managing retrieval independently, and generating
responses. In this paper, we explore how to unify dense retrieval and response
generation for large language models in conversation. We conduct joint
fine-tuning with different objectives and design two mechanisms to reduce the
inconsistency risks while mitigating data discrepancy. The evaluations on five
conversational search datasets demonstrate that our unified model can mutually
improve both tasks and outperform the existing baselines.

Motivation: 探索离散扩散模型在自然语言生成中的可行性，解决连续扩散模型在离散数据（如语言）上的应用挑战。

Method: 评估离散去噪扩散概率模型（D3PM）与传统自回归模型（AR），使用Bits Per Token（BPT）、Negative Log-Likelihood（NLL）、Perplexity（PPL）和Batch Processing Speed等指标。

Result: D3PM在生成速度上表现更优（3.97批次/秒），但AR在压缩性能上更佳（平均BPT为4.59）。D3PM的平均BPT为8.05，最佳结果为5.72。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在离散数据生成中具有潜力，尤其是在并行生成方面，但仍需在生成质量上进一步改进。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models,
achieving state-of-the-art results in continuous data domains such as image and
video generation. Their core mechanism involves a forward diffusion process
that gradually transforms structured data into a Gaussian-like distribution,
followed by a learned reverse process to reconstruct the data. While successful
in continuous modalities, applying this framework to discrete data-particularly
natural language-remains challenging due to token dependency complexities and
the lack of a defined generation order.This thesis investigates the feasibility
and performance of discrete diffusion models for natural language generation.
Specifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
(D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To
assess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative
Log-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed.
  Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a
mean of 8.05. The AR model outperforms in compression with a lower mean BPT of
4.59, but D3PM achieves higher processing speed, reaching up to 3.97 batches
per sec., indicating potential for parallel generation.All evaluations were
conducted under consistent conditions-generating 100,000 tokens per model with
a fixed batch size of four-for fair comparison. This research presents a
detailed analysis of diffusion-based vs. autoregressive models, highlighting
trade-offs in generative quality and efficiency. Findings emphasize both the
promise and limitations of diffusion models for discrete data, supporting
future work in non-autoregressive language generation.

Conclusion: MEWI是医疗教育高保真训练工具的重要进步，为联合部队的医疗撤离教育和操作提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Medical evacuation is one of the United States Army's most storied and
critical mission sets, responsible for efficiently and expediently evacuating
the battlefield ill and injured. Medical evacuation planning involves designing
a robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and
treating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to
simulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline
planning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the
Medical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer
simulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and
uncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty
collection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and
evacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious
island assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road
and river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as
many casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during
didactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations
of the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical
Evacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from
student participants and external observer notes to identify key planning
decision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify
general utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially
improves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative
decision-making. MEWI is a substantial step forward in the field of
high-fidelity training tools for medical education, and our study findings
offer critical insights into improving medical evacuation education and
operations across the joint force.

Motivation: 现有提示工程框架要么隐藏复杂性，要么提供不灵活的固定模式，难以实现复杂的代理编程，因此需要一种更灵活且高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出PDL，一种声明性语言，将提示、规则代码和外部工具组合抽象化，支持手动和自动调优，并优化性能。

Result: 通过实际案例（合规代理）验证，PDL调优后的性能比固定模式提升高达4倍。

Conclusion: PDL通过声明性表示和优化能力，显著提升了提示工程的灵活性和效率。

Abstract: Prompt engineering for LLMs remains complex, with existing frameworks either
hiding complexity behind restrictive APIs or providing inflexible canned
patterns that resist customization -- making sophisticated agentic programming
challenging. We present the Prompt Declaration Language (PDL), a novel approach
to prompt representation that tackles this fundamental complexity by bringing
prompts to the forefront, enabling manual and automatic prompt tuning while
capturing the composition of LLM calls together with rule-based code and
external tools. By abstracting away the plumbing for such compositions, PDL
aims at improving programmer productivity while providing a declarative
representation that is amenable to optimization. This paper demonstrates PDL's
utility through a real-world case study of a compliance agent. Tuning the
prompting pattern of this agent yielded up to 4x performance improvement
compared to using a canned agent and prompt pattern.

framework and validate detection methodologies through Monte Carlo simulations,
while acknowledging that empirical validation awaits suitable longitudinal
data. Our analysis focuses on creating robust tools for future empirical
studies and exploring the potential implications should the hypothesis prove
valid. The study examines how factors such as shrinking idea-to-action
intervals and compounding iterative AI improvements drive this jolting pattern.
By formalizing jolt dynamics and validating detection methods through
simulation, this work provides the mathematical foundation necessary for
understanding potential AI trajectories and their consequences for AGI
emergence, offering insights for research and policy.

Result: 证明q-辩证系统比p-辩证系统更强大，p-辩证系统又比d-辩证系统更强。

Conclusion: 结果强调了反例和矛盾在自动信念修正和数学推理中的互补作用。

Abstract: Dialectical systems are a mathematical formalism for modeling an agent
updating a knowledge base seeking consistency. Introduced in the 1970s by
Roberto Magari, they were originally conceived to capture how a working
mathematician or a research community refines beliefs in the pursuit of truth.
Dialectical systems also serve as natural models for the belief change of an
automated agent, offering a unifying, computable framework for dynamic belief
management.
  The literature distinguishes three main models of dialectical systems:
(d-)dialectical systems based on revising beliefs when they are seen to be
inconsistent, p-dialectical systems based on revising beliefs based on finding
a counterexample, and q-dialectical systems which can do both. We answer an
open problem in the literature by proving that q-dialectical systems are
strictly more powerful than p-dialectical systems, which are themselves known
to be strictly stronger than (d-)dialectical systems. This result highlights
the complementary roles of counterexample and contradiction in automated belief
revision, and thus also in the reasoning processes of mathematicians and
research communities.

*Uri Andrews,Luca San Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何将SCC递归语义扩展到无限论证框架（AFs），并评估了其满足Baroni和Giacomin标准的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SCC递归语义在有限AFs中有效，但在无限AFs中存在局限性，需要扩展以适应更广泛的应用。

Method: 提出了两种扩展SCC递归语义的方法，并系统评估了其在无限和有限AFs中的表现。

Result: 发现方向性在无限AFs中普遍失败，但在有限AFs中部分语义满足方向性。

Conclusion: 研究为无限论证理论奠定了基础，支持处理无界或动态领域的推理系统。

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks (AFs) are a foundational tool in artificial
intelligence for modeling structured reasoning and conflict. SCC-recursiveness
is a well-known design principle in which the evaluation of arguments is
decomposed according to the strongly connected components (SCCs) of the attack
graph, proceeding recursively from "higher" to "lower" components. While
SCC-recursive semantics such as \cft and \stgt have proven effective for finite
AFs, Baumann and Spanring showed the failure of SCC-recursive semantics to
generalize reliably to infinite AFs due to issues with well-foundedness.
  We propose two approaches to extending SCC-recursiveness to the infinite
setting. We systematically evaluate these semantics using Baroni and Giacomin's
established criteria, showing in particular that directionality fails in
general. We then examine these semantics' behavior in finitary frameworks,
where we find some of our semantics satisfy directionality. These results
advance the theory of infinite argumentation and lay the groundwork for
reasoning systems capable of handling unbounded or evolving domains.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种系统化的指令数据构建框架，通过分层标注、种子选择、数据合成和模型诊断生成高质量指令数据，提升了模型的指令遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前指令数据集在覆盖范围和深度上存在不足，导致模型在复杂指令和罕见领域任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出包含分层标注系统、种子选择算法、进化数据合成和模型诊断的闭环框架，构建高质量指令数据集InfinityInstruct-Subject。

Result: 实验证明该数据集能有效提升模型性能，覆盖范围和深度优于同类数据集。

Conclusion: 该工作为指令数据集从数量扩张到质量提升提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Instruction tuning has become a foundation for unlocking the capabilities of
large-scale pretrained models and improving their performance on complex tasks.
Thus, the construction of high-quality instruction datasets is crucial for
enhancing model performance and generalizability. Although current instruction
datasets have reached tens of millions of samples, models finetuned on them may
still struggle with complex instruction following and tasks in rare domains.
This is primarily due to limited expansion in both ``coverage'' (coverage of
task types and knowledge areas) and ``depth'' (instruction complexity) of the
instruction set. To address this issue, we propose a systematic instruction
data construction framework, which integrates a hierarchical labeling system,
an informative seed selection algorithm, an evolutionary data synthesis
process, and a model deficiency diagnosis with targeted data generation. These
components form an iterative closed-loop to continuously enhance the coverage
and depth of instruction data. Based on this framework, we construct
InfinityInstruct-Subject, a high-quality dataset containing ~1.5 million
instructions. Experiments on multiple foundation models and benchmark tasks
demonstrate its effectiveness in improving instruction-following capabilities.
Further analyses suggest that InfinityInstruct-Subject shows enlarged coverage
and depth compared to comparable synthesized instruction datasets. Our work
lays a theoretical and practical foundation for the efficient, continuous
evolution of instruction datasets, moving from data quantity expansion to
qualitative improvement.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态旅行规划系统，通过三个协作代理解决现有系统的不足，显著提升了查询解析、导航准确性和抗干扰能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统旅行规划系统静态且碎片化，无法应对环境变化和行程中断等现实复杂性，导致用户体验不佳。

Method: 提出三个协作代理：旅行规划代理（基于网格空间定位和地图分析）、目的地助手代理（提供精细导航）和本地发现代理（利用图像嵌入和RAG技术应对行程中断）。

Result: 系统在查询解析、导航准确性和抗干扰能力方面表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: 该系统在从城市探索到应急响应等多个领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Traditional travel-planning systems are often static and fragmented, leaving
them ill-equipped to handle real-world complexities such as evolving
environmental conditions and unexpected itinerary disruptions. In this paper,
we identify three gaps between existing service providers causing frustrating
user experience: intelligent trip planning, precision "last-100-meter"
navigation, and dynamic itinerary adaptation. We propose three cooperative
agents: a Travel Planning Agent that employs grid-based spatial grounding and
map analysis to help resolve complex multi-modal user queries; a Destination
Assistant Agent that provides fine-grained guidance for the final navigation
leg of each journey; and a Local Discovery Agent that leverages image
embeddings and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to detect and respond to
trip plan disruptions. With evaluations and experiments, our system
demonstrates substantial improvements in query interpretation, navigation
accuracy, and disruption resilience, underscoring its promise for applications
from urban exploration to emergency response.

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，FR3E实现了更稳定的训练、更长的连贯回答和更高的完全正确轨迹比例。

Conclusion: FR3E通过结构化探索有效提升了LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but it struggles with unstable
exploration. We propose FR3E (First Return, Entropy-Eliciting Explore), a
structured exploration framework that identifies high-uncertainty decision
points in reasoning trajectories and performs targeted rollouts to construct
semantically grounded intermediate feedback. Our method provides targeted
guidance without relying on dense supervision. Empirical results on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks(AIME24) show that FR3E promotes more stable
training, produces longer and more coherent responses, and increases the
proportion of fully correct trajectories. These results highlight the
framework's effectiveness in improving LLM reasoning through more robust and
structured exploration.

*Li Zhou,Elvan Ceyhan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种资源受限的随机消歧路径（RDP）问题的新算法框架COLOGR，结合拉格朗日松弛和两阶段顶点消除（TPVE）方法，优化路径规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在资源受限条件下，导航代理在不确定障碍物环境中规划最优路径的问题。

Method: 将问题建模为带权约束的最短路径问题（WCSPP），提出COLOGR框架，结合拉格朗日松弛和TPVE方法，修剪不可行和次优路径。

Result: COLOGR在多种障碍物密度、传感器精度和风险模型下表现稳健，优于贪心基线，接近离线最优基准。

Conclusion: COLOGR框架在随机网络设计、移动规划和不确定性下的约束决策中具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: We study a resource-constrained variant of the Random Disambiguation Path
(RDP) problem, a generalization of the Stochastic Obstacle Scene (SOS) problem,
in which a navigating agent must reach a target in a spatial environment
populated with uncertain obstacles. Each ambiguous obstacle may be
disambiguated at a (possibly) heterogeneous resource cost, subject to a global
disambiguation budget. We formulate this constrained planning problem as a
Weight-Constrained Shortest Path Problem (WCSPP) with risk-adjusted edge costs
that incorporate probabilistic blockage and traversal penalties. To solve it,
we propose a novel algorithmic framework-COLOGR-combining Lagrangian relaxation
with a two-phase vertex elimination (TPVE) procedure. The method prunes
infeasible and suboptimal paths while provably preserving the optimal solution,
and leverages dual bounds to guide efficient search. We establish correctness,
feasibility guarantees, and surrogate optimality under mild assumptions. Our
analysis also demonstrates that COLOGR frequently achieves zero duality gap and
offers improved computational complexity over prior constrained path-planning
methods. Extensive simulation experiments validate the algorithm's robustness
across varying obstacle densities, sensor accuracies, and risk models,
consistently outperforming greedy baselines and approaching offline-optimal
benchmarks. The proposed framework is broadly applicable to stochastic network
design, mobility planning, and constrained decision-making under uncertainty.

Motivation: 水下洞穴对淡水资源管理、水下考古和水文地质学至关重要，绘制其轮廓和尺寸以及生成逼真的3D地图有助于更好地理解这一水下领域。

Result: 成功绘制了Devil's Eye洞穴系统的一段洞穴，并通过手动测量验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 低成本运动相机结合全局优化技术可有效绘制洞穴地图，并生成逼真的3D重建。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for mapping underwater caves. Underwater
caves are crucial for fresh water resource management, underwater archaeology,
and hydrogeology. Mapping the cave's outline and dimensions, as well as
creating photorealistic 3D maps, is critical for enabling a better
understanding of this underwater domain. In this paper, we present the mapping
of an underwater cave segment (the catacombs) of the Devil's Eye cave system at
Ginnie Springs, FL. We utilized a set of inexpensive action cameras in
conjunction with a dive computer to estimate the trajectories of the cameras
together with a sparse point cloud. The resulting reconstructions are utilized
to produce a one-dimensional retract of the cave passages in the form of the
average trajectory together with the boundaries (top, bottom, left, and right).
The use of the dive computer enables the observability of the z-dimension in
addition to the roll and pitch in a visual/inertial framework (SVIn2). In
addition, the keyframes generated by SVIn2 together with the estimated camera
poses for select areas are used as input to a global optimization (bundle
adjustment) framework -- COLMAP -- in order to produce a dense reconstruction
of those areas. The same cave segment is manually surveyed using the MNemo V2
instrument, providing an additional set of measurements validating the proposed
approach. It is worth noting that with the use of action cameras, the primary
components of a cave map can be constructed. Furthermore, with the utilization
of a global optimization framework guided by the results of VI-SLAM package
SVIn2, photorealistic dense 3D representations of selected areas can be
reconstructed.

Abstract: Evaluating and comparing the performance of autonomous Humanoid Robots is
challenging, as success rate metrics are difficult to reproduce and fail to
capture the complexity of robot movement trajectories, critical in Human-Robot
Interaction and Collaboration (HRIC). To address these challenges, we propose a
general evaluation framework that measures the quality of Imitation Learning
(IL) methods by focusing on trajectory performance. We devise the Neural Meta
Evaluator (NeME), a deep learning model trained to classify actions from robot
joint trajectories. NeME serves as a meta-evaluator to compare the performance
of robot control policies, enabling policy evaluation without requiring human
involvement in the loop. We validate our framework on ergoCub, a humanoid
robot, using teleoperation data and comparing IL methods tailored to the
available platform. The experimental results indicate that our method is more
aligned with the success rate obtained on the robot than baselines, offering a
reproducible, systematic, and insightful means for comparing the performance of
multimodal imitation learning approaches in complex HRI tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人控制器训练方法缺乏系统性，评估指标粗糙，无法深入了解训练方案对行为的影响。而发展心理学对婴儿行为的研究方法精细但受限于实际约束。论文旨在结合两者优势，研究机器人学习行为。

Method: 采用发展心理学方法，系统设计强化学习训练方案，并在模拟环境中测试双足机器人Cassie的行为，模拟婴儿实验环境。

Result: 研究揭示了不同训练方案对机器人行为的具体影响，并将Cassie的学习行为与婴儿行走发展进行了对比。

Conclusion: 这种跨学科的婴儿-机器人研究方法为未来系统研究复杂机器人学习行为提供了新思路。

Abstract: Typically, learned robot controllers are trained via relatively unsystematic
regimens and evaluated with coarse-grained outcome measures such as average
cumulative reward. The typical approach is useful to compare learning
algorithms but provides limited insight into the effects of different training
regimens and little understanding about the richness and complexity of learned
behaviors. Likewise, human infants and other animals are "trained" via
unsystematic regimens, but in contrast, developmental psychologists evaluate
their performance in highly-controlled experiments with fine-grained measures
such as success, speed of walking, and prospective adjustments. However, the
study of learned behavior in human infants is limited by the practical
constraints of training and testing babies. Here, we present a case study that
applies methods from developmental psychology to study the learned behavior of
the simulated bipedal robot Cassie. Following research on infant walking, we
systematically designed reinforcement learning training regimens and tested the
resulting controllers in simulated environments analogous to those used for
babies--but without the practical constraints. Results reveal new insights into
the behavioral impact of different training regimens and the development of
Cassie's learned behaviors relative to infants who are learning to walk. This
interdisciplinary baby-robot approach provides inspiration for future research
designed to systematically test effects of training on the development of
complex learned robot behaviors.

Motivation: 解决机器人执行高精度重复插入任务时面临的毫米级精度和一致性难题，尤其是螺母旋转和摩擦带来的复杂性。

Method: 采用强化学习策略和故障预测模块，将扳手姿态表示为螺母坐标系而非机器人坐标系，提升仿真到现实的迁移能力。

Result: 在仿真和现实环境中均实现高单次成功率，并在长期重复任务中保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了高精度重复插入任务的执行效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of Rhythmic Insertion Tasks (RIT), where
a robot must repeatedly perform high-precision insertions, such as screwing a
nut into a bolt with a wrench. The inherent difficulty of RIT lies in achieving
millimeter-level accuracy and maintaining consistent performance over multiple
repetitions, particularly when factors like nut rotation and friction introduce
additional complexity. We propose a sim-to-real framework that integrates a
reinforcement learning-based insertion policy with a failure forecasting
module. By representing the wrench's pose in the nut's coordinate frame rather
than the robot's frame, our approach significantly enhances sim-to-real
transferability. The insertion policy, trained in simulation, leverages
real-time 6D pose tracking to execute precise alignment, insertion, and
rotation maneuvers. Simultaneously, a neural network predicts potential
execution failures, triggering a simple recovery mechanism that lifts the
wrench and retries the insertion. Extensive experiments in both simulated and
real-world environments demonstrate that our method not only achieves a high
one-time success rate but also robustly maintains performance over long-horizon
repetitive tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, advancements in hardware have enabled quadruped robots to
operate with high power and speed, while robust locomotion control using
reinforcement learning (RL) has also been realized. As a result, expectations
are rising for the automation of tasks such as material transport and
exploration in unknown environments. However, autonomous locomotion in rough
terrains with significant height variations requires vertical movement, and
robots capable of performing such movements stably, along with their control
methods, have not yet been fully established. In this study, we developed the
quadruped robot KLEIYN, which features a waist joint, and aimed to expand
quadruped locomotion by enabling chimney climbing through RL. To facilitate the
learning of vertical motion, we introduced Contact-Guided Curriculum Learning
(CGCL). As a result, KLEIYN successfully climbed walls ranging from 800 mm to
1000 mm in width at an average speed of 150 mm/s, 50 times faster than
conventional robots. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the introduction of a
waist joint improves climbing performance, particularly enhancing tracking
ability on narrow walls.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as versatile tools across
various sectors, driven by their mobility and adaptability. This paper
introduces SkyVLN, a novel framework integrating vision-and-language navigation
(VLN) with Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) to enhance UAV autonomy in
complex urban environments. Unlike traditional navigation methods, SkyVLN
leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret natural language
instructions and visual observations, enabling UAVs to navigate through dynamic
3D spaces with improved accuracy and robustness. We present a multimodal
navigation agent equipped with a fine-grained spatial verbalizer and a history
path memory mechanism. These components allow the UAV to disambiguate spatial
contexts, handle ambiguous instructions, and backtrack when necessary. The
framework also incorporates an NMPC module for dynamic obstacle avoidance,
ensuring precise trajectory tracking and collision prevention. To validate our
approach, we developed a high-fidelity 3D urban simulation environment using
AirSim, featuring realistic imagery and dynamic urban elements. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SkyVLN significantly improves navigation success
rates and efficiency, particularly in new and unseen environments.

Abstract: Our Robust, Explainable Autonomy for Scientific Icy Moon Operations (REASIMO)
effort contributes to NASA's Concepts for Ocean worlds Life Detection
Technology (COLDTech) program, which explores science platform technologies for
ocean worlds such as Europa and Enceladus. Ocean world missions pose
significant operational challenges. These include long communication lags,
limited power, and lifetime limitations caused by radiation damage and hostile
conditions. Given these operational limitations, onboard autonomy will be vital
for future Ocean world missions. Besides the management of nominal lander
operations, onboard autonomy must react appropriately in the event of
anomalies. Traditional spacecraft rely on a transition into 'safe-mode' in
which non-essential components and subsystems are powered off to preserve
safety and maintain communication with Earth. For a severely time-limited Ocean
world mission, resolutions to these anomalies that can be executed without
Earth-in-the-loop communication and associated delays are paramount for
completion of the mission objectives and science goals. To address these
challenges, the REASIMO effort aims to demonstrate a robust level of
AI-assisted autonomy for such missions, including the ability to detect and
recover from anomalies, and to perform missions based on pre-trained behaviors
rather than hard-coded, predetermined logic like all prior space missions. We
developed an AI-assisted, personality-driven, intelligent framework for control
of an Ocean world mission by combining a mix of advanced technologies. To
demonstrate the capabilities of the framework, we perform tests of autonomous
sampling operations on a lander-manipulator testbed at the NASA Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, approximating possible surface conditions such a mission might
encounter.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度强化学习的Episodic RRT（ERRT）方法，通过多步探索替代随机采样，显著提高了运动规划的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于采样的运动规划方法（如RRT）在高维或复杂环境中效率低下，主要依赖随机采样导致探索方向不明确。

Method: ERRT利用深度强化学习（DRL）生成多步探索片段，将随机采样替换为有向探索，减少碰撞检测并提高路径连通性。

Result: 在2D、3D和6D环境中，ERRT及其变体显著优于传统RRT，6D机械臂场景中成功率从19%提升至98%，速度提高107倍，碰撞检测减少99.6%。

Conclusion: ERRT通过有向探索显著提升了运动规划的效率，其变体ERRT*在优化路径方面表现更优，为高维复杂环境提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Classical sampling-based motion planners like the RRTs suffer from
inefficiencies, particularly in cluttered or high-dimensional spaces, due to
their reliance on undirected, random sampling. This paper introduces the
Episodic RRT, a novel hybrid planning framework that replaces the primitive of
a random point with a learned, multi-step "exploratory episode" generated by a
Deep Reinforcement Learning agent. By making the DRL agent the engine of
exploration, ERRT transforms the search process from a diffuse, volumetric
expansion into a directed, branch-like growth. This paradigm shift yields key
advantages: it counters the curse of dimensionality with focused exploration,
minimizes expensive collision checks by proactively proposing locally valid
paths, and improves connectivity by generating inherently connected path
segments. We demonstrate through extensive empirical evaluation across 2D, 3D,
and 6D environments that ERRT and its variants consistently and significantly
outperform their classical counterparts. In a challenging 6D robotic arm
scenario, ERRT achieves a 98% success rate compared to 19% for RRT, is up to
107x faster, reduces collision checks by over 99.6%, and finds initial paths
that are nearly 50% shorter. Furthermore, its asymptotically optimal variant,
ERRT*, demonstrates vastly superior anytime performance, refining solutions to
near-optimality up to 29x faster than standard RRT* in 3D environments. Code:

Motivation: 解决深度强化学习在连续控制任务中数据需求大、长时规划复杂、安全性不足的问题，同时避免MPC的局部最优和成本函数设计困难。

Method: 集成贝叶斯MPC与actor-critic强化学习，利用SVGD优化控制序列，直接以Q值为目标。

Result: 在2D导航和机器人操作任务中，Q-STAC表现出更高的样本效率、鲁棒性和最优性。

Conclusion: Q-STAC成功结合了MPC的可解释性与强化学习的表达能力，同时提升了性能与安全性。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has shown remarkable success in continuous
control tasks, yet often requires extensive training data, struggles with
complex, long-horizon planning, and fails to maintain safety constraints during
operation. Meanwhile, Model Predictive Control (MPC) offers explainability and
constraint satisfaction, but typically yields only locally optimal solutions
and demands careful cost function design. This paper introduces the Q-guided
STein variational model predictive Actor-Critic (Q-STAC), a novel framework
that bridges these approaches by integrating Bayesian MPC with actor-critic
reinforcement learning through constrained Stein Variational Gradient Descent
(SVGD). Our method optimizes control sequences directly using learned Q-values
as objectives, eliminating the need for explicit cost function design while
leveraging known system dynamics to enhance sample efficiency and ensure
control signals remain within safe boundaries. Extensive experiments on 2D
navigation and robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that Q-STAC achieves
superior sample efficiency, robustness, and optimality compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, while maintaining the high expressiveness of
policy distributions. Experiment videos are available on our website:

Abstract: Multi-task multi-agent reinforcement learning (MT-MARL) has recently gained
attention for its potential to enhance MARL's adaptability across multiple
tasks. However, it is challenging for existing multi-task learning methods to
handle complex problems, as they are unable to handle unrelated tasks and
possess limited knowledge transfer capabilities. In this paper, we propose a
hierarchical approach that efficiently addresses these challenges. The
high-level module utilizes a skill graph, while the low-level module employs a
standard MARL algorithm. Our approach offers two contributions. First, we
consider the MT-MARL problem in the context of unrelated tasks, expanding the
scope of MTRL. Second, the skill graph is used as the upper layer of the
standard hierarchical approach, with training independent of the lower layer,
effectively handling unrelated tasks and enhancing knowledge transfer
capabilities. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate these advantages
and demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the latest hierarchical
MAPPO algorithms. Videos and code are available at

Method: 通过假设驱动的人体实验，在模拟救援场景中研究情感状态、信任和机器人行为对感知安全的影响，并引入参数ρ捕捉个体差异。

Conclusion: 研究强调了整合心理和行为维度的自适应、以人为本的安全模型的重要性，为安全关键领域的人机交互提供了更可信和有效的途径。

Abstract: Ensuring safety in human-robot interaction (HRI) is essential to foster user
trust and enable the broader adoption of robotic systems. Traditional safety
models primarily rely on sensor-based measures, such as relative distance and
velocity, to assess physical safety. However, these models often fail to
capture subjective safety perceptions, which are shaped by individual traits
and contextual factors. In this paper, we introduce and analyze a parameterized
general safety model that bridges the gap between physical and perceived safety
by incorporating a personalization parameter, $\rho$, into the safety
measurement framework to account for individual differences in safety
perception. Through a series of hypothesis-driven human-subject studies in a
simulated rescue scenario, we investigate how emotional state, trust, and robot
behavior influence perceived safety. Our results show that $\rho$ effectively
captures meaningful individual differences, driven by affective responses,
trust in task consistency, and clustering into distinct user types.
Specifically, our findings confirm that predictable and consistent robot
behavior as well as the elicitation of positive emotional states, significantly
enhance perceived safety. Moreover, responses cluster into a small number of
user types, supporting adaptive personalization based on shared safety models.
Notably, participant role significantly shapes safety perception, and repeated
exposure reduces perceived safety for participants in the casualty role,
emphasizing the impact of physical interaction and experiential change. These
findings highlight the importance of adaptive, human-centered safety models
that integrate both psychological and behavioral dimensions, offering a pathway
toward more trustworthy and effective HRI in safety-critical domains.

*Zhenyang Liu,Yikai Wang,Kuanning Wang,Longfei Liang,Xiangyang Xue,Yanwei Fu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为4D Diffusion Policy (DP4)的新方法，通过引入时空感知改进视觉模仿学习，显著提升了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉模仿学习方法依赖历史轨迹的行为克隆，缺乏3D空间和4D时空感知能力，限制了实际应用效果。

Method: DP4利用动态高斯世界模型从交互环境中学习3D空间和4D时空感知，通过单视角RGB-D观测构建当前3D场景并预测未来场景，优化轨迹生成。

Result: 在17个仿真任务和3个真实机器人任务中，DP4平均任务成功率分别提升16.4%、14%、6.45%和8.6%。

Conclusion: DP4通过增强时空感知能力，显著提升了视觉模仿学习的性能，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Visual imitation learning is effective for robots to learn versatile tasks.
However, many existing methods rely on behavior cloning with supervised
historical trajectories, limiting their 3D spatial and 4D spatiotemporal
awareness. Consequently, these methods struggle to capture the 3D structures
and 4D spatiotemporal relationships necessary for real-world deployment. In
this work, we propose 4D Diffusion Policy (DP4), a novel visual imitation
learning method that incorporates spatiotemporal awareness into diffusion-based
policies. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on trajectory cloning, DP4
leverages a dynamic Gaussian world model to guide the learning of 3D spatial
and 4D spatiotemporal perceptions from interactive environments. Our method
constructs the current 3D scene from a single-view RGB-D observation and
predicts the future 3D scene, optimizing trajectory generation by explicitly
modeling both spatial and temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments across
17 simulation tasks with 173 variants and 3 real-world robotic tasks
demonstrate that the 4D Diffusion Policy (DP4) outperforms baseline methods,
improving the average simulation task success rate by 16.4% (Adroit), 14%
(DexArt), and 6.45% (RLBench), and the average real-world robotic task success
rate by 8.6%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在复杂长距离导航任务中难以整合开放世界物体检测和高级任务规划的局限性。

Result: 成功完成涉及实时检测、搜索和导航的长序列任务，并在多种机器人上验证兼容性。

Conclusion: LOVON在动态环境中表现出高效的长距离导航和任务完成能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Object navigation in open-world environments remains a formidable and
pervasive challenge for robotic systems, particularly when it comes to
executing long-horizon tasks that require both open-world object detection and
high-level task planning. Traditional methods often struggle to integrate these
components effectively, and this limits their capability to deal with complex,
long-range navigation missions. In this paper, we propose LOVON, a novel
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) for hierarchical task
planning with open-vocabulary visual detection models, tailored for effective
long-range object navigation in dynamic, unstructured environments. To tackle
real-world challenges including visual jittering, blind zones, and temporary
target loss, we design dedicated solutions such as Laplacian Variance Filtering
for visual stabilization. We also develop a functional execution logic for the
robot that guarantees LOVON's capabilities in autonomous navigation, task
adaptation, and robust task completion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the
successful completion of long-sequence tasks involving real-time detection,
search, and navigation toward open-vocabulary dynamic targets. Furthermore,
real-world experiments across different legged robots (Unitree Go2, B2, and
H1-2) showcase the compatibility and appealing plug-and-play feature of LOVON.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定位精度和通信效率上显著优于传统方法，尤其在对抗环境中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了多机器人系统的可扩展性、可靠性和容错性，适用于大规模实际部署。

Abstract: In multi-robot systems (MRS), cooperative localization is a crucial task for
enhancing system robustness and scalability, especially in GPS-denied or
communication-limited environments. However, adversarial attacks, such as
sensor manipulation, and communication jamming, pose significant challenges to
the performance of traditional localization methods. In this paper, we propose
a novel distributed fault-tolerant cooperative localization framework to
enhance resilience against sensor and communication disruptions in adversarial
environments. We introduce an adaptive event-triggered communication strategy
that dynamically adjusts communication thresholds based on real-time sensing
and communication quality. This strategy ensures optimal performance even in
the presence of sensor degradation or communication failure. Furthermore, we
conduct a rigorous analysis of the convergence and stability properties of the
proposed algorithm, demonstrating its resilience against bounded adversarial
zones and maintaining accurate state estimation. Robotarium-based experiment
results show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms traditional
methods in terms of localization accuracy and communication efficiency,
particularly in adversarial settings. Our approach offers improved scalability,
reliability, and fault tolerance for MRS, making it suitable for large-scale
deployments in real-world, challenging environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在复杂、部分观测环境中避障的问题，特别是在处理快速加速障碍物时的局限性。

Method: 结合涡流面板法（VPM）和基于高阶控制屏障函数（HOCBF）的模型预测控制器（MPC），利用最小包围椭圆（MBE）和自适应卡尔曼滤波（AKF）处理障碍物动态。

Result: 通过仿真和实时实验验证了系统在避障和导航中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该系统能够有效处理复杂环境中的避障问题，特别是在动态障碍物场景下表现优异。

Abstract: This article presents a novel stream function-based navigational control
system for obstacle avoidance, where obstacles are represented as
two-dimensional (2D) rigid surfaces in inviscid, incompressible flows. The
approach leverages the vortex panel method (VPM) and incorporates safety
margins to control the stream function and flow properties around virtual
surfaces, enabling navigation in complex, partially observed environments using
real-time sensing. To address the limitations of the VPM in managing relative
distance and avoiding rapidly accelerating obstacles at close proximity, the
system integrates a model predictive controller (MPC) based on higher-order
control barrier functions (HOCBF). This integration incorporates VPM trajectory
generation, state estimation, and constraint handling into a receding-horizon
optimization problem. The 2D rigid surfaces are enclosed using minimum bounding
ellipses (MBEs), while an adaptive Kalman filter (AKF) captures and predicts
obstacle dynamics, propagating these estimates into the MPC-HOCBF for rapid
avoidance maneuvers. Evaluation is conducted using a PX4-powered Clover drone
Gazebo simulator and real-time experiments involving a COEX Clover quadcopter
equipped with a 360 degree LiDAR sensor.

Result: 机器人成功操控镊子工具抓取不同形状和大小的物体，成功率70.8%。

Conclusion: 强化学习在提升机器人对铰接工具的灵巧操控方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Manipulating articulated tools, such as tweezers or scissors, has rarely been
explored in previous research. Unlike rigid tools, articulated tools change
their shape dynamically, creating unique challenges for dexterous robotic
hands. In this work, we present a hierarchical, goal-conditioned reinforcement
learning (GCRL) framework to improve the manipulation capabilities of
anthropomorphic robotic hands using articulated tools. Our framework comprises
two policy layers: (1) a low-level policy that enables the dexterous hand to
manipulate the tool into various configurations for objects of different sizes,
and (2) a high-level policy that defines the tool's goal state and controls the
robotic arm for object-picking tasks. We employ an encoder, trained on
synthetic pointclouds, to estimate the tool's affordance states--specifically,
how different tool configurations (e.g., tweezer opening angles) enable
grasping of objects of varying sizes--from input point clouds, thereby enabling
precise tool manipulation. We also utilize a privilege-informed heuristic
policy to generate replay buffer, improving the training efficiency of the
high-level policy. We validate our approach through real-world experiments,
showing that the robot can effectively manipulate a tweezer-like tool to grasp
objects of diverse shapes and sizes with a 70.8 % success rate. This study
highlights the potential of RL to advance dexterous robotic manipulation of
articulated tools.

Result: 在Unitree G1机器人上验证，ULC相比分层方法具有更好的跟踪性能和更大的工作范围。

Conclusion: 统一控制策略在复杂任务中表现出色，无需牺牲性能即可实现全身协调控制。

Abstract: Loco-Manipulation for humanoid robots aims to enable robots to integrate
mobility with upper-body tracking capabilities. Most existing approaches adopt
hierarchical architectures that decompose control into isolated upper-body
(manipulation) and lower-body (locomotion) policies. While this decomposition
reduces training complexity, it inherently limits coordination between
subsystems and contradicts the unified whole-body control exhibited by humans.
We demonstrate that a single unified policy can achieve a combination of
tracking accuracy, large workspace, and robustness for humanoid
loco-manipulation. We propose the Unified Loco-Manipulation Controller (ULC), a
single-policy framework that simultaneously tracks root velocity, root height,
torso rotation, and dual-arm joint positions in an end-to-end manner, proving
the feasibility of unified control without sacrificing performance. We achieve
this unified control through key technologies: sequence skill acquisition for
progressive learning complexity, residual action modeling for fine-grained
control adjustments, command polynomial interpolation for smooth motion
transitions, random delay release for robustness to deploy variations, load
randomization for generalization to external disturbances, and
center-of-gravity tracking for providing explicit policy gradients to maintain
stability. We validate our method on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot with 3-DOF
(degrees-of-freedom) waist. Compared with strong baselines, ULC shows better
tracking performance to disentangled methods and demonstrating larger workspace
coverage. The unified dual-arm tracking enables precise manipulation under
external loads while maintaining coordinated whole-body control for complex
loco-manipulation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IPP算法采用均匀覆盖模式，但在异常集群场景下效果不佳，需优先探索异常区域。

Method: 结合均匀采样（boustrophedon）和强化学习驱动的异常集群探索（bounom=odes）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于多个基线算法。

Conclusion: bounom=odes算法在异常集群场景下更高效，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: A common class of algorithms for informative path planning (IPP) follows
boustrophedon ("as the ox turns") patterns, which aim to achieve uniform area
coverage. However, IPP is often applied in scenarios where anomalies, such as
plant diseases, pollution, or hurricane damage, appear in clusters. In such
cases, prioritizing the exploration of anomalous regions over uniform coverage
is beneficial. This work introduces a class of algorithms referred to as
bounom\=odes ("as the ox grazes"), which alternates between uniform
boustrophedon sampling and targeted exploration of detected anomaly clusters.
While uniform sampling can be designed using geometric principles, close
exploration of clusters depends on the spatial distribution of anomalies and
must be learned. In our implementation, the close exploration behavior is
learned using deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms several established
baselines.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的方法3D-Generalist，利用视觉语言模型生成高质量的3D环境作为训练数据，提升基础模型的空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏基于3D世界的数据，提升模型的空间推理能力具有挑战性，而人工创建3D环境成本高昂。

Method: 将3D环境构建视为顺序决策问题，使用视觉语言模型作为策略生成布局、材质、光照等，并通过自改进微调优化生成结果。

Result: 3D-Generalist能生成仿真就绪的3D环境，其生成的数据预训练视觉基础模型后，在下游任务中表现优于人工合成数据，接近真实数据效果。

Conclusion: 3D-Generalist为生成高质量3D训练数据提供了可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了模型的空间推理能力。

Abstract: Despite large-scale pretraining endowing models with language and vision
reasoning capabilities, improving their spatial reasoning capability remains
challenging due to the lack of data grounded in the 3D world. While it is
possible for humans to manually create immersive and interactive worlds through
3D graphics, as seen in applications such as VR, gaming, and robotics, this
process remains highly labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a scalable
method for generating high-quality 3D environments that can serve as training
data for foundation models. We recast 3D environment building as a sequential
decision-making problem, employing Vision-Language-Models (VLMs) as policies
that output actions to jointly craft a 3D environment's layout, materials,
lighting, and assets. Our proposed framework, 3D-Generalist, trains VLMs to
generate more prompt-aligned 3D environments via self-improvement fine-tuning.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D-Generalist and the proposed training
strategy in generating simulation-ready 3D environments. Furthermore, we
demonstrate its quality and scalability in synthetic data generation by
pretraining a vision foundation model on the generated data. After fine-tuning
the pre-trained model on downstream tasks, we show that it surpasses models
pre-trained on meticulously human-crafted synthetic data and approaches results
achieved with real data orders of magnitude larger.

Result: SIREN（4.9k参数）压缩率达40%，重建图像质量高（PSNR=34.54dB）；TAESD（2.2M参数）表现不佳。

Conclusion: INRs（如SIREN）在相位全息图压缩中更有效，预训练VAEs需任务适配。

Abstract: We evaluate the performance of four common learned models utilizing INR and
VAE structures for compressing phase-only holograms in holographic displays.
The evaluated models include a vanilla MLP, SIREN, and FilmSIREN, with TAESD as
the representative VAE model. Our experiments reveal that a pretrained image
VAE, TAESD, with 2.2M parameters struggles with phase-only hologram
compression, revealing the need for task-specific adaptations. Among the INRs,
SIREN with 4.9k parameters achieves %40 compression with high quality in the
reconstructed 3D images (PSNR = 34.54 dB). These results emphasize the
effectiveness of INRs and identify the limitations of pretrained image
compression VAEs for hologram compression task.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了Dota 2玩家通过降低视觉质量以提高游戏性能的实践，发现玩家确实会关闭VSYNC以减少延迟，但可能导致视觉撕裂。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏对玩家如何在实践中管理视觉与性能权衡的研究，填补这一空白。

Method: 通过调查收集Dota 2玩家的游戏配置数据和主观意图。

Result: 玩家倾向于关闭VSYNC以减少延迟，主观意图与配置行为一致。

Conclusion: 初步研究为未来更严格的调查奠定基础，有助于新玩家适应游戏、研究视觉与性能权衡，并指导开发者设计低视觉配置。

Abstract: Esports athletes often reduce visual quality to improve latency and frame
rate, and increase their in-game performance. Little research has examined the
effects of this visuo-spatial tradeoff on performance, but we could find no
work studying how players manage this tradeoff in practice. This paper is an
initial examination of this question in the game Dota 2. First, we gather the
game configuration data of Dota 2 players in a small survey. We learn that
players do limit visual detail, particularly by turning off VSYNC, which
removes rendering/display synchronization delay but permits visual "tearing".
Second, we survey the intent of those same players with a few subjective
questions. Player intent matches configuration practice. While our sampling of
Dota 2 players may not be representative, our survey does reveal suggestive
trends that lay the groundwork for future, more rigorous and larger surveys.
Such surveys can help new players adapt to the game more quickly, encourage
researchers to investigate the relative importance of temporal and visual
detail, and justify design effort by developers in "low visual" game
configurations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯泼溅虽能实现快速实时辐射场渲染，但其后编辑功能和对大规模非刚性变形的支持有限。

Method: 通过将高斯核直接嵌入显式网格表面，利用网格的拓扑和几何先验指导直观编辑操作（如移动、缩放、旋转）和复杂变形（如弯曲和拉伸）。

Result: 实现了更灵活的3D内容创作流程。

Conclusion: 为虚拟现实、角色动画和交互设计等应用提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that enhances non-rigid 3D model deformations by
bridging mesh representations with 3D Gaussian splatting. While traditional
Gaussian splatting delivers fast, real-time radiance-field rendering, its
post-editing capabilities and support for large-scale, non-rigid deformations
remain limited. Our method addresses these challenges by embedding Gaussian
kernels directly onto explicit mesh surfaces. This allows the mesh's inherent
topological and geometric priors to guide intuitive editing operations -- such
as moving, scaling, and rotating individual 3D components -- and enables
complex deformations like bending and stretching. This work paves the way for
more flexible 3D content-creation workflows in applications spanning virtual
reality, character animation, and interactive design.
