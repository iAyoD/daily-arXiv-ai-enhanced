TL;DR: Fd-CycleGAN通过结合局部邻域编码和频率感知监督，改进了CycleGAN的潜在表示学习，提升了图像翻译的感知质量和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强潜在表示学习以逼近真实数据分布，解决图像翻译任务中的局部语义和结构一致性问题。

Conclusion: 频率引导的潜在学习显著提升了图像翻译任务的泛化能力，适用于文档修复、艺术风格迁移和医学图像合成等领域。

Abstract: This paper presents Fd-CycleGAN, an image-to-image (I2I) translation
framework that enhances latent representation learning to approximate real data
distributions. Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach
integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to
capture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural
coherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics,
including KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly
quantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both
spatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we
conduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a
synthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and
other state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual
quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in
low-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution
characteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically
consistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent
learning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with
promising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and
medical image synthesis. We also provide comparative insights with
diffusion-based generative models, highlighting the advantages of our
lightweight adversarial approach in terms of training efficiency and
qualitative output.

Abstract: Recently, a significant improvement in the accuracy of 3D human pose
estimation has been achieved by combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
with pyramid grid alignment feedback loops. Additionally, innovative
breakthroughs have been made in the field of computer vision through the
adoption of Transformer-based temporal analysis architectures. Given these

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端方法依赖稀缺的成对服装数据集，且未能充分利用预训练视觉模型和测试输入的先验知识，导致在无约束场景中效果不佳。

Method: 第一阶段通过多帧试穿模型和视觉语言模型（VLM）生成高质量关键帧试穿图像；第二阶段结合骨架图、运动描述和关键帧图像，利用增强的视频生成模型确保时间一致性。

Conclusion: DreamVVT通过两阶段设计和预训练模型的有效利用，显著提升了VVT技术在真实场景中的表现。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on (VVT) technology has garnered considerable academic
interest owing to its promising applications in e-commerce advertising and
entertainment. However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce
paired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of
advanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to
accurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal
consistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
DreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired
human-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further
leverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the
first stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a
multi-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to
synthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.
These images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video
generation. \textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with
fine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input
content, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a
pretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures
long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible
dynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content
and temporal stability in real-world scenarios. Our project page

### [5] [Elucidating the Role of Feature Normalization in IJEPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02829)
*Adam Colton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出在IJEPA架构中用DynTanh激活替代层归一化（LN），以保留视觉标记的自然能量层级，从而提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 层归一化破坏了视觉标记的能量层级，导致语义重要区域无法被优先处理，同时引入棋盘状伪影。

Method: 用DynTanh激活替代层归一化，保留标记能量差异，使高能量标记对预测损失贡献更大。

Result: 改进后模型在ImageNet线性探测准确率从38%提升至42.7%，NYU Depth V2深度估计RMSE降低0.08。

Conclusion: 保留标记自然能量对自监督视觉表示学习至关重要。

Abstract: In the standard image joint embedding predictive architecture (IJEPA),
features at the output of the teacher encoder are layer normalized (LN) before
serving as a distillation target for the student encoder and predictor. We
propose that this feature normalization disrupts the natural energy hierarchy
of visual tokens, where high-energy tokens (those with larger L2 norms) encode
semantically important image regions. LN forces all features to have identical
L2 norms, effectively equalizing their energies and preventing the model from
prioritizing semantically rich regions. We find that IJEPA models trained with
feature LN exhibit loss maps with significant checkerboard-like artifacts. We
propose that feature LN be replaced with a DynTanh activation as the latter
better preserves token energies and allows high-energy tokens to greater
contribute to the prediction loss. We show that IJEPA trained with feature
DynTanh exhibits a longer-tailed loss distribution and fixes the checkerboard
artifacts in the loss map. Our empirical results show that our simple
modification improves ImageNet linear probe accuracy from 38% to 42.7% for
ViT-Small and reduces RMSE by 0.08 on NYU Depth V2 monocular depth estimation.
These results suggest that preserving natural token energies is crucial for
effective self-supervised visual representation learning.

### [6] [GENIE: Gaussian Encoding for Neural Radiance Fields Interactive Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02831)
*Mikołaj Zieliński,Krzysztof Byrski,Tomasz Szczepanik,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENIE结合了NeRF的高保真渲染和GS的可编辑性，通过高斯特征嵌入和高效搜索实现实时编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF的隐式编码难以编辑，而GS的显式结构适合交互。GENIE旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: 使用高斯特征嵌入和RT-GPS搜索技术，结合多分辨率哈希网格，实现高效编辑和渲染。

Result: GENIE支持实时编辑和动态交互，同时保持高保真渲染质量。

Conclusion: GENIE成功结合了隐式和显式表示的优点，为场景编辑和物理模拟提供了新工具。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) have recently
transformed 3D scene representation and rendering. NeRF achieves high-fidelity
novel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural
networks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction
challenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of
Gaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more
intuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly
well-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based
simulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural
Radiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the
photorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured
representation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance
modeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These
embeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest
Gaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we
introduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest
Gaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a
multi-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features.
Together, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as
Gaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence
is immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of
implicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene
manipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation,
bridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering. The code

### [7] [RefineSeg: Dual Coarse-to-Fine Learning for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02844)
*Anghong Du,Nay Aung,Theodoros N. Arvanitis,Stefan K. Piechnik,Joao A C Lima,Steffen E. Petersen,Le Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于粗标注的医学图像分割框架，通过联合训练和矩阵建模逐步逼近精确标注，性能接近全监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的高质量像素级标注成本高且需专业知识，粗标注虽易获取但噪声多，需解决这一问题。

Method: 引入转移矩阵建模粗标注中的不准确和不完整区域，通过联合训练逐步优化网络输出，推断真实分割分布。

Result: 在ACDC、MSCMRseg和UK Biobank数据集上验证，性能优于弱监督方法，接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效利用粗标注，为医学图像分割提供了一种低成本高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality pixel-level annotations of medical images are essential for
supervised segmentation tasks, but obtaining such annotations is costly and
requires medical expertise. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
coarse-to-fine segmentation framework that relies entirely on coarse-level
annotations, encompassing both target and complementary drawings, despite their
inherent noise. The framework works by introducing transition matrices in order
to model the inaccurate and incomplete regions in the coarse annotations. By
jointly training on multiple sets of coarse annotations, it progressively
refines the network's outputs and infers the true segmentation distribution,
achieving a robust approximation of precise labels through matrix-based
modeling. To validate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method,
we demonstrate the results on two public cardiac imaging datasets, ACDC and
MSCMRseg, and further evaluate its performance on the UK Biobank dataset.
Experimental results indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art
weakly supervised methods and closely matches the fully supervised approach.

### [8] [MIDAR: Mimicking LiDAR Detection for Traffic Applications with a Lightweight Plug-and-Play Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02858)
*Tianheng Zhu,Yiheng Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIDAR是一个模拟LiDAR检测的模型，用于在微观交通模拟器中生成接近真实的检测结果，填补了高保真模拟器与可扩展性模拟器之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大规模真实自动驾驶车辆部署不现实，而现有模拟器在保真度和可扩展性之间存在矛盾，需要一种方法在微观交通模拟器中实现真实的LiDAR检测模拟。

Method: MIDAR通过车辆级特征预测真实检测结果，构建RM-LoS图编码遮挡关系，并采用GRU增强的APPNP架构进行特征传播。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，MIDAR的AUC达到0.909，接近主流3D LiDAR检测模型CenterPoint的结果。

Conclusion: MIDAR能够无缝集成到交通模拟器和轨迹数据集中，为需要精确车辆观测的协同感知应用提供支持，并将开源。

Abstract: As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has
focused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple
AVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale
real-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most
studies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity
raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce
realistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV
scenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale
efficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
propose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic
LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from
microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives
(TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the
spatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop
Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion
relationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP
architecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to
the prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the
detection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection
model, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further
validate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for
tasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position,
speed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be
seamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will
be open-sourced upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了基于Transformer的神经网络在高分辨率卫星图像中的物体检测性能，并与卷积网络进行了比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Transformer在计算机视觉中的崛起，研究其在遥感数据上的表现成为必要，尤其是与现有卷积网络的对比。

Result: Transformer架构在多个基准数据集上表现出色，展示了其在遥感图像中的先进性能。

Conclusion: Transformer在遥感图像物体检测中具有潜力，为未来的研究方向提供了基础。

Abstract: In 2012, AlexNet established deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as
the state-of-the-art in CV, as these networks soon led in visual tasks for many
domains, including remote sensing. With the publication of Visual Transformers,
we are witnessing the second modern leap in computational vision, and as such,
it is imperative to understand how various transformer-based neural networks
perform on satellite imagery. While transformers have shown high levels of
performance in natural language processing and CV applications, they have yet
to be compared on a large scale to modern remote sensing data. In this paper,
we explore the use of transformer-based neural networks for object detection in
high-resolution electro-optical satellite imagery, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance on a variety of publicly available benchmark data
sets. We compare eleven distinct bounding-box detection and localization
algorithms in this study, of which seven were published since 2020, and all
eleven since 2015. The performance of five transformer-based architectures is
compared with six convolutional networks on three state-of-the-art opensource
high-resolution remote sensing imagery datasets ranging in size and complexity.
Following the training and evaluation of thirty-three deep neural models, we
then discuss and analyze model performance across various feature extraction
methodologies and detection algorithms.

### [10] [VisuCraft: Enhancing Large Vision-Language Models for Complex Visual-Guided Creative Content Generation via Structured Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02890)
*Rongxin Jiang,Robert Long,Chenghao Gu,Mingrui Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisuCraft是一个新框架，通过多模态结构化信息提取器和动态提示生成模块，显著提升大型视觉语言模型在复杂视觉引导创意内容生成中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本时难以保持高视觉保真度、真实创意和精确遵循用户指令。

Method: VisuCraft整合了多模态结构化信息提取器和动态提示生成模块，优化生成提示以提高模型表现。

Result: 在ImageStoryGen-500K数据集上评估，VisuCraft在创意和指令遵循方面显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: VisuCraft为大型视觉语言模型在高级创意AI应用中开辟了新潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces VisuCraft, a novel framework designed to significantly
enhance the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in complex
visual-guided creative content generation. Existing LVLMs often exhibit
limitations in maintaining high visual fidelity, genuine creativity, and
precise adherence to nuanced user instructions when generating long-form texts.
VisuCraft addresses these challenges by integrating a multimodal structured
information extractor (E) and a dynamic prompt generation module (G). The
extractor distills fine-grained visual attributes from input images into a
rich, structured representation, which the dynamic prompt module then combines
with user instructions to create highly optimized prompts for underlying LVLMs
(e.g., LLaVA, InstructBLIP). Evaluated on the self-constructed
ImageStoryGen-500K dataset using VisuGen Metrics (Visual Grounding, Creativity,
and Instruction Adherence), VisuCraft consistently outperforms baseline LVLMs
across tasks like story generation and poetry composition. Our results
demonstrate remarkable improvements, particularly in creativity and instruction
adherence, validating VisuCraft's effectiveness in producing imaginative,
visually grounded, and user-aligned long-form creative text. This work unlocks
new potential for LVLMs in sophisticated creative AI applications.

*Mehrdad Moradi,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稳健回归的扩散模型，用于在仅有污染数据的情况下进行无监督异常分割，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型依赖纯净的正常数据训练，限制了实际应用。本文旨在解决仅有污染数据时的异常分割问题。

Method: 通过将最大似然估计转化为非线性回归问题，提出稳健去噪扩散概率模型（RDDPM）。

Result: 在MVTec数据集上，AUROC和AUPRC分别提升8.08%和10.37%。

Conclusion: RDDPM在污染数据场景下表现优异，为无监督异常分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success
in unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models
are first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an
intermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward
diffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely
on specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them
versatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically
assume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in
realistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion
models for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and
anomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood
estimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the
denoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust
regression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic
models. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust
diffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current
state of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when
only contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing
diffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\% higher AUROC and 10.37\%
higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets. The implementation code is available at:

Conclusion: 提出的方法在材料感知的RIR预测任务中表现优异，为动态声学特征生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: How would the sound in a studio change with a carpeted floor and acoustic
tiles on the walls? We introduce the task of material-controlled acoustic
profile generation, where, given an indoor scene with specific audio-visual
characteristics, the goal is to generate a target acoustic profile based on a
user-defined material configuration at inference time. We address this task
with a novel encoder-decoder approach that encodes the scene's key properties
from an audio-visual observation and generates the target Room Impulse Response
(RIR) conditioned on the material specifications provided by the user. Our
model enables the generation of diverse RIRs based on various material
configurations defined dynamically at inference time. To support this task, we
create a new benchmark, the Acoustic Wonderland Dataset, designed for
developing and evaluating material-aware RIR prediction methods under diverse
and challenging settings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively encodes material information and generates high-fidelity RIRs,
outperforming several baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了现成的大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在视觉与语言导航（VLN）任务中的表现，发现其虽能完成任务，但效果不及专为导航设计的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索现成LVLMs在VLN任务中的潜力，并验证其是否支持低级和全景动作范式。

Method: 在Room-to-Room数据集上微调开源模型Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct，评估其在低级和全景动作空间的表现。

Result: 最佳模型在R2R测试集上成功率为41%，表明现成LVLMs能完成VLN任务，但效果不如专用模型。

Conclusion: 现成LVLMs在VLN任务中表现尚可，但仍有改进空间，需进一步优化。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) refers to the task of enabling
autonomous robots to navigate unfamiliar environments by following natural
language instructions. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have
shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models
specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of
off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used
low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as "turn
left" or "move forward"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces
with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether
off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or
simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether
such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this
end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both
low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41%
success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs
can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind
models specifically designed for this task.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在盲去卷积中使用MAP估计时的问题，发现其倾向于模糊解。通过扩散先验分析，揭示了模糊图像具有更高似然性，并提出通过梯度下降找到局部极小值以获得清晰图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAP估计在盲去卷积中常产生模糊解，限制了其效果。本文旨在通过扩散先验分析解决这一问题。

Method: 使用扩散先验分析后验分布，发现模糊图像似然性更高，并通过梯度下降寻找局部极小值。

Result: MAP估计倾向于产生模糊解，但局部极小值对应清晰图像。

Conclusion: 克服MAP限制需良好局部初始化，实验验证了改进先验和优化技术的实用性。

Abstract: The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation is a widely used framework in blind
deconvolution to recover sharp images from blurred observations. The estimated
image and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior
distribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP
estimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its
effectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based
priors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through
an empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two
key properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,
the landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural
images. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
blind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to
produce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.
However local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient
descent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind
deconvolution problem. Our findings suggest that overcoming MAP's limitations
requires good local initialization to local minima in the posterior landscape.
We validate our analysis with numerical experiments, demonstrating the
practical implications of our insights for designing improved priors and
optimization techniques.

Result: 实验表明，ImageNet预训练对小型模型仍有帮助，但模型过小时，其鲁棒性提升效果会减弱。

Conclusion: 建议在实践中仍使用预训练，并避免选择过小的模型，以确保在不同工作条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require recognition models that are robust to
different operational conditions and modalities, but at the same time run on
small embedded devices, with limited hardware. While for normal size models,
pre-training is known to be very beneficial in accuracy and robustness, for
small models, that can be employed for embedded and edge devices, its effect is
not clear. In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on
increasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with $<$1M
parameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in
the infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object
recognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and
systematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different
datasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a
certain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of
out-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to
still use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they
might work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working
conditions are different.

TL;DR: X-Actor是一个音频驱动的肖像动画框架，通过单张参考图像和音频输入生成逼真、情感丰富的说话头部视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注唇部同步和短时视觉保真度，而X-Actor旨在实现演员级的长时肖像表演，捕捉动态演化的情感。

Method: 采用两阶段解耦生成流程：音频条件自回归扩散模型预测面部运动潜在标记，扩散视频合成模块将其转换为高保真视频。

Result: 实验表明，X-Actor能生成超越标准说话头部动画的电影级表演，并在长时音频驱动情感肖像表演中达到最优效果。

Conclusion: X-Actor通过解耦的面部运动潜在空间和扩散强制训练范式，实现了长时情感丰富的运动预测，推动了音频驱动肖像动画的发展。

Abstract: We present X-Actor, a novel audio-driven portrait animation framework that
generates lifelike, emotionally expressive talking head videos from a single
reference image and an input audio clip. Unlike prior methods that emphasize
lip synchronization and short-range visual fidelity in constrained speaking
scenarios, X-Actor enables actor-quality, long-form portrait performance
capturing nuanced, dynamically evolving emotions that flow coherently with the
rhythm and content of speech. Central to our approach is a two-stage decoupled
generation pipeline: an audio-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model that
predicts expressive yet identity-agnostic facial motion latent tokens within a
long temporal context window, followed by a diffusion-based video synthesis
module that translates these motions into high-fidelity video animations. By
operating in a compact facial motion latent space decoupled from visual and
identity cues, our autoregressive diffusion model effectively captures
long-range correlations between audio and facial dynamics through a
diffusion-forcing training paradigm, enabling infinite-length emotionally-rich
motion prediction without error accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that X-Actor produces compelling, cinematic-style performances that go beyond
standard talking head animations and achieves state-of-the-art results in
long-range, audio-driven emotional portrait acting.

*Dawei Zhang,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于尺度等变性的盲去噪框架，通过异构归一化模块和交互门控模块提升模型在空间非均匀噪声下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像去噪模型在空间变异性噪声（OOD条件）下泛化能力不足，尺度等变性作为核心归纳偏置有望解决这一问题。

Method: 提出包含异构归一化模块（HNM）和交互门控模块（IGM）的盲去噪框架，HNM稳定特征分布并动态校正噪声强度变化，IGM通过门控交互调节信号与特征路径的信息流。

Result: 模型在合成和真实世界数据集上均优于现有方法，尤其在空间异质性噪声条件下表现突出。

Conclusion: 尺度等变性是提升去噪模型OOD鲁棒性的有效归纳偏置，所提框架为盲去噪任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite notable advances in image denoising, existing models often struggle
to generalize beyond in-distribution noise patterns, particularly when
confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions characterized by spatially
variant noise. This generalization gap remains a fundamental yet underexplored
challenge. In this work, we investigate \emph{scale equivariance} as a core
inductive bias for improving OOD robustness. We argue that incorporating
scale-equivariant structures enables models to better adapt from training on
spatially uniform noise to inference on spatially non-uniform degradations.
Building on this insight, we propose a robust blind denoising framework
equipped with two key components: a Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM)
and an Interactive Gating Module (IGM). HNM stabilizes feature distributions
and dynamically corrects features under varying noise intensities, while IGM
facilitates effective information modulation via gated interactions between
signal and feature paths. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our model
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and
real-world benchmarks, especially under spatially heterogeneous noise. Code
will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: ANSWER是一种无需训练的采样方法，通过结合负提示和分类器自由引导（CFG），提升扩散模型生成图像与文本提示的匹配度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高质量图像时，对提示的遵从性和质量存在显著差异。负提示虽能改善提示遵从性，但需要外部资源且不完整。

Method: 提出ANSWER方法，利用扩散模型对否定的内部理解，结合CFG，从单一提示中同时处理正负条件。

Result: ANSWER在多个基准测试中优于基线方法，人类偏好度是其他方法的2倍。

Conclusion: ANSWER是一种通用且无需训练的技术，显著提升了扩散模型生成图像的提示匹配度。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to create
diverse and high-fidelity images from text prompts. However, they are also
well-known to vary substantially regarding both prompt adherence and quality.
Negative prompting was introduced to improve prompt compliance by specifying
what an image must not contain. Previous works have shown the existence of an
ideal negative prompt that can maximize the odds of the positive prompt. In
this work, we explore relations between negative prompting and classifier-free
guidance (CFG) to develop a sampling procedure, {\it Adaptive Negative Sampling
Without External Resources} (ANSWER), that accounts for both positive and
negative conditions from a single prompt. This leverages the internal
understanding of negation by the diffusion model to increase the odds of
generating images faithful to the prompt. ANSWER is a training-free technique,
applicable to any model that supports CFG, and allows for negative grounding of
image concepts without an explicit negative prompts, which are lossy and
incomplete. Experiments show that adding ANSWER to existing DMs outperforms the
baselines on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by humans 2x more over the
other methods.

Motivation: 现有多领域学习架构中，共享LoRA和领域特定LoRA的结构是否有效捕捉领域特定信息尚不明确。

Method: 提出一种方法，将共享和领域特定LoRA分别置于预训练权重的列子空间和左零子空间中。

Result: 在三个动作识别数据集（UCF101、Kinetics400和HMDB51）上验证了方法的有效性，并分析了LoRA权重的维度。

Conclusion: 该方法在某些情况下有效，同时提供了对LoRA权重维度的分析。

Abstract: Existing architectures of multi-domain learning have two types of adapters:
shared LoRA for all domains and domain-specific LoRA for each particular
domain. However, it remains unclear whether this structure effectively captures
domain-specific information. In this paper, we propose a method that ensures
that shared and domain-specific LoRAs exist in different subspaces;
specifically, the column and left null subspaces of the pre-trained weights. We
apply the proposed method to action recognition with three datasets (UCF101,
Kinetics400, and HMDB51) and demonstrate its effectiveness in some cases along
with the analysis of the dimensions of LoRA weights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗扰动方法在攻击Transformer-based检测器时效果有限，本文旨在提出一种通用的攻击框架，适用于不同架构的检测器。

Method: AFOG利用可学习的注意力机制，将扰动聚焦于多框检测任务中的脆弱区域，并通过迭代注入对抗扰动优化攻击损失。

Result: 实验表明，AFOG在攻击Transformer和CNN-based检测器时性能提升高达83%，且具有更高的速度和隐蔽性。

Conclusion: AFOG是一种高效、隐蔽且通用的对抗扰动方法，能够有效攻击多种目标检测模型。

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations are useful tools for exposing vulnerabilities in
neural networks. Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection
are either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against
transformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive
Gradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG
is neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large
transformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a
unified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original
contributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that
focuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks,
increasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second,
AFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss
through learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial
perturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial
perturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by
adding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which
can cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments
conducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the
efficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms
existing attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to
83% with superior speed and imperceptibility. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高质量图像的同时，存在被滥用于生成NSFW内容的风险。现有方法主要关注生成前或生成后的检测，而生成过程中的检测尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出In-Generation Detection（IGD），利用扩散过程中预测的噪声作为内部信号来识别NSFW内容。

Result: 在七类NSFW内容上，IGD的平均检测准确率为91.32%，优于七种基线方法。

Conclusion: IGD是一种简单有效的NSFW内容检测方法，尤其在对抗性提示下表现优异。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models enable high-quality image
generation but also pose significant risks of misuse, particularly in producing
not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content. While prior detection methods have focused on
filtering prompts before generation or moderating images afterward, the
in-generation phase of diffusion models remains largely unexplored for NSFW
detection. In this paper, we introduce In-Generation Detection (IGD), a simple
yet effective approach that leverages the predicted noise during the diffusion
process as an internal signal to identify NSFW content. This approach is
motivated by preliminary findings suggesting that the predicted noise may
capture semantic cues that differentiate NSFW from benign prompts, even when
the prompts are adversarially crafted. Experiments conducted on seven NSFW
categories show that IGD achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.32% over
naive and adversarial NSFW prompts, outperforming seven baseline methods.

### [23] [Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration via VFM for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03007)
*Xinhui Li,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MGFC的多粒度特征校准框架，用于提升域泛化语义分割（DGSS）的性能，通过从粗到细的特征校准增强模型在未见域上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注全局特征微调，忽略了跨特征层次的分层适配，而这对密集预测任务至关重要。

Method: MGFC框架分三步校准VFM特征：粗粒度特征捕获全局语义，中粒度特征提升类别区分能力，细粒度特征增强空间细节。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，MGFC优于现有DGSS方法，验证了多粒度适配的有效性。

Conclusion: MGFC通过分层和粒度感知的特征校准，成功将VFM的泛化能力迁移到DGSS任务中。

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) aims to improve the
generalization ability of models across unseen domains without access to target
data during training. Recent advances in DGSS have increasingly exploited
vision foundation models (VFMs) via parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies.
However, most existing approaches concentrate on global feature fine-tuning,
while overlooking hierarchical adaptation across feature levels, which is
crucial for precise dense prediction. In this paper, we propose
Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration (MGFC), a novel framework that performs
coarse-to-fine alignment of VFM features to enhance robustness under domain
shifts. Specifically, MGFC first calibrates coarse-grained features to capture
global contextual semantics and scene-level structure. Then, it refines
medium-grained features by promoting category-level feature discriminability.
Finally, fine-grained features are calibrated through high-frequency spatial
detail enhancement. By performing hierarchical and granularity-aware
calibration, MGFC effectively transfers the generalization strengths of VFMs to
the domain-specific task of DGSS. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS approaches,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-granularity adaptation for the semantic
segmentation task of domain generalization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SLFG的新方法，通过将视频帧组合成语义连贯的场景帧，提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在长视频理解中的表现，并开发了LVSQA数据集支持SceneQA任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在长视频理解中表现不佳，主要因资源限制无法处理所有帧信息，且现有评估任务与实际需求不符。

Method: 提出SLFG方法，结合场景定位和动态帧重组机制，无需修改原模型架构。

Result: 实验表明SLFG在多个长视频基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: SLFG方法有效提升了MLLMs的长视频理解能力，具有即插即用的实用性。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often perform poorly in long
video understanding, primarily due to resource limitations that prevent them
from processing all video frames and their associated information. Efficiently
extracting relevant information becomes a challenging task. Existing frameworks
and evaluation tasks focus on identifying specific frames containing core
objects from a large number of irrelevant frames, which does not align with the
practical needs of real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a
new scenario under the video question-answering task, SceneQA, which emphasizes
scene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities. And we develop the LVSQA
dataset to support the SceneQA task, which is built upon carefully selected
videos from LVBench and contains a new collection of question-answer pairs to
promote a more fair evaluation of MLLMs' scene perception abilities in long
videos. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce a novel method called SLFG.
The core idea of SLFG is to combine individual frames into semantically
coherent scene frames. By leveraging scene localization methods and dynamic
frame reassembly mechanisms, SLFG significantly enhances the understanding
capabilities of existing MLLMs in long videos. SLFG requires no modification to
the original model architecture and boasts excellent plug-and-play usability.
Experimental results show that this method performs exceptionally well in
several long video benchmark tests. Code and dataset will be released at
http://www.slfg.pkuzwh.cn.

TL;DR: SA-3DGS通过重要性评分和聚类压缩技术，显著减少3D高斯模型的存储需求，同时保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以识别场景中真正不重要的高斯点，导致压缩和渲染性能下降。

Method: SA-3DGS通过学习重要性评分识别不重要高斯点，利用聚类模块压缩属性，并通过修复模块恢复信息。

Result: 实验显示，该方法实现了高达66倍的压缩，且渲染质量未下降。

Conclusion: SA-3DGS在压缩和渲染质量上表现优异，并具有通用性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting have enhanced efficient and
high-quality novel view synthesis. However, representing scenes requires a
large number of Gaussian points, leading to high storage demands and limiting
practical deployment. The latest methods facilitate the compression of Gaussian
models but struggle to identify truly insignificant Gaussian points in the
scene, leading to a decline in subsequent Gaussian pruning, compression
quality, and rendering performance. To address this issue, we propose SA-3DGS,
a method that significantly reduces storage costs while maintaining rendering
quality. SA-3DGS learns an importance score to automatically identify the least
significant Gaussians in scene reconstruction, thereby enabling effective
pruning and redundancy reduction. Next, the importance-aware clustering module
compresses Gaussians attributes more accurately into the codebook, improving
the codebook's expressive capability while reducing model size. Finally, the
codebook repair module leverages contextual scene information to repair the
codebook, thereby recovering the original Gaussian point attributes and
mitigating the degradation in rendering quality caused by information loss.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method
achieves up to 66x compression while maintaining or even improving rendering
quality. The proposed Gaussian pruning approach is not only adaptable to but
also improves other pruning-based methods (e.g., LightGaussian), showcasing
excellent performance and strong generalization ability.

Result: 在CelebIPVid数据集上，MoCA在面部相似度上优于现有方法5%以上。

Conclusion: MoCA通过改进身份一致性和动态建模，显著提升了T2V生成的质量。

Abstract: Achieving ID-preserving text-to-video (T2V) generation remains challenging
despite recent advances in diffusion-based models. Existing approaches often
fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics or maintain temporal identity
coherence. To address these limitations, we propose MoCA, a novel Video
Diffusion Model built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, incorporating
a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts
paradigm. Our framework improves inter-frame identity consistency by embedding
MoCA layers into each DiT block, where Hierarchical Temporal Pooling captures
identity features over varying timescales, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention
Experts dynamically model spatiotemporal relationships. We further incorporate
a Latent Video Perceptual Loss to enhance identity coherence and fine-grained
details across video frames. To train this model, we collect CelebIPVid, a
dataset of 10,000 high-resolution videos from 1,000 diverse individuals,
promoting cross-ethnicity generalization. Extensive experiments on CelebIPVid
show that MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% across Face
similarity.

Abstract: Cross-video question answering presents significant challenges beyond
traditional single-video understanding, particularly in establishing meaningful
connections across video streams and managing the complexity of multi-source
information retrieval. We introduce VideoForest, a novel framework that
addresses these challenges through person-anchored hierarchical reasoning. Our
approach leverages person-level features as natural bridge points between
videos, enabling effective cross-video understanding without requiring
end-to-end training. VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a
human-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking
algorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple
video sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that
hierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and
3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this
hierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our
approach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset
specifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental
results demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning
tasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior
analysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly
outperforming existing methods. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-video understanding by unifying multiple video streams through
person-level features, enabling sophisticated reasoning across distributed
visual information while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Existing studies on talking video generation have predominantly focused on
single-person monologues or isolated facial animations, limiting their
applicability to realistic multi-human interactions. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MIT, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for multi-human
talking video generation. To this end, we develop an automatic pipeline that
collects and annotates multi-person conversational videos. The resulting
dataset comprises 12 hours of high-resolution footage, each featuring two to
four speakers, with fine-grained annotations of body poses and speech
interactions. It captures natural conversational dynamics in multi-speaker
scenario, offering a rich resource for studying interactive visual behaviors.
To demonstrate the potential of MIT, we furthur propose CovOG, a baseline model
for this novel task. It integrates a Multi-Human Pose Encoder (MPE) to handle
varying numbers of speakers by aggregating individual pose embeddings, and an
Interactive Audio Driver (IAD) to modulate head dynamics based on
speaker-specific audio features. Together, these components showcase the
feasibility and challenges of generating realistic multi-human talking videos,
establishing MIT as a valuable benchmark for future research. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人脸滤镜在遮挡情况下性能下降，需要一种能精细分离遮挡物与面部区域的方法。

Method: 提出FaceMat框架，采用两阶段训练：教师模型通过NLL损失预测alpha蒙版和不确定性，学生模型通过知识蒸馏学习。

Result: FaceMat在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，适用于实时应用。

Conclusion: FaceMat为遮挡下的人脸抠图提供了高效解决方案，并开源了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Face filters have become a key element of short-form video content, enabling
a wide array of visual effects such as stylization and face swapping. However,
their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects
like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,
we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha
mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present
FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality
alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage
training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes
and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this
uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive
knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on
ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic
consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation
masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for
real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by
explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling
clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed
CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for
occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the
visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained
video scenarios. The source code and CelebAMat dataset are available at

Abstract: Modality-agnostic Semantic Segmentation (MaSS) aims to achieve robust scene
understanding across arbitrary combinations of input modality. Existing methods
typically rely on explicit feature alignment to achieve modal homogenization,
which dilutes the distinctive strengths of each modality and destroys their
inherent complementarity. To achieve cooperative harmonization rather than
homogenization, we propose CHARM, a novel complementary learning framework
designed to implicitly align content while preserving modality-specific
advantages through two components: (1) Mutual Perception Unit (MPU), enabling
implicit alignment through window-based cross-modal interaction, where
modalities serve as both queries and contexts for each other to discover
modality-interactive correspondences; (2) A dual-path optimization strategy
that decouples training into Collaborative Learning Strategy (CoL) for
complementary fusion learning and Individual Enhancement Strategy (InE) for
protected modality-specific optimization. Experiments across multiple datasets
and backbones indicate that CHARM consistently outperform the baselines, with
significant increment on the fragile modalities. This work shifts the focus
from model homogenization to harmonization, enabling cross-modal
complementarity for true harmony in diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督域适应（UDA）在行人重识别（ReID）中的挑战，特别是在不同摄像头源图像特征差异和伪标签模糊性方面。

Method: 1. 使用CycleGAN生成多样化数据；2. 基于师生网络和多级聚类生成伪标签；3. 引入可学习的集成融合组件优化全局和局部特征。

Result: 在三个常见的UDA任务中表现优于现有方法，显著提升了平均精度和Top-k准确率。

Conclusion: CORE-ReID是一种高效且先进的UDA解决方案，能够清晰融合特征并避免模糊性，适用于行人重识别任务。

Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework, "Comprehensive Optimization and
Refinement through Ensemble Fusion in Domain Adaptation for Person
Re-identification (CORE-ReID)", to address an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) for Person Re-identification (ReID). The framework utilizes CycleGAN to
generate diverse data that harmonizes differences in image characteristics from
different camera sources in the pre-training stage. In the fine-tuning stage,
based on a pair of teacher-student networks, the framework integrates
multi-view features for multi-level clustering to derive diverse pseudo labels.
A learnable Ensemble Fusion component that focuses on fine-grained local
information within global features is introduced to enhance learning
comprehensiveness and avoid ambiguity associated with multiple pseudo-labels.
Experimental results on three common UDAs in Person ReID demonstrate
significant performance gains over state-of-the-art approaches. Additional
enhancements, such as Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean
Feature Normalization mitigate deviation effects and adaptive fusion of global
and local features using the ResNet-based model, further strengthening the
framework. The proposed framework ensures clarity in fusion features, avoids
ambiguity, and achieves high ac-curacy in terms of Mean Average Precision,
Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10, positioning it as an advanced and effective solution
for the UDA in Person ReID. Our codes and models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSFMamba是一种基于Mamba的对称驱动空间-频率特征融合网络，用于3D医学图像分割，通过双分支架构和Mamba块融合空间与频率域特征，提升全局上下文建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D医学图像分割中未能充分利用频率域信息的独特性质（如共轭对称性），且忽视了空间与频率域数据分布的差异，导致频率域的优势未被充分挖掘。

Method: 提出SSFMamba，采用双分支架构分别提取空间和频率域特征，利用Mamba块融合异构特征，并设计3D多方向扫描机制增强局部与全局线索融合。

Result: 在BraTS2020和BraTS2023数据集上的实验表明，SSFMamba在多项评估指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SSFMamba通过有效融合空间与频率域特征，显著提升了3D医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: In light of the spatial domain's limited capacity for modeling global context
in 3D medical image segmentation, emerging approaches have begun to incorporate
frequency domain representations. However, straightforward feature extraction
strategies often overlook the unique properties of frequency domain
information, such as conjugate symmetry. They also fail to account for the
fundamental differences in data distribution between the spatial and frequency
domains, which can ultimately dilute or obscure the complementary strengths
that frequency-based representations offer. In this paper, we propose SSFMamba,
a Mamba based Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency feature fusion network for 3D
medical image segmentation. SSFMamba employs a complementary dual-branch
architecture that extracts features from both the spatial and frequency
domains, and leverages a Mamba block to fuse these heterogeneous features to
preserve global context while reinforcing local details. In the frequency
domain branch, we harness Mamba's exceptional capability to extract global
contextual information in conjunction with the synergistic effect of frequency
domain features to further enhance global modeling. Moreover, we design a 3D
multi-directional scanning mechanism to strengthen the fusion of local and
global cues. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 提出RobustGS模块，提升3D高斯泼溅在恶劣成像条件下的鲁棒性，实现高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前馈3D高斯泼溅方法假设输入多视图图像干净高质量，但实际场景中图像常受噪声、低光或雨等影响，导致重建质量下降。

Method: 引入通用退化学习器和语义感知状态空间模型，增强退化感知能力并提升特征空间中的输入质量。

Result: 实验表明，RobustGS模块能显著提升重建质量，在各种退化条件下均达到最优。

Conclusion: RobustGS模块可无缝集成现有方法，显著提升3D重建的鲁棒性和质量。

Abstract: Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) overcomes the limitations of
optimization-based 3DGS by enabling fast and high-quality reconstruction
without the need for per-scene optimization. However, existing feedforward
approaches typically assume that input multi-view images are clean and
high-quality. In real-world scenarios, images are often captured under
challenging conditions such as noise, low light, or rain, resulting in
inaccurate geometry and degraded 3D reconstruction. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-view feature enhancement
module, RobustGS, which substantially improves the robustness of feedforward
3DGS methods under various adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D
reconstruction. The RobustGS module can be seamlessly integrated into existing
pretrained pipelines in a plug-and-play manner to enhance reconstruction
robustness. Specifically, we introduce a novel component, Generalized
Degradation Learner, designed to extract generic representations and
distributions of multiple degradations from multi-view inputs, thereby
enhancing degradation-awareness and improving the overall quality of 3D
reconstruction. In addition, we propose a novel semantic-aware state-space
model. It first leverages the extracted degradation representations to enhance
corrupted inputs in the feature space. Then, it employs a semantic-aware
strategy to aggregate semantically similar information across different views,
enabling the extraction of fine-grained cross-view correspondences and further
improving the quality of 3D representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach, when integrated into existing methods in a plug-and-play
manner, consistently achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across
various types of degradations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注人口属性（如种族、性别），但对更广泛属性的公平性研究不足。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）构建开放知识库，评估LVLMs在细粒度属性上的公平性。

Result: LVLMs在多种属性上表现出偏见，文化、环境及行为因素比传统人口属性影响更显著。

Conclusion: 需关注LVLMs在更广泛属性上的公平性，文化等因素对模型决策影响更大。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of applications using Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, has raised significant concerns about their fairness.
While existing studies primarily focus on demographic attributes such as race
and gender, fairness across a broader range of attributes remains largely
unexplored. In this study, we construct an open-set knowledge base of bias
attributes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the fairness of
LVLMs across finer-grained attributes. Our experimental results reveal that
LVLMs exhibit biased outputs across a diverse set of attributes and further
demonstrate that cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors have a more
pronounced impact on LVLM decision-making than traditional demographic
attributes.

Result: 实验表明$C^2Aug$在多项评估指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: $C^2Aug$通过增加伪包多样性和对比学习，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Recent pseudo-bag augmentation methods for Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL)-based Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification sample instances from a
limited number of bags, resulting in constrained diversity. To address this
issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample
instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of
pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases
the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results
in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances,
thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small
tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level
contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with
distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗图像分类系统需要适应动态变化的临床环境，现有方法仅依赖简单的文本模板，忽略了更丰富的语义信息。

Method: 动态构建视觉概念池，采用相似性过滤机制避免冗余，并通过跨模态图像-概念注意力模块和注意力损失整合概念。

Result: 在医疗和自然图像数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且优越，代码将公开。

Abstract: Continual learning is essential for medical image classification systems to
adapt to dynamically evolving clinical environments. The integration of
multimodal information can significantly enhance continual learning of image
classes. However, while existing approaches do utilize textual modality
information, they solely rely on simplistic templates with a class name,
thereby neglecting richer semantic information. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel framework that harnesses visual concepts generated by large
language models (LLMs) as discriminative semantic guidance. Our method
dynamically constructs a visual concept pool with a similarity-based filtering
mechanism to prevent redundancy. Then, to integrate the concepts into the
continual learning process, we employ a cross-modal image-concept attention
module, coupled with an attention loss. Through attention, the module can
leverage the semantic knowledge from relevant visual concepts and produce
class-representative fused features for classification. Experiments on medical
and natural image datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method. We
will release the code publicly.

TL;DR: AVATAR框架通过离策略训练和时序优势塑造解决了多模态长视频推理中的效率、优势消失和信用分配问题，性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法（如GRPO）在数据效率、优势消失和信用分配上的不足。

Method: 采用离策略训练架构提高样本效率，引入时序优势塑造（TAS）策略优化信用分配。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，性能提升显著，样本效率提高35%以上。

Conclusion: AVATAR有效解决了多模态长视频推理的挑战，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning over long-horizon video is challenging due to the need
for precise spatiotemporal fusion and alignment across modalities. While recent
methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in
this domain, they suffer from three key limitations: (1) data inefficiency from
their on-policy design, (2) a vanishing advantage problem, where identical or
near-identical rewards within a group eliminate the learning signal by
producing zero-valued advantages, and (3) uniform credit assignment that fails
to emphasize critical reasoning steps. We introduce AVATAR (Audio-Video Agent
for Alignment and Reasoning), a framework that addresses these limitations
through two core components: (1) an off-policy training architecture that
improves sample efficiency and resolves vanishing advantages by reusing past
experiences with greater reward diversity, and (2) Temporal Advantage Shaping
(TAS), a novel credit assignment strategy that upweights key reasoning phases
during learning. AVATAR achieves strong performance across various benchmarks,
outperforming the Qwen2.5-Omni baseline by +5.4on MMVU, +4.9 on OmniBench, and
+4.5 on Video-Holmes, while demonstrating over 35% higher sample efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA)，通过无监督独立成分分析(ICA)显式解耦CLIP提取的视觉特征，减少可训练参数并避免过拟合，同时利用CLIP的跨模态对齐提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本学习方法依赖隐式解耦表示，限制了模型的有效适应。

Method: 提出CCA框架，结合ICA解耦视觉特征，并通过单向和双向方式增强CLIP的跨模态对齐。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，且计算高效。

Conclusion: CCA在少样本学习和分布偏移鲁棒性上表现优异。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) often requires effective adaptation of models using
limited labeled data. However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled
representations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process
to obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which
hinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal
contrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent
representations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the
Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles
visual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component
Analysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the
labeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and
mitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual
disentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal
alignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent
cross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through
fine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a
cross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations
through mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification
outputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
few-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Code will be available at

Conclusion: H3R通过混合框架和空间对齐的基础模型，显著提升了3D重建的泛化能力和效率，适用于多视角高分辨率输入。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting, generalizable
3D reconstruction remains challenging, particularly in multi-view
correspondence modeling. Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off:
explicit methods achieve geometric precision but struggle with ambiguous
regions, while implicit methods provide robustness but suffer from slow
convergence. We present H3R, a hybrid framework that addresses this limitation
by integrating volumetric latent fusion with attention-based feature
aggregation. Our framework consists of two complementary components: an
efficient latent volume that enforces geometric consistency through epipolar
constraints, and a camera-aware Transformer that leverages Pl\"ucker
coordinates for adaptive correspondence refinement. By integrating both
paradigms, our approach enhances generalization while converging 2$\times$
faster than existing methods. Furthermore, we show that spatial-aligned
foundation models (e.g., SD-VAE) substantially outperform semantic-aligned
models (e.g., DINOv2), resolving the mismatch between semantic representations
and spatial reconstruction requirements. Our method supports variable-number
and high-resolution input views while demonstrating robust cross-dataset
generalization. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, with significant PSNR
improvements of 0.59 dB, 1.06 dB, and 0.22 dB on the RealEstate10K, ACID, and
DTU datasets, respectively. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为COFFEE的实时姿态估计框架，用于解决太空中小天体姿态估计中的阴影干扰问题，比传统方法更准确且计算效率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太空中小天体的精确姿态估计对任务成功至关重要，但现有方法（如SIFT、ORB、AKAZE）在实时性和准确性上存在不足，且对自投射阴影不鲁棒，可能导致姿态估计偏差。

Method: COFFEE框架利用太阳相位角先验信息，通过关联显著轮廓与阴影检测稀疏特征，结合稀疏神经网络和注意力图神经网络进行特征匹配。

Result: COFFEE在合成数据和小行星Apophis的渲染数据上表现无偏差，比传统方法更准确，计算速度比其他深度学习方法快一个数量级。

Conclusion: COFFEE为小天体实时姿态估计提供了一种高效、准确的解决方案，适用于太空任务中的实时需求。

Abstract: The accurate state estimation of unknown bodies in space is a critical
challenge with applications ranging from the tracking of space debris to the
shape estimation of small bodies. A necessary enabler to this capability is to
find and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods,
such as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates,
whereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost
of more demanding computational resources which might not be available on
space-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods
are not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of
interest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to
large biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the
real-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state
estimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a
chaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast
FEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed
to leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking
sensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours
to their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to
the motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an
attention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly
trained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The
resulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than
classical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other
state-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on
renderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with
satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert
workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale
automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term,
high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking
low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are
essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap
with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter
resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over
Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components:
Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing 196,262 image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA,
comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across
eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped
pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human
verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark
reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The
open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in
captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current
approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on
Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and
boosts VQA accuracy from \textbf{0.74} to 0.87. Code and data are available at

Abstract: The exponential growth in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) usage underscores
the critical need of detecting them at extended distances to ensure safe
operations, especially in densely populated areas. Despite the tremendous
advances made in computer vision through deep learning, the detection of these
small airborne objects remains a formidable challenge. While several datasets
have been developed specifically for drone detection, the need for a more
extensive and diverse collection of drone image data persists, particularly for
long-range detection under varying environmental conditions. We introduce here
the Long Range Drone Detection (LRDD) Version 2 dataset, comprising 39,516
meticulously annotated images, as a second release of the LRDD dataset released
previously. The LRDDv2 dataset enhances the LRDDv1 by incorporating a greater
variety of images, providing a more diverse and comprehensive resource for
drone detection research. What sets LRDDv2 apart is its inclusion of target
range information for over 8,000 images, making it possible to develop
algorithms for drone range estimation. Tailored for long-range aerial object
detection, the majority of LRDDv2's dataset consists of images capturing drones
with 50 or fewer pixels in 1080p resolution. For access to the complete

Abstract: We would like to estimate the pose and full shape of an object from a single
observation, without assuming known 3D model or category. In this work, we
propose OmniShape, the first method of its kind to enable probabilistic pose

completion can be decoupled into two multi-modal distributions: one capturing
how measurements project into a normalized object reference frame defined by
the dataset and the other modelling a prior over object geometries represented
as triplanar neural fields. By training separate conditional diffusion models
for these two distributions, we enable sampling multiple hypotheses from the
joint pose and shape distribution. OmniShape demonstrates compelling
performance on challenging real world datasets. Project website:

Abstract: Fire scene datasets are crucial for training robust computer vision models,
particularly in tasks such as fire early warning and emergency rescue
operations. However, among the currently available fire-related data, there is
a significant shortage of annotated data specifically targeting building
units.To tackle this issue, we introduce an annotated dataset of building units
captured by drones, which incorporates multiple enhancement techniques. We
construct backgrounds using real multi-story scenes, combine motion blur and
brightness adjustment to enhance the authenticity of the captured images,
simulate drone shooting conditions under various circumstances, and employ

*Youquan Liu,Lingdong Kong,Weidong Yang,Ao Liang,Jianxiong Gao,Yang Wu,Xiang Xu,Xin Li,Linfeng Li,Runnan Chen,Ben Fei*

TL;DR: Veila提出了一种基于条件扩散框架的LiDAR数据生成方法，通过RGB图像作为控制信号，解决了现有方法在可控性和跨模态对齐上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LiDAR数据生成方法要么缺乏可控性，要么依赖文本引导，无法实现细粒度空间控制。利用RGB图像作为控制信号是一种低成本且可扩展的解决方案，但面临语义深度不一致、模态差异和结构一致性等挑战。

Method: Veila框架包含三个核心组件：CACM（自适应平衡语义和深度线索）、GCMA（跨模态几何对齐）和PFC（全景特征一致性）。此外，提出了两种评估指标（语义一致性和深度一致性）。

Result: 在nuScenes、SemanticKITTI和KITTI-Weather数据集上，Veila在生成保真度和跨模态一致性上达到最优，并能提升下游LiDAR语义分割性能。

Conclusion: Veila通过创新的条件扩散框架和跨模态对齐机制，显著提升了LiDAR数据生成的可靠性和实用性。

Abstract: Realistic and controllable panoramic LiDAR data generation is critical for
scalable 3D perception in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods
either perform unconditional generation with poor controllability or adopt
text-guided synthesis, which lacks fine-grained spatial control. Leveraging a
monocular RGB image as a spatial control signal offers a scalable and low-cost
alternative, which remains an open problem. However, it faces three core
challenges: (i) semantic and depth cues from RGB are vary spatially,
complicating reliable conditioning generation; (ii) modality gaps between RGB
appearance and LiDAR geometry amplify alignment errors under noisy diffusion;
and (iii) maintaining structural coherence between monocular RGB and panoramic
LiDAR is challenging, particularly in non-overlap regions between images and
LiDAR. To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional
diffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism
(CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and
depth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal
Alignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a
Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency
across monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two
metrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to
evaluate alignment quality across modalities. Experiments on nuScenes,
SemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila
achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency,
while enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR
semantic segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的框架UniEdit-I，通过理解、编辑和验证三个迭代步骤，为统一视觉语言模型（VLM）添加图像编辑能力，并在GEdit-Bench上实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管OpenAI的GPT-4o提出的生成管道（理解VLM->视觉特征->投影器->扩散模型->图像）展示了统一VLM的未来潜力，但如何轻松实现图像编辑能力仍未探索。

Method: UniEdit-I通过三步迭代实现图像编辑：1）理解步骤分析源图像生成源提示并替换关键词形成目标提示；2）编辑步骤引入时间自适应偏移实现从粗到细的连贯编辑；3）验证步骤检查目标提示与中间编辑图像的对齐并提供反馈。

Result: 基于BLIP3-o实现的方法在GEdit-Bench上达到了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: UniEdit-I为统一VLM提供了一种无需训练的高保真图像编辑解决方案，展示了未来发展的潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, unified vision-language models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced,
effectively tackling both visual understanding and generation tasks within a
single design. While many unified VLMs have explored various design choices,
the recent hypothesis from OpenAI's GPT-4o suggests a promising generation
pipeline: Understanding VLM->Visual Feature->Projector->Diffusion Model->Image.
The understanding VLM is frozen, and only the generation-related modules are
trained. This pipeline maintains the strong capability of understanding VLM
while enabling the image generation ability of the unified VLM. Although this
pipeline has shown very promising potential for the future development of
unified VLM, how to easily enable image editing capability is still unexplored.
In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free framework named UniEdit-I to
enable the unified VLM with image editing capability via three iterative steps:
understanding, editing, and verifying. 1. The understanding step analyzes the
source image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and
makes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing
instruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing
for coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3.
The verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the
intermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective
feedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop.
This understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence,
delivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner. We implemented our
method based on the latest BLIP3-o and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在LiDAR场景生成中缺乏对前景对象和空间关系的显式控制，限制了其在场景模拟和安全验证中的应用。

Method: 提出了语义增强的场景图扩散和关系感知上下文条件，结合前景感知控制注入，实现结构化LiDAR布局生成和完整场景生成。

Conclusion: La La LiDAR为可控3D场景生成设立了新基准，支持对象放置的自定义控制，同时确保空间和语义一致性。

Abstract: Controllable generation of realistic LiDAR scenes is crucial for applications
such as autonomous driving and robotics. While recent diffusion-based models
achieve high-fidelity LiDAR generation, they lack explicit control over
foreground objects and spatial relationships, limiting their usefulness for
scenario simulation and safety validation. To address these limitations, we
propose Large-scale Layout-guided LiDAR generation model ("La La LiDAR"), a
novel layout-guided generative framework that introduces semantic-enhanced
scene graph diffusion with relation-aware contextual conditioning for
structured LiDAR layout generation, followed by foreground-aware control
injection for complete scene generation. This enables customizable control over
object placement while ensuring spatial and semantic consistency. To support
our structured LiDAR generation, we introduce Waymo-SG and nuScenes-SG, two
large-scale LiDAR scene graph datasets, along with new evaluation metrics for
layout synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that La La LiDAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both LiDAR generation and downstream perception
tasks, establishing a new benchmark for controllable 3D scene generation.

TL;DR: SARD是一种基于扩散的异常生成框架，通过区域约束扩散和判别性掩模指导，提升异常合成的空间控制性和区域保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散方法在空间控制和区域保真度上表现不足，需要一种更精确的异常合成方法以增强工业异常检测系统的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出SARD框架，结合区域约束扩散（RCD）和判别性掩模指导（DMG），选择性更新异常区域并评估全局和局部保真度。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和BTAD数据集上，SARD在分割精度和视觉质量上超越现有方法，达到新最优水平。

Conclusion: SARD通过区域约束和掩模指导，显著提升了异常合成的精确性和质量，为工业应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic and spatially precise anomalies is essential for
enhancing the robustness of industrial anomaly detection systems. While recent
diffusion-based methods have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling
complex defect patterns, they often struggle with spatial controllability and
fail to maintain fine-grained regional fidelity. To overcome these limitations,
we propose SARD (Segmentation-Aware anomaly synthesis via Region-constrained
Diffusion with discriminative mask Guidance), a novel diffusion-based framework
specifically designed for anomaly generation. Our approach introduces a
Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) process that preserves the background by
freezing it and selectively updating only the foreground anomaly regions during
the reverse denoising phase, thereby effectively reducing background artifacts.
Additionally, we incorporate a Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) module into
the discriminator, enabling joint evaluation of both global realism and local
anomaly fidelity, guided by pixel-level masks. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec-AD and BTAD datasets show that SARD surpasses existing methods in
segmentation accuracy and visual quality, setting a new state-of-the-art for
pixel-level anomaly synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成世界模型多关注视频或占用网格，忽视了LiDAR特性，动态4D LiDAR建模在可控性、时间一致性和评估标准化方面存在挑战。

Method: 将自然语言指令解析为场景图，通过三分支扩散网络生成对象结构、运动轨迹和几何形状，并结合自回归模块生成时间一致的序列。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，LiDARCrafter在保真度、可控性和时间一致性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: LiDARCrafter为数据增强和仿真提供了新途径，代码和基准已开源。

Abstract: Generative world models have become essential data engines for autonomous
driving, yet most existing efforts focus on videos or occupancy grids,
overlooking the unique LiDAR properties. Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic
4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence,
and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified
framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language
inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a
tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion
trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and
fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates
temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support
standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse
metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on
the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and
temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation
and simulation. The code and benchmark are released to the community.

TL;DR: 论文提出LORE方法，通过优化反转噪声解决现有文本驱动图像编辑中的语义偏差问题，实现稳定、可控的通用概念替换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于反转流的图像编辑方法在语义相似性较低时存在编辑失败或非目标区域意外修改的问题。

Method: 提出LORE，一种无需训练的高效图像编辑方法，直接优化反转噪声，提升泛化性和可控性。

Result: 在PIEBench、SmartEdit和GapEdit三个基准测试中，LORE在语义对齐、图像质量和背景保真度上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LORE通过潜在空间优化实现了通用图像编辑的高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Text-driven image editing enables users to flexibly modify visual content
through natural language instructions, and is widely applied to tasks such as
semantic object replacement, insertion, and removal. While recent
inversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models have achieved
promising results in image quality, we identify a structural limitation in
their editing behavior: the semantic bias toward the source concept encoded in
the inverted noise tends to suppress attention to the target concept. This
issue becomes particularly critical when the source and target semantics are
dissimilar, where the attention mechanism inherently leads to editing failure
or unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we
systematically analyze and validate this structural flaw, and introduce LORE, a
training-free and efficient image editing method. LORE directly optimizes the
inverted noise, addressing the core limitations in generalization and
controllability of existing approaches, enabling stable, controllable, and
general-purpose concept replacement, without requiring architectural
modification or model fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on
three challenging benchmarks: PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit. Experimental
results show that LORE significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of
semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity, demonstrating the
effectiveness and scalability of latent-space optimization for general-purpose
image editing.

Motivation: 现有真实图表数据集包含无关信息且未能充分捕捉结构和关键见解，导致视觉语言模型生成标注时存在挑战。

Method: 设计四阶段流程生成仅基于图表可辨识数据的标注，并采用循环一致性人工验证加速质量控制。提出视觉一致性评分评估标注质量。

Result: 实验证明，基于ChartCap微调的模型生成更准确、信息丰富的标注，减少幻觉，优于开源、专有模型及人工标注。

Conclusion: ChartCap通过高质量数据集和新评估方法，显著提升图表标注的准确性和信息量。

Abstract: Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts
remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of
large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing
real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information
that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture
structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a
large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific,
dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both
structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a
four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data
from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which
accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption
quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a
caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive
experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate
more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing
both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风格化图像在游戏场景理解、艺术教育和医学分析等关键场景中具有重要作用，但现有方法未能有效解决其引发的幻觉问题。

Method: 构建了一个包含摄影图像及其风格化版本的数据集，并提出了Style-Aware Visual Early Revision（SAVER）机制，通过动态调整模型输出来减少幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，风格化图像比摄影图像更容易引发幻觉，而SAVER在多种模型、数据集和任务中均表现出色。

Conclusion: SAVER为解决风格化图像引发的幻觉问题提供了有效方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) recently achieve significant
breakthroughs in understanding complex visual-textual contexts. However,
hallucination issues still limit their real-world applicability. Although
previous mitigation methods effectively reduce hallucinations in photographic
images, they largely overlook the potential risks posed by stylized images,
which play crucial roles in critical scenarios such as game scene
understanding, art education, and medical analysis. In this work, we first
construct a dataset comprising photographic images and their corresponding
stylized versions with carefully annotated caption labels. We then conduct
head-to-head comparisons on both discriminative and generative tasks by
benchmarking 13 advanced LVLMs on the collected datasets. Our findings reveal
that stylized images tend to induce significantly more hallucinations than
their photographic counterparts. To address this issue, we propose Style-Aware
Visual Early Revision SAVER, a novel mechanism that dynamically adjusts LVLMs'
final outputs based on the token-level visual attention patterns, leveraging
early-layer feedback to mitigate hallucinations caused by stylized images.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAVER achieves state-of-the-art
performance in hallucination mitigation across various models, datasets, and
tasks.

Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法依赖计算密集的顺序alpha混合操作，导致资源受限平台上的性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出Duplex-GS框架，结合代理高斯表示和顺序无关渲染技术，引入单元代理和单元搜索光栅化优化。

Result: 实验显示，Duplex-GS在多种场景下表现稳健，渲染速度提升1.5至4倍，排序开销减少52.2%至86.9%。

Conclusion: Duplex-GS验证了顺序无关渲染在高斯泼溅中的优势，实现了高质量实时渲染。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
rendering fidelity and efficiency. However, these methods still rely on
computationally expensive sequential alpha-blending operations, resulting in
significant overhead, particularly on resource-constrained platforms. In this
paper, we propose Duplex-GS, a dual-hierarchy framework that integrates proxy
Gaussian representations with order-independent rendering techniques to achieve
photorealistic results while sustaining real-time performance. To mitigate the
overhead caused by view-adaptive radix sort, we introduce cell proxies for
local Gaussians management and propose cell search rasterization for further
acceleration. By seamlessly combining our framework with Order-Independent
Transparency (OIT), we develop a physically inspired weighted sum rendering
technique that simultaneously eliminates "popping" and "transparency"
artifacts, yielding substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency.
Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the
robustness of our method across diverse scenarios, including multi-scale
training views and large-scale environments. Our results validate the
advantages of the OIT rendering paradigm in Gaussian Splatting, achieving
high-quality rendering with an impressive 1.5 to 4 speedup over existing OIT
based Gaussian Splatting approaches and 52.2% to 86.9% reduction of the radix
sort overhead without quality degradation.

Motivation: 单目深度估计因单视图的固有模糊性而具有挑战性，需结合局部和全局信息以提高准确性。

Result: 在NYU-V2和KITTI数据集上表现优异，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: GLKAM和GBPM模块有效提升了深度估计的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation remains a challenging problem due to the
inherent ambiguity that stems from the ill-posed nature of recovering 3D
structure from a single view, where multiple plausible depth configurations can
produce identical 2D projections. In this paper, we present a novel depth
estimation method that combines both local and global cues to improve
prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose the Gated Large Kernel Attention
Module (GLKAM) to effectively capture multi-scale local structural information
by leveraging large kernel convolutions with a gated mechanism. To further
enhance the global perception of the network, we introduce the Global Bin
Prediction Module (GBPM), which estimates the global distribution of depth bins
and provides structural guidance for depth regression. Extensive experiments on
the NYU-V2 and KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance and outperforms existing approaches, validating the effectiveness
of each proposed component.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在减少遗忘的同时实现了优越的性能。

Conclusion: KAN-CFD框架有效解决了持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，为人脸伪造检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in face forgery techniques necessitate that detectors
continuously adapt to new forgery methods, thus situating face forgery
detection within a continual learning paradigm. However, when detectors learn
new forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly,
a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling
them to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while
leaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for
addressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant
limitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional
images, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images
lack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when
features from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to
distinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the
same regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery
Detection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector
(DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift
Compensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional
image inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity. FS-KDCP avoids the
overlap of the KAN input spaces without using data from prior tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
performance while notably reducing forgetting.

Abstract: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a primary characteristic of wet
age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), represents a leading cause of
blindness worldwide. In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography
angiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological
changes, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus,
accurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for
clinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular
CNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and
boundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets
constraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper
constructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a
novel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation
network (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological
information, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the
graph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two
graph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR)
and Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework
encodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the
image into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason
about higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism,
enabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally,
an uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts
and noise on segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that
MTG-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving a Dice socre of 87.21\% for
region segmentation and 88.12\% for vessel segmentation.

Abstract: Weakly supervised visual grounding (VG) aims to locate objects in images
based on text descriptions. Despite significant progress, existing methods lack
strong cross-modal reasoning to distinguish subtle semantic differences in text
expressions due to category-based and attribute-based ambiguity. To address
these challenges, we introduce AlignCAT, a novel query-based semantic matching
framework for weakly supervised VG. To enhance visual-linguistic alignment, we
propose a coarse-grained alignment module that utilizes category information
and global context, effectively mitigating interference from
category-inconsistent objects. Subsequently, a fine-grained alignment module
leverages descriptive information and captures word-level text features to
achieve attribute consistency. By exploiting linguistic cues to their fullest
extent, our proposed AlignCAT progressively filters out misaligned visual
queries and enhances contrastive learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on
three VG benchmarks, namely RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, verify the
superiority of AlignCAT against existing weakly supervised methods on two VG
tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/AlignCAT.

Conclusion: INP-CC通过动态提示和概念校准有效提升了开放词汇HOI检测的性能。

Abstract: Open Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to detect
interactions between humans and objects while generalizing to novel interaction
classes beyond the training set. Current methods often rely on Vision and
Language Models (VLMs) but face challenges due to suboptimal image encoders, as
image-level pre-training does not align well with the fine-grained region-level
interaction detection required for HOI. Additionally, effectively encoding
textual descriptions of visual appearances remains difficult, limiting the
model's ability to capture detailed HOI relationships. To address these issues,
we propose INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC), an
end-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware
prompts and concept calibration. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware
prompt generator that dynamically generates a compact set of prompts based on
the input scene, enabling selective sharing among similar interactions. This
approach directs the model's attention to key interaction patterns rather than
generic image-level semantics, enhancing HOI detection. Furthermore, we refine
HOI concept representations through language model-guided calibration, which
helps distinguish diverse HOI concepts by investigating visual similarities
across categories. A negative sampling strategy is also employed to improve
inter-modal similarity modeling, enabling the model to better differentiate
visually similar but semantically distinct actions. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that INP-CC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
models on the SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastInit提出了一种快速噪声初始化方法，通过单次前向传播生成高质量视频噪声，显著提升生成效率并保持时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成方法（如FreeInit）需要迭代优化噪声，计算成本高，FastInit旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FastInit训练了一个视频噪声预测网络（VNPNet），通过单次前向传播生成优化后的噪声，无需迭代。

Result: 实验表明，FastInit显著提升了视频生成的质量和时间一致性，同时降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: FastInit为视频生成提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案，可直接应用于推理阶段。

Abstract: Video generation has made significant strides with the development of
diffusion models; however, achieving high temporal consistency remains a
challenging task. Recently, FreeInit identified a training-inference gap and
introduced a method to iteratively refine the initial noise during inference.
However, iterative refinement significantly increases the computational cost
associated with video generation. In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast
noise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement.
FastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random
noise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward
pass. Therefore, FastInit greatly enhances the efficiency of video generation
while achieving high temporal consistency across frames. To train the VNPNet,
we create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random
noise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video
models show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal
consistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial
improvement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can
be applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.

*Xinwei Liu,Xiaojun Jia,Yuan Xun,Simeng Qin,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoShield是一种新的对抗性框架，旨在保护地理隐私，通过特征解耦、暴露元素识别和尺度自适应增强模块，有效抵御高级视觉语言模型的地理位置推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型（如GPT-4o）能够从公开共享的图像中推断用户位置，地理隐私面临重大风险，现有对抗性扰动方法在高分辨率图像和低扰动预算下效果不佳。

Method: GeoShield包含三个模块：特征解耦模块分离地理和非地理信息，暴露元素识别模块定位图像中的地理揭示区域，尺度自适应增强模块联合优化全局和局部扰动。

Result: 实验表明，GeoShield在黑盒设置中优于现有方法，提供强隐私保护且对视觉或语义质量影响最小。

Conclusion: GeoShield是首个探索对抗性扰动防御高级视觉语言模型地理推断的研究，为解决日益增长的隐私问题提供了实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable
ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a
substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a
potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often
perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may
introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose
GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy
protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a
feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical
information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints
geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module
that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure
effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in
black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on
visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore
adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by
advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating
privacy concerns.

Motivation: 对抗性扰动对深度学习模型构成威胁，现有防御方法如对抗训练计算成本高且影响标准性能，数据增强方法则效果有限或训练开销大。

Method: 提出UAA框架，通过离线预计算通用变换，高效生成对抗扰动，避免训练时在线生成的高成本。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，UAA实现了数据增强对抗防御的最先进性能，且无需在线生成对抗样本。

Conclusion: UAA为构建高效且鲁棒的模型提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations pose a significant threat to deep learning models.
Adversarial Training (AT), the predominant defense method, faces challenges of
high computational costs and a degradation in standard performance. While data
augmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield
limited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore,
developing a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly
robust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic
analysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among
diverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing
robustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial
Augmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature
and training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation
process from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation
offline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial
perturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results
demonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for
data-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the
online generation of adversarial examples during training. This framework
provides a practical and efficient pathway for building robust models,Our code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ActionSink的新型机器人操作框架，通过自监督方式将机器人动作重新定义为视频中的光流（称为“动作流”），并通过检索和整合动作流来提高动作估计的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型预训练模型在高层次感知和规划方面取得进展，但低层次动作估计的低精度成为机器人操作性能的主要限制因素。

Method: ActionSink包含两个主要模块：1）粗到细的动作流匹配器，通过迭代检索和去噪提高动作流精度；2）动态动作流整合器，利用工作记忆池动态管理历史动作流，并通过多层融合模块整合当前和历史的动作流。

Result: ActionSink在LIBERO基准测试中比现有最佳方法提高了7.9%的成功率，在LIBERO-Long任务中获得了近8%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: ActionSink通过自监督动作流和动态整合机制，显著提升了机器人操作的动作估计精度。

Abstract: Language-instructed robot manipulation has garnered significant interest due
to the potential of learning from collected data. While the challenges in
high-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress
of general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action
estimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.
To this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,
ActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of
learning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink
reformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos,
called "action flow", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be
retrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically,
ActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a
coarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of
action flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is
a dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that
dynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be
used to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a
multi-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action
flows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate
action estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes. Our
ActionSink framework outperformed prior SOTA on the LIBERO benchmark by a 7.9\%
success rate, and obtained nearly an 8\% accuracy gain on the challenging
long-horizon visual task LIBERO-Long.

Motivation: 现有方法在2D到3D分割中因忽略语义线索导致不一致的2D掩码和噪声边界。

Method: 引入GIT，扩展高斯表示，利用实例权重矩阵校正2D分割不一致性，并提出自适应密度控制机制优化高斯分布。

Result: 实验表明，GIT能提取干净的3D资产，并在多种设置下提升3D分割效果。

Conclusion: GIT方法显著改善了2D和3D分割的一致性，支持分层分割、对象提取等应用。

Abstract: We address the challenge of lifting 2D visual segmentation to 3D in Gaussian
Splatting. Existing methods often suffer from inconsistent 2D masks across
viewpoints and produce noisy segmentation boundaries as they neglect these
semantic cues to refine the learned Gaussians. To overcome this, we introduce
Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT), which augments the standard Gaussian
representation with an instance weight matrix across input views. Leveraging
the inherent consistency of Gaussians in 3D, we use this matrix to identify and
correct 2D segmentation inconsistencies. Furthermore, since each Gaussian
ideally corresponds to a single object, we propose a GIT-guided adaptive
density control mechanism to split and prune ambiguous Gaussians during
training, resulting in sharper and more coherent 2D and 3D segmentation
boundaries. Experimental results show that our method extracts clean 3D assets
and consistently improves 3D segmentation in both online (e.g., self-prompting)
and offline (e.g., contrastive lifting) settings, enabling applications such as
hierarchical segmentation, object extraction, and scene editing.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient characterization of nanoparticle morphology in
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images is critical for ensuring product
quality in nanomaterial synthesis and accelerating development. However,
conventional deep learning methods for shape classification require extensive
labeled datasets and computationally demanding training, limiting their
accessibility to the typical nanoparticle practitioner in research and
industrial settings. In this study, we introduce a zero-shot classification
pipeline that leverages two vision foundation models: the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) for object segmentation and DINOv2 for feature embedding. By
combining these models with a lightweight classifier, we achieve high-precision
shape classification across three morphologically diverse nanoparticle datasets
- without the need for extensive parameter fine-tuning. Our methodology
outperforms a fine-tuned YOLOv11 and ChatGPT o4-mini-high baselines,
demonstrating robustness to small datasets, subtle morphological variations,
and domain shifts from natural to scientific imaging. Quantitative clustering
metrics on PCA plots of the DINOv2 features are discussed as a means of
assessing the progress of the chemical synthesis. This work highlights the
potential of foundation models to advance automated microscopy image analysis,
offering an alternative to traditional deep learning pipelines in nanoparticle
research which is both more efficient and more accessible to the user.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有化妆数据集采集困难，合成方法存在失真或一致性差的问题，需要高质量配对数据支持美容相关任务。

Method: 基于FFHQ数据集，改进化妆迁移方法，分离身份与化妆风格，生成18K身份与5种化妆风格的90K配对图像。

Result: 构建了首个专注于化妆的高质量数据集FFHQ-Makeup，包含90K配对图像，保持身份和表情一致性。

Conclusion: FFHQ-Makeup填补了高质量化妆数据集的空白，为美容相关研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Paired bare-makeup facial images are essential for a wide range of
beauty-related tasks, such as virtual try-on, facial privacy protection, and
facial aesthetics analysis. However, collecting high-quality paired makeup
datasets remains a significant challenge. Real-world data acquisition is
constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while
existing synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or
inconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods
typically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often
distort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and
text-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression,
undermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality
synthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles
while preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon
the diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from
existing datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup
transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired
with 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality
bare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that
FFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets
and serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对视觉语言模型（VLMs）的重要性感知后训练量化框架VLMQ，解决了现有方法因模态差异导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Hessian-based LLM PTQ方法在VLMs中因忽视视觉和文本令牌的差异而表现不佳。

Method: VLMQ通过优化重要性感知目标生成增强的Hessian矩阵，并利用轻量级块级反向传播计算令牌重要性因子。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，VLMQ在低比特量化下表现优异，如2比特量化下MME-RealWorld任务提升16.45%。

Conclusion: VLMQ为VLMs提供了一种高效且有效的量化方法，显著提升了低比特量化性能。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for
compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining.
While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models
(LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.},
limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs.
However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during
quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs.
Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ
framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token
redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an
enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining
compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and
effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise
backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations.
Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit
settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement
on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单视角或后处理单视角姿态无法解决的姿态模糊问题，提出一种更可靠的多视角方法。

Method: 利用视线从相机中心出发的多视角几何建模，假设相机内部和相对方向已知但可变化，实现端到端训练。

Result: 在合成数据集上优于单视角和现有多视角方法，在YCB-V数据集上表现竞争性。

Conclusion: MVTOP是一种无需额外数据（如深度）的端到端可训练方法，能可靠解决姿态模糊问题。

Abstract: We present MVTOP, a novel transformer-based method for multi-view rigid
object pose estimation. Through an early fusion of the view-specific features,
our method can resolve pose ambiguities that would be impossible to solve with
a single view or with a post-processing of single-view poses. MVTOP models the
multi-view geometry via lines of sight that emanate from the respective camera
centers. While the method assumes the camera interior and relative orientations
are known for a particular scene, they can vary for each inference. This makes
the method versatile. The use of the lines of sight enables MVTOP to correctly
predict the correct pose with the merged multi-view information. To show the
model's capabilities, we provide a synthetic data set that can only be solved
with such holistic multi-view approaches since the poses in the dataset cannot
be solved with just one view. Our method outperforms single-view and all
existing multi-view approaches on our dataset and achieves competitive results
on the YCB-V dataset. To the best of our knowledge, no holistic multi-view
method exists that can resolve such pose ambiguities reliably. Our model is
end-to-end trainable and does not require any additional data, e.g., depth.

Conclusion: 轻量级设计使其可嵌入事件相机或作为高效前端预处理模块。

Abstract: Event cameras offer unparalleled advantages such as high temporal resolution,
low latency, and high dynamic range. However, their limited spatial resolution
poses challenges for fine-grained perception tasks. In this work, we propose an
ultra-lightweight, stream-based event-to-event super-resolution method based on
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), designed for real-time deployment on
resource-constrained devices. To further reduce model size, we introduce a
novel Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding strategy that decouples
positive and negative events into separate forward paths through a shared SNN.
Furthermore, we propose a Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss
(LearnSTPLoss) that adaptively balances temporal, spatial, and polarity
consistency using learnable uncertainty-based weights. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive super-resolution performance
on multiple datasets while significantly reducing model size and inference
time. The lightweight design enables embedding the module into event cameras or
using it as an efficient front-end preprocessing for downstream vision tasks.

Abstract: Personalized generation in T2I diffusion models aims to naturally incorporate

with a transformer-based adapter to enable personalized generation through
condition-level modeling in the latent space. DrUM demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets and seamlessly integrates with open-source
text encoders, making it compatible with widely used foundation T2I models
without requiring additional fine-tuning.

Conclusion: RSDNet通过单步推理和多级噪声处理，实现了高效且鲁棒的3D目标检测。

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have shown success in robust
3D object detection tasks. Existing methods often rely on the score matching
from 3D boxes or pre-trained diffusion priors. However, they typically require
multi-step iterations in inference, which limits efficiency. To address this,
we propose a \textbf{R}obust single-stage fully \textbf{S}parse 3D object
\textbf{D}etection \textbf{Net}work with a Detachable Latent Framework (DLF) of
DDPMs, named RSDNet. Specifically, RSDNet learns the denoising process in
latent feature spaces through lightweight denoising networks like multi-level
denoising autoencoders (DAEs). This enables RSDNet to effectively understand
scene distributions under multi-level perturbations, achieving robust and
reliable detection. Meanwhile, we reformulate the noising and denoising
mechanisms of DDPMs, enabling DLF to construct multi-type and multi-level noise
samples and targets, enhancing RSDNet robustness to multiple perturbations.
Furthermore, a semantic-geometric conditional guidance is introduced to
perceive the object boundaries and shapes, alleviating the center feature
missing problem in sparse representations, enabling RSDNet to perform in a
fully sparse detection pipeline. Moreover, the detachable denoising network
design of DLF enables RSDNet to perform single-step detection in inference,
further enhancing detection efficiency. Extensive experiments on public
benchmarks show that RSDNet can outperform existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art detection.

Abstract: Internet memes, now a staple of digital communication, play a pivotal role in
how users engage within online communities and allow researchers to gain
insight into contemporary digital culture. These engaging user-generated
content are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other
memes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called
Meme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,
most existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual
background, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme
matching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude
the many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of
automated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to
contemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader
formulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show
that conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise
computation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes
but fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the
segment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image
measures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a
prompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for
meme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared
visual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that
requires more sophisticated matching techniques.

Conclusion: ReDPO和V.I.P.框架能高效生成高质量视频，代码和视频已开源。

Abstract: With growing interest in deploying text-to-video (T2V) models in
resource-constrained environments, reducing their high computational cost has
become crucial, leading to extensive research on pruning and knowledge
distillation methods while maintaining performance. However, existing
distillation methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which
often leads to mode collapse as pruned models with reduced capacity fail to
directly match the teacher's outputs, ultimately resulting in degraded quality.
To address this challenge, we propose an effective distillation method, ReDPO,
that integrates DPO and SFT. Our approach leverages DPO to guide the student
model to focus on recovering only the targeted properties, rather than
passively imitating the teacher, while also utilizing SFT to enhance overall
performance. We additionally propose V.I.P., a novel framework for filtering
and curating high-quality pair datasets, along with a step-by-step online
approach for calibrated training. We validate our method on two leading T2V
models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2%

*Gang Dai,Yifan Zhang,Yutao Qin,Qiangya Guo,Shuangping Huang,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffBrush是一种基于扩散模型的新方法，用于生成手写文本行，专注于风格模仿和内容准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手写文本生成方法主要关注孤立单词，而真实手写文本需要关注单词间的关系（如垂直对齐和水平间距）。生成整行文本是更全面且具挑战性的任务。

Method: DiffBrush通过内容解耦风格学习和多尺度内容学习实现：1）使用列和行掩码分离风格与内容；2）通过行和单词判别器确保全局连贯性和局部准确性。

Result: 实验表明，DiffBrush在风格再现和内容保留方面表现优异，能生成高质量文本行。

Conclusion: DiffBrush为手写文本行生成提供了有效解决方案，尤其在风格和内容准确性上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Existing handwritten text generation methods primarily focus on isolated
words. However, realistic handwritten text demands attention not only to
individual words but also to the relationships between them, such as vertical
alignment and horizontal spacing. Therefore, generating entire text lines
emerges as a more promising and comprehensive task. However, this task poses
significant challenges, including the accurate modeling of complex style
patterns encompassing both intra- and inter-word relationships, and maintaining
content accuracy across numerous characters. To address these challenges, we
propose DiffBrush, a novel diffusion-based model for handwritten text-line
generation. Unlike existing methods, DiffBrush excels in both style imitation
and content accuracy through two key strategies: (1) content-decoupled style
learning, which disentangles style from content to better capture intra-word
and inter-word style patterns by using column- and row-wise masking; and (2)
multi-scale content learning, which employs line and word discriminators to
ensure global coherence and local accuracy of textual content. Extensive
experiments show that DiffBrush excels in generating high-quality text lines,
particularly in style reproduction and content preservation. Code is available

Motivation: 现有方法将动词和名词组件视为独立分类任务，忽略了它们之间的语义和上下文关系，导致表示碎片化和泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出EgoPrompt框架，通过统一提示池空间和注意力机制实现动词和名词组件的交互，并引入多样化池标准优化提示池。

Result: 在Ego4D、EPIC-Kitchens和EGTEA数据集上的实验表明，EgoPrompt在跨数据集和基础到新泛化基准上均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: EgoPrompt通过建模动词和名词组件的关系，显著提升了第一人称动作识别的性能，证明了其方法的有效性。

Abstract: Driven by the increasing demand for applications in augmented and virtual
reality, egocentric action recognition has emerged as a prominent research
area. It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed
behavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon
(i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most
existing approaches treat these two components as independent classification
tasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking
their inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented
representations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these
challenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct
the egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting
strategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified
Prompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component
representations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and
nouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair
form. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an
attention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure
the prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training
objective, Diverse Pool Criteria. This objective realizes our goals from two
perspectives: Prompt Selection Frequency Regularization and Prompt Knowledge
Orthogonalization. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Ego4D,
EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA datasets. The results consistently show that EgoPrompt
achieves state-of-the-art performance across within-dataset, cross-dataset, and
base-to-novel generalization benchmarks.

Conclusion: EmmPD框架有效平衡了计算效率和特征保留，提升了胎盘疾病的诊断准确性。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of placental diseases via whole slide images (WSIs) is
critical for preventing severe maternal and fetal complications. However, WSI
analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive data
volume. Existing WSI classification methods encounter critical limitations: (1)
inadequate patch selection strategies that either compromise performance or
fail to sufficiently reduce computational demands, and (2) the loss of global
histological context resulting from patch-level processing approaches. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient multimodal framework for
Patient-level placental disease Diagnosis, named EmmPD. Our approach introduces
a two-stage patch selection module that combines parameter-free and learnable
compression strategies, optimally balancing computational efficiency with
critical feature preservation. Additionally, we develop a hybrid multimodal
fusion module that leverages adaptive graph learning to enhance pathological
feature representation and incorporates textual medical reports to enrich
global contextual understanding. Extensive experiments conducted on both a
self-constructed patient-level Placental dataset and two public datasets
demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance.

Conclusion: SDGPA通过合成数据生成和渐进适应策略有效解决了零样本域自适应语义分割问题。

Abstract: Deep learning-based semantic segmentation models achieve impressive results
yet remain limited in handling distribution shifts between training and test
data. In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and
Progressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive
semantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text
description of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the
lack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf
text-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring
source domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images
introduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images
cannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic
data, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches
individually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial
precision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented
intermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more
stable model adaptation to the target domain. Additionally, to mitigate the
impact of noise in synthetic data, we design a progressive adaptation strategy,
ensuring robust learning throughout the training process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
semantic segmentation. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法因传感器数据稀疏和缺乏不平坦地形数据集，在姿态估计和全局位移预测上表现不佳。

Method: 利用智能手机和智能手表的气压计数据估计高度变化，提出局部大腿坐标系以分离局部和全局运动。

Result: 在公开基准和真实场景中，BaroPoser优于仅使用IMU的现有方法。

Conclusion: BaroPoser通过结合气压计数据，显著提升了不平坦地形下的人体运动追踪性能。

Abstract: In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such
as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due
to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human
motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose
estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat
terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines
IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate
human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric
readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for
both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global
translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh
coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose
representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark
datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.

Abstract: Object detection has achieved remarkable accuracy through deep learning, yet
these improvements often come with increased computational cost, limiting
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Knowledge Distillation (KD)
provides an effective solution by enabling compact student models to learn from
larger teacher models. However, adapting KD to object detection poses unique
challenges due to its dual objectives-classification and localization-as well
as foreground-background imbalance and multi-scale feature representation. This
review introduces a novel architecture-centric taxonomy for KD methods,
distinguishing between CNN-based detectors (covering backbone-level,
neck-level, head-level, and RPN/RoI-level distillation) and Transformer-based
detectors (including query-level, feature-level, and logit-level distillation).
We further evaluate representative methods using the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC
datasets with mAP@0.5 as performance metric, providing a comparative analysis
of their effectiveness. The proposed taxonomy and analysis aim to clarify the
evolving landscape of KD in object detection, highlight current challenges, and
guide future research toward efficient and scalable detection systems.

Conclusion: 这是首个将生物启发的异步sigma-delta编码和事件驱动处理框架应用于雷达手势识别的研究，显著降低了功耗和计算需求。

Abstract: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand
gesture recognition (HGR) using an event-driven architecture inspired by
biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a
custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals
into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding.
These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on
a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring
spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that
continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when
meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and
computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from
seven users, our system achieves > 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous
sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based
HGR.

Conclusion: MMPL框架有效解决了长视频生成中的时间漂移和并行化问题，提升了生成效果。

Abstract: Current autoregressive diffusion models excel at video generation but are
generally limited to short temporal durations. Our theoretical analysis
indicates that the autoregressive modeling typically suffers from temporal
drift caused by error accumulation and hinders parallelization in long video
synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
planning-then-populating framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)
for long video generation. MMPL sketches a global storyline for the entire
video through two hierarchical stages: Micro Planning and Macro Planning.
Specifically, Micro Planning predicts a sparse set of future keyframes within
each short video segment, offering motion and appearance priors to guide
high-quality video segment generation. Macro Planning extends the in-segment
keyframes planning across the entire video through an autoregressive chain of
micro plans, ensuring long-term consistency across video segments.
Subsequently, MMPL-based Content Populating generates all intermediate frames
in parallel across segments, enabling efficient parallelization of
autoregressive generation. The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive
Workload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive
video generation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms
existing long video generation models in quality and stability. Generated
videos and comparison results are in our project page.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在恢复暗图像细节时效果不佳，限制了文本和边缘检测等下游应用。

Method: 第一阶段使用残差傅里叶引导模块（RFGM）恢复全局光照；第二阶段通过Patch Mamba和Grad Mamba细化纹理结构。

Result: 在多个基准数据集和下游应用中显著提升了细节恢复性能，且模块轻量高效。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了暗图像细节恢复问题，并可无缝集成到现有框架中。

Abstract: Recovering fine-grained details in extremely dark images remains challenging
due to severe structural information loss and noise corruption. Existing
enhancement methods often fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges,
limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications like text and edge
detection. To address these deficiencies, we propose an efficient dual-stage
approach centered on detail recovery for dark images. In the first stage, we
introduce a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) that effectively restores
global illumination in the frequency domain. RFGM captures inter-stage and
inter-channel dependencies through residual connections, providing robust
priors for high-fidelity frequency processing while mitigating error
accumulation risks from unreliable priors. The second stage employs
complementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure
refinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled
patches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained
details without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on
high-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and
prioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and downstream applications
demonstrate that our method significantly improves detail recovery performance
while maintaining efficiency. Crucially, the proposed modules are lightweight
and can be seamlessly integrated into existing Fourier-based frameworks with
minimal computational overhead. Code is available at

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视频问答（Video-QA）中因高令牌成本受限，且现有关键帧选择方法存在时间冗余问题。

Method: 采用自适应分层聚类算法在融合特征空间中识别并合并冗余帧，辅以轻量级文本语义图补充信息。

Result: 实验显示，AFP方法将所需帧数减少86.9%，输入令牌减少83.2%，同时提高准确性。

Conclusion: AFP方法通过高效剪枝和补充上下文，显著提升视频问答的效率和性能。

Abstract: The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to
Video Question Answering (Video-QA) is severely hindered by the high token cost
of processing numerous video frames. While increasing the number of sampled
frames is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon where
excessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution.
Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective,
still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To
address these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel
post-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP
employs an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and
CLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single
representatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a
lightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with
minimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
and VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach
demonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total
input tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality
set of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves
accuracy over baselines that use more frames. The code will be released upon
publication.

Motivation: 夜间图像因低光导致内容感知困难，现有方法缺乏解释性或依赖不可靠的先验，物理方法则简化假设不适用于复杂场景。

Result: 该方法通过因果干预和代码本匹配，显著提升了低光图像的增强效果和泛化能力。

Conclusion: CIVQLLIE通过离散表示学习和因果干预，为低光图像增强提供了可靠且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Images captured in nighttime scenes suffer from severely reduced visibility,
hindering effective content perception. Current low-light image enhancement
(LLIE) methods face significant challenges: data-driven end-to-end mapping
networks lack interpretability or rely on unreliable prior guidance, struggling
under extremely dark conditions, while physics-based methods depend on
simplified assumptions that often fail in complex real-world scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that
leverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal
reasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps
continuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from
large-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior,
encoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of
degradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to
distribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook.
Therefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to
systematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level
Causal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with
the brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a
Feature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective
Attention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by
illumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while
enhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible
feature-level intervention. Finally, during decoding, the High-frequency Detail
Reconstruction Module (HDRM) leverages structural information preserved in the
matched codebook representations to reconstruct fine details using deformable
convolution techniques.

Motivation: 现有方法在匹配3D运动与文本时忽略了人体结构的复杂性和时空动态性，导致语义对齐不精确。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上，Rsum分别提升了17.0%和18.2%，优于现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: WaMo通过细粒度特征提取和时空信息保留，显著提升了文本-运动检索的性能。

Abstract: Text-Motion Retrieval (TMR) aims to retrieve 3D motion sequences semantically
relevant to text descriptions. However, matching 3D motions with text remains
highly challenging, primarily due to the intricate structure of human body and
its spatial-temporal dynamics. Existing approaches often overlook these
complexities, relying on general encoding methods that fail to distinguish
different body parts and their dynamics, limiting precise semantic alignment.
To address this, we propose WaMo, a novel wavelet-based multi-frequency feature
extraction framework. It fully captures part-specific and time-varying motion
details across multiple resolutions on body joints, extracting discriminative
motion features to achieve fine-grained alignment with texts. WaMo has three
key components: (1) Trajectory Wavelet Decomposition decomposes motion signals
into frequency components that preserve both local kinematic details and global
motion semantics. (2) Trajectory Wavelet Reconstruction uses learnable inverse
wavelet transforms to reconstruct original joint trajectories from extracted
features, ensuring the preservation of essential spatial-temporal information.
(3) Disordered Motion Sequence Prediction reorders shuffled motion sequences to
improve the learning of inherent temporal coherence, enhancing motion-text
alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate WaMo's superiority, achieving
17.0\% and 18.2\% improvements in $Rsum$ on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Motivation: 随着模型规模增大，传统联邦学习在客户端设备上的计算资源需求过高，FedPromo旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：服务器端知识蒸馏对齐大模型与小模型表示，客户端训练轻量级分类器并聚合。

Result: 在五个图像分类基准测试中，FedPromo表现优于现有方法，适用于资源有限的客户端。

Conclusion: FedPromo在性能、隐私和资源效率之间取得了平衡，为多领域学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an established paradigm for training deep learning
models on decentralized data. However, as the size of the models grows,
conventional FL approaches often require significant computational resources on
client devices, which may not be feasible. We introduce FedPromo, a novel
framework that enables efficient adaptation of large-scale foundation models
stored on a central server to new domains encountered only by remote clients.
Instead of directly training the large model on client devices, FedPromo
optimizes lightweight proxy models via FL, significantly reducing computational
overhead while maintaining privacy. Our method follows a two-stage process:
first, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a
large-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact
counterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to
client devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally. These
classifiers are subsequently aggregated and seamlessly transferred back to the

access to user data. Through novel regularization strategies, our framework
enables decentralized multi-domain learning, balancing performance, privacy,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的图像修复方法存在高推理成本和适应性不足的问题，需要改进。

Method: 引入多退化特征调制和参数高效的低秩适应，结合高保真细节增强模块，优化Stable Diffusion模型。

Result: 实验表明，DOD在视觉质量和推理效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DOD方法高效且性能优越，适用于多种退化类型的图像修复。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revealed powerful potential in all-in-one image
restoration (AiOIR), which is talented in generating abundant texture details.
The existing AiOIR methods either retrain a diffusion model or fine-tune the
pretrained diffusion model with extra conditional guidance. However, they often
suffer from high inference costs and limited adaptability to diverse
degradation types. In this paper, we propose an efficient AiOIR method,
Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), which aims to achieve superior restoration
performance with only one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion (SD) models.
Specifically, multi-degradation feature modulation is first introduced to
capture different degradation prompts with a pretrained diffusion model. Then,
parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation integrates the prompts to
enable the fine-tuning of the SD model for adapting to different degradation
types. Besides, a high-fidelity detail enhancement module is integrated into
the decoder of SD to improve structural and textural details. Experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based restoration
approaches in both visual quality and inference efficiency.

TL;DR: GRASP是一种模块化框架，通过伪标签整合和特征对齐，利用现有解剖分割模型增强病理分割模型，无需重新训练解剖组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法忽视解剖背景，而放射科医生依赖解剖知识准确识别病理。GRASP旨在填补这一差距。

Method: GRASP通过伪标签输入通道和基于变换器的解剖特征融合，将解剖背景整合到病理分割模型中。

Result: 在多个评估指标和架构中，GRASP表现优异，其双解剖注入策略有效结合了解剖背景。

Conclusion: GRASP成功地将解剖知识整合到病理分割中，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Radiologists rely on anatomical understanding to accurately delineate
pathologies, yet most current deep learning approaches use pure pattern
recognition and ignore the anatomical context in which pathologies develop. To
narrow this gap, we introduce GRASP (Guided Representation Alignment for the
Segmentation of Pathologies), a modular plug-and-play framework that enhances
pathology segmentation models by leveraging existing anatomy segmentation
models through pseudolabel integration and feature alignment. Unlike previous
approaches that obtain anatomical knowledge via auxiliary training, GRASP
integrates into standard pathology optimization regimes without retraining
anatomical components. We evaluate GRASP on two PET/CT datasets, conduct
systematic ablation studies, and investigate the framework's inner workings. We
find that GRASP consistently achieves top rankings across multiple evaluation
metrics and diverse architectures. The framework's dual anatomy injection
strategy, combining anatomical pseudo-labels as input channels with
transformer-guided anatomical feature fusion, effectively incorporates
anatomical context.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GaitAdapter的持续步态识别方法，通过非重放学习和图神经网络提升模型在新任务中的识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有步态识别方法在新数据集上需要重新训练且难以保留旧知识的问题。

Method: 结合GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge模块和Euclidean Distance Stability Method，利用图神经网络和负样本对提升特征区分性。

Result: GaitAdapter显著优于其他方法，能有效保留多任务中的步态知识。

Conclusion: GaitAdapter为持续步态识别提供了有效解决方案，具有优越的判别能力。

Abstract: Current gait recognition methodologies generally necessitate retraining when
encountering new datasets. Nevertheless, retrained models frequently encounter
difficulties in preserving knowledge from previous datasets, leading to a
significant decline in performance on earlier test sets. To tackle these
challenges, we present a continual gait recognition task, termed GaitAdapt,
which supports the progressive enhancement of gait recognition capabilities
over time and is systematically categorized according to various evaluation
scenarios. Additionally, we propose GaitAdapter, a non-replay continual
learning approach for gait recognition. This approach integrates the
GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge (GPAK) module, employing graph neural networks
to aggregate common gait patterns from current data into a repository
constructed from graph vectors. Subsequently, this repository is used to
improve the discriminability of gait features in new tasks, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to effectively recognize gait patterns. We also introduce a
Euclidean Distance Stability Method (EDSN) based on negative pairs, which
ensures that newly added gait samples from different classes maintain similar
relative spatial distributions across both previous and current gait tasks,
thereby alleviating the impact of task changes on the distinguishability of
original domain features. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that GaitAdapter
effectively retains gait knowledge acquired from diverse tasks, exhibiting
markedly superior discriminative capability compared to alternative methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCFlow提出了一种通过可逆合并风格与内容的方法，避免显式解耦的挑战，并在零样本任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉模型中风格与内容的显式解耦因语义重叠和主观性而困难，现有方法难以解决固有模糊性。

Method: SCFlow采用流匹配框架，学习双向映射，通过合成数据集训练风格与内容的可逆合并。

Result: SCFlow在ImageNet-1k和WikiArt的零样本任务中表现优异，证明解耦自然涌现。

Conclusion: 可逆合并风格与内容的方法能自然实现解耦，且具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Explicitly disentangling style and content in vision models remains
challenging due to their semantic overlap and the subjectivity of human
perception. Existing methods propose separation through generative or
discriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of
disentangling intertwined concepts. Instead, we ask: Can we bypass explicit
disentanglement by learning to merge style and content invertibly, allowing
separation to emerge naturally? We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework
that learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled
representations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training
solely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible
disentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on
arbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion
models and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51
styles $\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement
through systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks,
we demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot
settings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that
disentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为NAVIA的方法，通过信息增强中和令牌聚合，以在减少推理延迟的同时保持测试时适应（TTA）的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA方法在资源受限场景下计算开销大，且令牌聚合方法直接集成会导致性能下降。

Method: 提出NAVIA方法，通过增强[CLS]令牌嵌入和在浅层引入自适应偏置，优化信息损失。

Result: NAVIA在多个分布外基准测试中性能提升2.5%以上，推理延迟减少20%以上。

Conclusion: NAVIA有效解决了高效测试时适应（ETTA）问题，平衡了性能和效率。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution for adapting
Vision Transformers (ViT) to distribution shifts without additional training
data. However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational
overhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world
scenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods
merge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit
efficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly
integrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of
TTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a
theoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that
token aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully
mitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods. Guided by this
insight, we propose to \textbf{N}eutralize Token \textbf{A}ggregation
\textbf{v}ia \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{NAVIA}).
Specifically, we directly augment the [CLS] token embedding and incorporate
adaptive biases into the [CLS] token in shallow layers of ViTs. We
theoretically demonstrate that these augmentations, when optimized via entropy
minimization, recover the information lost due to token aggregation. Extensive
experiments across various out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that
NAVIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5\%, while
achieving an inference latency reduction of more than 20\%, effectively
addressing the ETTA challenge.

TL;DR: MACT是一个多智能体协作框架，通过测试时扩展和混合奖励建模，显著提升了视觉文档理解和视觉问答任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在参数规模、自我纠正能力和复杂推理任务上表现不足，尤其是在长视觉上下文和文档任务中。

Method: MACT包含四个小规模智能体（规划、执行、判断和回答），通过混合奖励建模和智能体级测试时扩展优化协作。

Result: MACT在15个基准测试中的13个领先，且在长视觉上下文和复杂推理任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: MACT以较小参数规模实现了高性能，为视觉语言任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs), whether generalists or specialists,
remain constrained by their parameter scale, lack robust self-correction
capabilities, and underperform in tasks involving long visual contexts and
complex reasoning, resulting in suboptimal performance on document-based tasks.
To address this, we propose MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with
Test-Time scaling, tailored for visual document understanding and visual
question answering (VQA). It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e.,
planning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles
and effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies
correctness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming
conventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries
of the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific
abilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time
scaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on
their functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and
non-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller
parameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical
tasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts
and complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top
three positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D剪影和骨架方法在视角变化和细节捕捉上表现不足，需更丰富的模态提升识别能力。

Method: 利用RGB图像序列估计深度图作为新模态，并开发多尺度跨级融合方案以弥合深度图与剪影的模态差异。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，DepthGait达到最先进性能，并在挑战性数据集中取得高排名1准确率。

Conclusion: DepthGait通过引入深度图和融合策略，显著提升了步态识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Robust gait recognition requires highly discriminative representations, which
are closely tied to input modalities. While binary silhouettes and skeletons
have dominated recent literature, these 2D representations fall short of
capturing sufficient cues that can be exploited to handle viewpoint variations,
and capture finer and meaningful details of gait. In this paper, we introduce a
novel framework, termed DepthGait, that incorporates RGB-derived depth maps and
silhouettes for enhanced gait recognition. Specifically, apart from the 2D
silhouette representation of the human body, the proposed pipeline explicitly
estimates depth maps from a given RGB image sequence and uses them as a new
modality to capture discriminative features inherent in human locomotion. In
addition, a novel multi-scale and cross-level fusion scheme has also been
developed to bridge the modality gap between depth maps and silhouettes.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed
DepthGait achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to peer methods and
attains an impressive mean rank-1 accuracy on the challenging datasets.

Motivation: 解决无监督视频分割任务中缺乏监督信号和视觉场景复杂性的挑战。

Method: 通过余弦相似度对齐教师和学生模型的槽位，无需额外蒸馏目标或辅助监督。

Result: 学生模型在参数减少3.6倍、速度提升1.9倍的情况下，性能匹配甚至超过教师模型。

Conclusion: SlotMatch框架简单高效，学生模型性能优于现有无监督视频分割模型。

Abstract: Unsupervised video segmentation is a challenging computer vision task,
especially due to the lack of supervisory signals coupled with the complexity
of visual scenes. To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on
slot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural
architectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation
framework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a
lightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns
corresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no
additional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of
SlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating
that integrating additional losses is redundant. We conduct experiments on two
datasets to compare the state-of-the-art teacher model, SlotContrast, with our
distilled student. The results show that our student based on SlotMatch matches
and even outperforms its teacher, while using 3.6x less parameters and running
1.9x faster. Moreover, our student surpasses previous unsupervised video
segmentation models.

Result: 实验表明STVMLU优于其他算法。

Conclusion: STVMLU方法有效提升了高光谱图像解混的精度。

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing aims at estimating material signatures (known as
endmembers) and the corresponding proportions (referred to abundances), which
is a critical preprocessing step in various hyperspectral imagery applications.
This study develops a novel approach called sparsity and total variation (TV)
constrained multilayer linear unmixing (STVMLU) for hyperspectral imagery.
Specifically, based on a multilayer matrix factorization model, to improve the
accuracy of unmixing, a TV constraint is incorporated to consider adjacent
spatial similarity. Additionally, a L1/2-norm sparse constraint is adopted to
effectively characterize the sparsity of the abundance matrix. For optimizing
the STVMLU model, the method of alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is employed, which allows for the simultaneous extraction of endmembers
and their corresponding abundance matrix. Experimental results illustrate the
enhanced performance of the proposed STVMLU when compared to other algorithms.

Abstract: X-ray medical report generation is one of the important applications of
artificial intelligence in healthcare. With the support of large foundation
models, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved.
However, challenges such as hallucination and weak disease diagnostic
capability still persist. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale
multi-modal medical knowledge graph (termed M3KG) based on the ground truth
medical report using the GPT-4o. It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of
relations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert
Plus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs
and use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we
adopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the
knowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and
retrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention.
Finally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph,
input X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of
our proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework. The source

Conclusion: IMAC通过时空信号对齐和分离建模，有效解决跨域EEG数据偏移，具有高灵活性和适应性。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges
due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode
configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across
domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and
imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of
cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To
address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC
first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional
unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations.
Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods,
IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a
channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high
resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach
simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal
instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for
robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a
disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial
information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity
while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across
10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance,
achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and
cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under
both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods
by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification
accuracy.

Result: 实验表明，VideoGuard的保护性能优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: VideoGuard有效解决了视频内容保护不足的问题，为视频安全提供了新方案。

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative technology, current generative
models can generate high-fidelity digital content and edit it in a controlled
manner. However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these
capabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has
attempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative
models, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to
video content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named
VideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious
editing. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly
unnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended
generative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and
inter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying
image-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield
video from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint
frame optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.
Furthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization
objectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce
outputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to
optimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and
subjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results
show that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the
baseline methods.

Motivation: 冷启动主动学习（CSAL）在医学图像分析中缺乏先验知识时选择信息样本，现有方法依赖自监督学习（SSL）效率低且特征表示不足，预训练基础模型（FMs）潜力未被充分探索。

Method: 提出MedCAL-Bench基准测试，评估14种FMs和7种CSAL策略在7个数据集上的表现，涵盖分类和分割任务，并首次同时评估特征提取和样本选择阶段。

Result: 1）多数FMs对CSAL有效，DINO家族在分割任务中表现最佳；2）分割任务中FMs性能差异大，分类任务差异小；3）不同数据集需不同样本选择策略，ALPS在分割中最佳，RepDiv在分类中领先。

Conclusion: MedCAL-Bench为FM在CSAL中的应用提供了系统评估，揭示了FMs的潜力和不同策略的适用性，推动了医学图像分析中CSAL的发展。

Abstract: Cold-Start Active Learning (CSAL) aims to select informative samples for
annotation without prior knowledge, which is important for improving annotation
efficiency and model performance under a limited annotation budget in medical
image analysis. Most existing CSAL methods rely on Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL) on the target dataset for feature extraction, which is inefficient and
limited by insufficient feature representation. Recently, pre-trained
Foundation Models (FMs) have shown powerful feature extraction ability with a
potential for better CSAL. However, this paradigm has been rarely investigated,
with a lack of benchmarks for comparison of FMs in CSAL tasks. To this end, we
propose MedCAL-Bench, the first systematic FM-based CSAL benchmark for medical
image analysis. We evaluate 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets
under different annotation budgets, covering classification and segmentation
tasks from diverse medical modalities. It is also the first CSAL benchmark that
evaluates both the feature extraction and sample selection stages. Our
experimental results reveal that: 1) Most FMs are effective feature extractors
for CSAL, with DINO family performing the best in segmentation; 2) The
performance differences of these FMs are large in segmentation tasks, while
small for classification; 3) Different sample selection strategies should be
considered in CSAL on different datasets, with Active Learning by Processing
Surprisal (ALPS) performing the best in segmentation while RepDiv leading for
classification. The code is available at

Result: 发现模型输出中存在与人口统计相关的视觉模式，部分模型多样性不足加剧了差异。

Conclusion: SODA框架为检测生成模型中的偏见提供了实用方法，是迈向更负责任AI开发的重要一步。

Abstract: While prior research on text-to-image generation has predominantly focused on
biases in human depictions, we investigate a more subtle yet pervasive
phenomenon: demographic bias in generated objects (e.g., cars). We introduce
SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for
systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes
of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those
from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art
models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories.
Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between
specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color
patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and
reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive
biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which
in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our
proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing
how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this
as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable progress in
image and video synthesis, with classifier-free guidance (CFG) becoming the
standard tool for high-fidelity, controllable generation. However, despite
their practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with
different stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step
regimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and
analyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely
sensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative
strength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is
intrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and
causes exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To
address this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive
guidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps
based on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method
is lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible
with standard flow frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image
(SD3.5, Lumina) and video (WAN2.1) models demonstrate that our approach enables
up to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality,
robustness, and semantic alignment. Extensive ablation studies further confirm
the generality and stability of our schedule across models, datasets, and
hyperparameters. Our findings highlight the critical role of stepwise guidance
adaptation in unlocking the full potential of fast flow-based generative
models.

Abstract: Recently, large pre-trained vision-language models have shown remarkable
performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). With fine-tuning on a single
auxiliary dataset, the model enables cross-category anomaly detection on
diverse datasets covering industrial defects and medical lesions. Compared to
manually designed prompts, prompt learning eliminates the need for expert
knowledge and trial-and-error. However, it still faces the following
challenges: (i) static learnable tokens struggle to capture the continuous and
diverse patterns of normal and anomalous states, limiting generalization to
unseen categories; (ii) fixed textual labels provide overly sparse category
information, making the model prone to overfitting to a specific semantic
subspace. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Prompt Synthesis
(CoPS), a novel framework that synthesizes dynamic prompts conditioned on
visual features to enhance ZSAD performance. Specifically, we extract
representative normal and anomaly prototypes from fine-grained patch features
and explicitly inject them into prompts, enabling adaptive state modeling.
Given the sparsity of class labels, we leverage a variational autoencoder to
model semantic image features and implicitly fuse varied class tokens into
prompts. Additionally, integrated with our spatially-aware alignment mechanism,
extensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS surpasses state-of-the-art methods
by 2.5% AUROC in both classification and segmentation across 13 industrial and
medical datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/cqylunlun/CoPS.

Abstract: Retinal microvascular imaging is increasingly recognised as a non invasive
method for evaluating systemic vascular and metabolic health. However, the
association between lipidomics and retinal vasculature remains inadequate. This
study investigates the relationships between serum lipid subclasses, free fatty
acids (FA), diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesteryl
esters (CE), and retinal microvascular characteristics in a large
population-based cohort. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we examined the
interconnection between lipid subclasses and ten retinal microvascular traits,
applying the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) to adjust for
statistical significance.
  Results indicated that FA were linked to retinal vessel twistiness, while CE
correlated with the average widths of arteries and veins. Conversely, DAG and
TAG showed negative correlations with the width and complexity of arterioles
and venules. These findings suggest that retinal vascular architecture reflects
distinct circulating lipid profiles, supporting its role as a non-invasive
marker of systemic metabolic health. This study is the first to integrate deep
learning (DL)derived retinal traits with lipidomic subclasses in a healthy
cohort, thereby providing insights into microvascular structural changes
independent of disease status or treatment effects.

Conclusion: 双摄像头框架有效解决了摩尔纹与真实纹理的区分问题，同时保持了色调和时间一致性。

Abstract: Moire patterns, unwanted color artifacts in images and videos, arise from the
interference between spatially high-frequency scene contents and the spatial
discrete sampling of digital cameras. Existing demoireing methods primarily
rely on single-camera image/video processing, which faces two critical
challenges: 1) distinguishing moire patterns from visually similar real
textures, and 2) preserving tonal consistency and temporal coherence while
removing moire artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a dual-camera
framework that captures synchronized videos of the same scene: one in focus
(retaining high-quality textures but may exhibit moire patterns) and one
defocused (with significantly reduced moire patterns but blurred textures). We
use the defocused video to help distinguish moire patterns from real texture,
so as to guide the demoireing of the focused video. We propose a frame-wise
demoireing pipeline, which begins with an optical flow based alignment step to
address any discrepancies in displacement and occlusion between the focused and
defocused frames. Then, we leverage the aligned defocused frame to guide the
demoireing of the focused frame using a multi-scale CNN and a multi-dimensional
training loss. To maintain tonal and temporal consistency, our final step
involves a joint bilateral filter to leverage the demoireing result from the
CNN as the guide to filter the input focused frame to obtain the final output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework largely
outperforms state-of-the-art image and video demoireing methods.

Result: MetaScope在金属透镜分割和恢复任务中优于现有方法，并在真实生物医学场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: MetaScope填补了金属透镜内窥镜的研究空白，为微米级成像提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Miniaturized endoscopy has advanced accurate visual perception within the
human body. Prevailing research remains limited to conventional cameras
employing convex lenses, where the physical constraints with millimetre-scale
thickness impose serious impediments on the micro-level clinical. Recently,
with the emergence of meta-optics, ultra-micro imaging based on metalenses
(micron-scale) has garnered great attention, serving as a promising solution.
However, due to the physical difference of metalens, there is a large gap in
data acquisition and algorithm research. In light of this, we aim to bridge
this unexplored gap, advancing the novel metalens endoscopy. First, we
establish datasets for metalens endoscopy and conduct preliminary optical
simulation, identifying two derived optical issues that physically adhere to
strong optical priors. Second, we propose MetaScope, a novel optics-driven
neural network tailored for metalens endoscopy driven by physical optics.
MetaScope comprises two novel designs: Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment
(OIA), rectifying intensity decay by learning optical embeddings, and
Optics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), mitigating chromatic aberration by
learning spatial deformations informed by learned Point Spread Function (PSF)
distributions. To enhance joint learning, we further deploy a gradient-guided
distillation to transfer knowledge from the foundational model adaptively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaScope not only outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both metalens segmentation and restoration but also
achieves impressive generalized ability in real biomedical scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结肠镜视频的动态特性提供了更全面的视觉信息，但快速相机移动会引入背景噪声，增加误检风险，因此需要一种鲁棒的检测方法。

Method: AVPDN包含AFIA模块（三支架构，结合密集和稀疏自注意力及通道混洗）和SACI模块（利用不同感受野的扩张卷积捕获多尺度上下文信息）。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中，AVPDN表现出色，具有竞争性的视频息肉检测性能。

Conclusion: AVPDN通过自适应特征增强和多尺度上下文整合，显著提升了结肠镜视频中息肉的检测效果。

Abstract: Accurate detection of polyps is of critical importance for the early and
intermediate stages of colorectal cancer diagnosis. Compared to static images,
dynamic colonoscopy videos provide more comprehensive visual information, which
can facilitate the development of effective treatment plans. However, unlike
fixed-camera recordings, colonoscopy videos often exhibit rapid camera
movement, introducing substantial background noise that disrupts the structural
integrity of the scene and increases the risk of false positives. To address
these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Video Polyp Detection Network
(AVPDN), a robust framework for multi-scale polyp detection in colonoscopy
videos. AVPDN incorporates two key components: the Adaptive Feature Interaction
and Augmentation (AFIA) module and the Scale-Aware Context Integration (SACI)
module. The AFIA module adopts a triple-branch architecture to enhance feature
representation. It employs dense self-attention for global context modeling,
sparse self-attention to mitigate the influence of low query-key similarity in
feature aggregation, and channel shuffle operations to facilitate inter-branch
information exchange. In parallel, the SACI module is designed to strengthen
multi-scale feature integration. It utilizes dilated convolutions with varying
receptive fields to capture contextual information at multiple spatial scales,
thereby improving the model's denoising capability. Experiments conducted on
several challenging public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization ability of the proposed method, achieving competitive
performance in video-based polyp detection tasks.

Result: 实验证明IKOD能有效减少幻觉并提升模型性能，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: IKOD是一种轻量高效的解决方案，适用于多种LVLMs。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress across multiple domains. However, these models still face
the inherent challenge of integrating vision and language for collaborative
inference, which often leads to "hallucinations", outputs that are not grounded
in the corresponding images. Many efforts have been made to address these
issues, but each comes with its own limitations, such as high computational
cost or expensive dataset annotation. Recent research shows that LVLMs exhibit
a long-term bias where hallucinations increase as the sequence length grows,
yet the underlying cause remains poorly understood. Building on extensive
research into attention mechanisms in LVLMs, we analyze the relationship
between this long-term bias and visual attention. In our research, we identify
a consistent phenomenon in current LVLMs: the model's attention to visual input
diminishes as the generated sequence grows, which we hypothesize to be a key
factor contributing to observed increasing hallucinations. Based on these
insights, we propose Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative
Decoding (IKOD), a collaborative decoding strategy generating more
image-focused sequences. This method derives logits from shorter sequences with
higher image attention through key-value merging and combines them with those
from the original decoding, effectively mitigating attention degradation and
suppressing hallucinations while not incurring too much inference cost.
Extensive experiments on both hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks
demonstrate IKOD's superior effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and
improving comprehensive capacities for LVLMs. Importantly, IKOD requires no
additional training or external tools, making it a lightweight and efficient
framework applicable to various models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs)在文本到图像生成中表现优异，但其高计算成本和参数量在资源受限场景下难以应用。现有后训练量化方法在极端低比特设置下性能下降严重。

Method: 提出LRQ-DiT框架，包括Twin-Log量化（TLQ）以匹配权重分布，以及自适应旋转方案（ARS）以动态处理激活异常值。

Result: 在PixArt、FLUX等模型上验证，LRQ-DiT在低比特量化下保持图像质量，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: LRQ-DiT有效解决了DiT模型低比特量化的挑战，为资源受限场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved impressive performance in
text-to-image generation. However, their high computational cost and large
parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained
scenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce
memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from
severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two
key obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model
weights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform
quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;
(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated
values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in
specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these
issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We
introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with
the weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an
Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or
outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating
the impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX
under various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ,
and sDCI datasets. LRQ-DiT achieves low-bit quantization of DiT models while
preserving image quality, outperforming existing PTQ baselines.

Result: 实验证明ParticleSAM在定量和定性实验中优于原始SAM方法。

Conclusion: ParticleSAM在建筑材料质量监控及其他小颗粒分割领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: The construction industry represents a major sector in terms of resource
consumption. Recycled construction material has high reuse potential, but
quality monitoring of the aggregates is typically still performed with manual
methods. Vision-based machine learning methods could offer a faster and more
efficient solution to this problem, but existing segmentation methods are by
design not directly applicable to images with hundreds of small particles. In
this paper, we propose ParticleSAM, an adaptation of the segmentation
foundation model to images with small and dense objects such as the ones often
encountered in construction material particles. Moreover, we create a new dense
multi-particle dataset simulated from isolated particle images with the
assistance of an automated data generation and labeling pipeline. This dataset
serves as a benchmark for visual material quality control automation while our
segmentation approach has the potential to be valuable in application areas
beyond construction where small-particle segmentation is needed. Our
experimental results validate the advantages of our method by comparing to the
original SAM method both in quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Result: 不同优化方法导致不同的稀疏性水平，高稀疏性通常不会影响恢复质量。

Conclusion: 高稀疏性在SDL中是可行的，即使恢复图像与学习数据库差异较大。

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) is a fundamental technique that is useful
for many image processing tasks. As an example we consider here image recovery,
where SDL can be cast as a nonsmooth optimization problem. For this kind of
problems, iterative shrinkage methods represent a powerful class of algorithms
that are subject of ongoing research. Sparsity is an important property of the
learned solutions, as exactly the sparsity enables efficient further processing
or storage. The sparsity implies that a recovered image is determined as a
combination of a number of dictionary elements that is as low as possible.
Therefore, the question arises, to which degree sparsity should be enforced in
SDL in order to not compromise recovery quality. In this paper we focus on the
sparsity of solutions that can be obtained using a variety of optimization
methods. It turns out that there are different sparsity regimes depending on
the method in use. Furthermore, we illustrate that high sparsity does in
general not compromise recovery quality, even if the recovered image is quite
different from the learning database.

Result: 在多个数据集和任务中，PECM显著提升了检索精度和一致性，性能提升高达10.17%。

Conclusion: PECM有效处理了医学数据模糊性，提升了复杂临床场景下的检索可靠性，成为新的SOTA方法。

Abstract: In cross-modal retrieval tasks, such as image-to-report and report-to-image
retrieval, accurately aligning medical images with relevant text reports is
essential but challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and variability in
medical data. Existing models often struggle to capture the nuanced,
multi-level semantic relationships in radiology data, leading to unreliable
retrieval results. To address these issues, we propose the Prototype-Enhanced
Confidence Modeling (PECM) framework, which introduces multi-level prototypes
for each modality to better capture semantic variability and enhance retrieval
robustness. PECM employs a dual-stream confidence estimation that leverages
prototype similarity distributions and an adaptive weighting mechanism to
control the impact of high-uncertainty data on retrieval rankings. Applied to
radiology image-report datasets, our method achieves significant improvements
in retrieval precision and consistency, effectively handling data ambiguity and
advancing reliability in complex clinical scenarios. We report results on
multiple different datasets and tasks including fully supervised and zero-shot
retrieval obtaining performance gains of up to 10.17%, establishing in new
state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Instruction-based garment editing enables precise image modifications via
natural language, with broad applications in fashion design and customization.
Unlike general editing tasks, it requires understanding garment-specific
semantics and attribute dependencies. However, progress is limited by the
scarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is
costly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data
synthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise
instruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To
address these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a
garment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories
aligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced
and diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit
Score, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies
between garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during
construction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate
triplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the
first instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing. The

Conclusion: MAUP为跨域少样本医学图像分割提供了一种高效、无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-domain Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation (CD-FSMIS) is a potential
solution for segmenting medical images with limited annotation using knowledge
from other domains. The significant performance of current CD-FSMIS models
relies on the heavily training procedure over other source medical domains,
which degrades the universality and ease of model deployment. With the
development of large visual models of natural images, we propose a
training-free CD-FSMIS model that introduces the Multi-center Adaptive
Uncertainty-aware Prompting (MAUP) strategy for adapting the foundation model
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is trained with natural images, into the
CD-FSMIS task. To be specific, MAUP consists of three key innovations: (1)
K-means clustering based multi-center prompts generation for comprehensive
spatial coverage, (2) uncertainty-aware prompts selection that focuses on the
challenging regions, and (3) adaptive prompt optimization that can dynamically
adjust according to the target region complexity. With the pre-trained DINOv2
feature encoder, MAUP achieves precise segmentation results across three
medical datasets without any additional training compared with several
conventional CD-FSMIS models and training-free FSMIS model. The source code is

Conclusion: DKUA框架有效解决了LReID中的知识保留与适应问题，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) encounters a key challenge:
balancing the preservation of old knowledge with adaptation to new information.
Existing LReID methods typically employ knowledge distillation to enforce
representation alignment. However, these approaches ignore two crucial aspects:
specific distribution awareness and cross-domain unified knowledge learning,
both of which are essential for addressing this challenge. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and
association (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each
instance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a
distribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the
current domain into the domain-specific representations with the different
domain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples. Next,
we propose adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC) to dynamically generate the
unified representation as a cross-domain representation center. To further
mitigate forgetting, we develop a unified knowledge association (UKA)
mechanism, which explores the unified representation as a bridge to explicitly
model inter-domain associations, reducing inter-domain gaps. Finally,
distribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) is proposed to prevent the current
domain distribution from deviating from the cross-domain distribution center,
improving adaptation capacity. Experimental results show our DKUA outperforms
the existing methods by 7.6%/5.3% average mAP/R@1 improvement on
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity, respectively. Our code will be

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于视觉病理学基础模型的语义缝合方法（SemanticStitcher），用于自动拼接组织样本碎片，解决了传统边界形状匹配算法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织样本常因尺寸过大需拼接，但传统方法受组织损失、形态变形、染色不一致等问题限制，无法高效完成拼接。

Method: 利用视觉病理学基础模型的潜在特征表示识别碎片相邻区域，通过大量语义匹配候选进行鲁棒姿态估计，形成完整切片。

Result: 在三个病理学数据集上的实验表明，SemanticStitcher在正确边界匹配上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SemanticStitcher为组织样本拼接提供了更鲁棒和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In histopathology, tissue samples are often larger than a standard microscope
slide, making stitching of multiple fragments necessary to process entire
structures such as tumors. Automated stitching is a prerequisite for scaling
analysis, but is challenging due to possible tissue loss during preparation,
inhomogeneous morphological distortion, staining inconsistencies, missing
regions due to misalignment on the slide, or frayed tissue edges. This limits
state-of-the-art stitching methods using boundary shape matching algorithms to
reconstruct artificial whole mount slides (WMS). Here, we introduce
SemanticStitcher using latent feature representations derived from a visual
histopathology foundation model to identify neighboring areas in different
fragments. Robust pose estimation based on a large number of semantic matching
candidates derives a mosaic of multiple fragments to form the WMS. Experiments
on three different histopathology datasets demonstrate that SemanticStitcher
yields robust WMS mosaicing and consistently outperforms the state of the art
in correct boundary matches.

TL;DR: CoEmoGen提出了一种新的情感图像生成方法，通过多模态大语言模型和心理学启发的分层低秩适应模块，解决了现有方法在语义一致性和可扩展性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在抽象情感生成上表现不佳，且现有EICG方法过度依赖词级属性标签，导致语义不一致和可扩展性差。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型构建高质量情感触发内容描述，并设计分层低秩适应模块（HiLoRA）建模情感特征。

Result: 实验证明CoEmoGen在情感忠实度和语义一致性上优于现有方法，并发布了大规模情感艺术数据集EmoArt。

Conclusion: CoEmoGen为情感图像生成提供了语义一致且可扩展的解决方案，推动了情感驱动艺术创作的发展。

Abstract: Emotional Image Content Generation (EICG) aims to generate semantically clear
and emotionally faithful images based on given emotion categories, with broad
application prospects. While recent text-to-image diffusion models excel at
generating concrete concepts, they struggle with the complexity of abstract
emotions. There have also emerged methods specifically designed for EICG, but
they excessively rely on word-level attribute labels for guidance, which suffer
from semantic incoherence, ambiguity, and limited scalability. To address these
challenges, we propose CoEmoGen, a novel pipeline notable for its semantic
coherence and high scalability. Specifically, leveraging multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), we construct high-quality captions focused on
emotion-triggering content for context-rich semantic guidance. Furthermore,
inspired by psychological insights, we design a Hierarchical Low-Rank
Adaptation (HiLoRA) module to cohesively model both polarity-shared low-level
features and emotion-specific high-level semantics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CoEmoGen's superiority in emotional faithfulness and semantic
coherence from quantitative, qualitative, and user study perspectives. To
intuitively showcase scalability, we curate EmoArt, a large-scale dataset of
emotionally evocative artistic images, providing endless inspiration for
emotion-driven artistic creation. The dataset and code are available at

Conclusion: ARAS和QARAD显著提升了异常合成的真实性和检测性能，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in anomaly synthesis methods, existing
diffusion-based and coarse inpainting pipelines commonly suffer from structural
deficiencies such as micro-structural discontinuities, limited semantic
controllability, and inefficient generation. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce ARAS, a language-conditioned, auto-regressive anomaly synthesis
approach that precisely injects local, text-specified defects into normal
images via token-anchored latent editing. Leveraging a hard-gated
auto-regressive operator and a training-free, context-preserving masked
sampling kernel, ARAS significantly enhances defect realism, preserves
fine-grained material textures, and provides continuous semantic control over
synthesized anomalies. Integrated within our Quality-Aware Re-weighted Anomaly
Detection (QARAD) framework, we further propose a dynamic weighting strategy
that emphasizes high-quality synthetic samples by computing an image-text
similarity score with a dual-encoder model. Extensive experiments across three
benchmark datasets-MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD, demonstrate that our QARAD
outperforms SOTA methods in both image- and pixel-level anomaly detection
tasks, achieving improved accuracy, robustness, and a 5 times synthesis speedup
compared to diffusion-based alternatives. Our complete code and synthesized
dataset will be publicly available.

Motivation: 解决口语数学表达式转换为结构化符号表示的挑战，特别是在教育和研究领域的应用需求。

Method: 基于ASR后校正模型和音频语言模型，结合少样本提示技术，构建了一个包含66,000多个标注样本的数据集。

Result: 在MathSpeech基准测试中CER为28%，在S2L-equations基准测试中显著优于MathSpeech模型（27% vs. 64%）。

Conclusion: 为多模态AI在数学内容识别领域的未来发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Conversion of spoken mathematical expressions is a challenging task that
involves transcribing speech into a strictly structured symbolic representation
while addressing the ambiguity inherent in the pronunciation of equations.
Although significant progress has been achieved in automatic speech recognition
(ASR) and language models (LM), the problem of converting spoken mathematics
into LaTeX remains underexplored. This task directly applies to educational and
research domains, such as lecture transcription or note creation. Based on ASR
post-correction, prior work requires 2 transcriptions, focuses only on isolated
equations, has a limited test set, and provides neither training data nor
multilingual coverage. To address these issues, we present the first fully
open-source large-scale dataset, comprising over 66,000 human-annotated audio
samples of mathematical equations and sentences in both English and Russian,
drawn from diverse scientific domains. In addition to the ASR post-correction
models and few-shot prompting, we apply audio language models, demonstrating
comparable character error rate (CER) results on the MathSpeech benchmark (28%
vs. 30%) for the equations conversion. In contrast, on the proposed
S2L-equations benchmark, our models outperform the MathSpeech model by a
substantial margin of more than 40 percentage points, even after accounting for
LaTeX formatting artifacts (27% vs. 64%). We establish the first benchmark for
mathematical sentence recognition (S2L-sentences) and achieve an equation CER
of 40%. This work lays the groundwork for future advances in multimodal AI,
with a particular focus on mathematical content recognition.

Motivation: 传统野生动物密度估算方法（如捕获-再捕获、距离采样或相机陷阱）劳动密集或空间受限，无人机技术提供了一种高效、非侵入性的替代方案。

Method: 在无叶期使用无人机进行航测，结合热成像和RGB图像，通过手动标注和三种外推方法估算密度，并与相机陷阱的随机遭遇模型（REM）对比。

Result: 无人机方法估算的密度与REM结果相似，但通常更高，反映了白天活动范围更广的特点。

Conclusion: 无人机技术为野生动物密度估算提供了一种有前景且可扩展的方法，与传统方法互补。

Abstract: We use unmanned aerial drones to estimate wildlife density in southeastern
Austria and compare these estimates to camera trap data. Traditional methods
like capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps are well-established
but labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal (IR) and RGB
imagery, drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting. Our surveys
were conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and
November 2024 in three areas of a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape.
Flight transects were based on predefined launch points using a 350 m grid and
an algorithm that defined the direction of systematically randomized transects.
This setup allowed surveying large areas in one day using multiple drones,
minimizing double counts. Flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing
roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) while ensuring detection. Animals were manually
annotated in the recorded imagery and extrapolated to densities per square
kilometer. We applied three extrapolation methods with increasing complexity:
naive area-based extrapolation, bootstrapping, and zero-inflated negative
binomial modelling. For comparison, a Random Encounter Model (REM) estimate was
calculated using camera trap data from the flight period. The drone-based
methods yielded similar results, generally showing higher densities than REM,
except in one area in October. We hypothesize that drone-based density reflects
daytime activity in open and forested areas, while REM estimates average
activity over longer periods within forested zones. Although both approaches
estimate density, they offer different perspectives on wildlife presence. Our
results show that drones offer a promising, scalable method for wildlife
density estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多集中于城市区域且计算量大，难以满足农村地区大规模历史地图分析需求，如验证历史人口普查数据或定位废弃定居点。

Method: 采用分层机器学习方法：先用CNN分类器逐步过滤掉不含建筑的地图区域，再用CNN分割算法提取剩余区域中的建筑特征。

Result: 在爱尔兰历史地图系列上验证，性能高效，成功识别出1839年地图中存在但1899年地图中消失的定居点。

Conclusion: 该方法为历史和考古研究提供了高效工具，尤其适用于农村地区稀疏建筑分布的分析。

Abstract: Historical maps offer a valuable lens through which to study past landscapes
and settlement patterns. While prior research has leveraged machine learning
based techniques to extract building footprints from historical maps, such
approaches have largely focused on urban areas and tend to be computationally
intensive. This presents a challenge for research questions requiring analysis
across extensive rural regions, such as verifying historical census data or
locating abandoned settlements. In this paper, this limitation is addressed by
proposing a scalable and efficient pipeline tailored to rural maps with sparse
building distributions. The method described employs a hierarchical machine
learning based approach: convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers are
first used to progressively filter out map sections unlikely to contain
buildings, significantly reducing the area requiring detailed analysis. The
remaining high probability sections are then processed using CNN segmentation
algorithms to extract building features. The pipeline is validated using test
sections from the Ordnance Survey Ireland historical 25 inch map series and 6
inch map series, demonstrating both high performance and improved efficiency
compared to conventional segmentation-only approaches. Application of the
technique to both map series, covering the same geographic region, highlights
its potential for historical and archaeological discovery. Notably, the
pipeline identified a settlement of approximately 22 buildings in Tully, Co.
Galway, present in the 6 inch map, produced in 1839, but absent from the 25
inch map, produced in 1899, suggesting it may have been abandoned during the
Great Famine period.

Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of adapting the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) for various downstream tasks. However, constructing a more
powerful and generalizable encoder to further enhance performance remains an
open challenge. In this work, we propose SAM2-UNeXT, an advanced framework that
builds upon the core principles of SAM2-UNet while extending the
representational capacity of SAM2 through the integration of an auxiliary
DINOv2 encoder. By incorporating a dual-resolution strategy and a dense glue
layer, our approach enables more accurate segmentation with a simple
architecture, relaxing the need for complex decoder designs. Extensive
experiments conducted on four benchmarks, including dichotomous image
segmentation, camouflaged object detection, marine animal segmentation, and
remote sensing saliency detection, demonstrate the superior performance of our
proposed method. The code is available at

Motivation: 解决雷达数据噪声和多路径效应带来的挑战，实现隐私保护且不受光照影响的人体姿态估计。

Method: 使用变分推断和概率编码器-解码器架构，处理3发射4接收MIMO雷达数据，预测26个三维关节位置及不确定性。

Result: 在光学动捕数据集上，平均关节位置误差为6.425 cm，不确定性校准误差为0.021，数据增强后活动分类F1得分为0.870。

Conclusion: RadProPoser首次实现端到端雷达姿态估计，为可靠且可解释的雷达运动分析奠定基础。

Abstract: Radar-based human pose estimation (HPE) provides a privacy-preserving,
illumination-invariant sensing modality but is challenged by noisy,
multipath-affected measurements. We introduce RadProPoser, a probabilistic
encoder-decoder architecture that processes complex-valued radar tensors from a
compact 3-transmitter, 4-receiver MIMO radar. By incorporating variational
inference into keypoint regression, RadProPoser jointly predicts 26
three-dimensional joint locations alongside heteroscedastic aleatoric
uncertainties and can be recalibrated to predict total uncertainty. We explore
different probabilistic formulations using both Gaussian and Laplace
distributions for latent priors and likelihoods. On our newly released dataset
with optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean
per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree
aspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual
pose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals,
with our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021.
As an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions
enables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification,
resulting in an F1 score of 0.870. To our knowledge, this is the first
end-to-end radar tensor-based HPE system to explicitly model and quantify
per-joint uncertainty from raw radar tensor data, establishing a foundation for
explainable and reliable human motion analysis in radar applications.

Result: 在13个基准测试中显著提升精度和mAP，同时保持计算效率和推理速度。

Conclusion: DyCAF-Net是医学影像、监控和自动驾驶等实际检测任务的鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in object detection rely on modular architectures with
multi-scale fusion and attention mechanisms. However, static fusion heuristics
and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with
occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance. We introduce Dynamic Class-Aware
Fusion Network (DyCAF-Net) that addresses these challenges through three
innovations: (1) an input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck that iteratively
refines multi-scale features via implicit fixed-point modeling, (2) a dual
dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel and spatial
responses using input- and class-dependent cues, and (3) class-aware feature
adaptation that modulates features to prioritize discriminative regions for
rare classes. Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related
architectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines,
DyCAF-Net achieves significant improvements in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95
across 13 diverse benchmarks, including occlusion-heavy and long-tailed
datasets. The framework maintains computational efficiency ($\sim$11.1M
parameters) and competitive inference speeds, while its adaptability to scale
variance, semantic overlaps, and class imbalance positions it as a robust
solution for real-world detection tasks in medical imaging, surveillance, and
autonomous systems.

Motivation: 云层和夜间条件限制了多光谱卫星图像的可用性，而Sentinel-1雷达数据不受这些条件影响。

Method: 采用基于条件潜在流匹配的多阶段训练方法，并首次将余弦调度与流匹配结合。

Result: 生成的图像具有高保真度（FID 0.7432），NDWI和NDVI的结构相似性指数分别为0.6156和0.6874。

Conclusion: CloudBreaker为多光谱数据不可靠或不可用的遥感应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Cloud cover and nighttime conditions remain significant limitations in
satellite-based remote sensing, often restricting the availability and
usability of multi-spectral imagery. In contrast, Sentinel-1 radar images are
unaffected by cloud cover and can provide consistent data regardless of weather
or lighting conditions. To address the challenges of limited satellite imagery,
we propose CloudBreaker, a novel framework that generates high-quality
multi-spectral Sentinel-2 signals from Sentinel-1 data. This includes the
reconstruction of optical (RGB) images as well as critical vegetation and water
indices such as NDVI and NDWI.We employed a novel multi-stage training approach
based on conditional latent flow matching and, to the best of our knowledge,
are the first to integrate cosine scheduling with flow matching. CloudBreaker
demonstrates strong performance, achieving a Frechet Inception Distance (FID)
score of 0.7432, indicating high fidelity and realism in the generated optical
imagery. The model also achieved Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of
0.6156 for NDWI and 0.6874 for NDVI, indicating a high degree of structural
similarity. This establishes CloudBreaker as a promising solution for a wide
range of remote sensing applications where multi-spectral data is typically
unavailable or unreliable

Result: 在e-CK+数据库上达到93.6%的识别率，比现有方法提升25.9%以上。

Conclusion: evTransFER框架通过迁移学习和改进的架构设计，显著提升了事件相机在面部表情识别中的性能。

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that asynchronously
capture per-pixel intensity changes with microsecond latency, high temporal
resolution, and high dynamic range, providing valuable information about the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the scene. In the present work, we propose
evTransFER, a transfer learning-based framework and architecture for face
expression recognition using event-based cameras. The main contribution is a
feature extractor designed to encode the spatio-temporal dynamics of faces,
built by training an adversarial generative method on a different problem
(facial reconstruction) and then transferring the trained encoder weights to
the face expression recognition system. We show that this proposed transfer
learning method greatly improves the ability to recognize facial expressions
compared to training a network from scratch. In addition, we propose an
architecture that incorporates an LSTM to capture longer-term facial expression
dynamics, and we introduce a new event-based representation, referred to as
TIE, both of which further improve the results. We evaluate the proposed
framework on the event-based facial expression database e-CK+ and compare it to
state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed framework
evTransFER achieves a 93.6\% recognition rate on the e-CK+ database,
significantly improving the accuracy (25.9\% points or more) when compared to
state-of-the-art performance for similar problems.

Abstract: We introduce FPG-NAS, a FLOPs-aware Gated Differentiable Neural Architecture
Search framework for efficient 6DoF object pose estimation. Estimating 3D
rotation and translation from a single image has been widely investigated yet
remains computationally demanding, limiting applicability in
resource-constrained scenarios. FPG-NAS addresses this by proposing a
specialized differentiable NAS approach for 6DoF pose estimation, featuring a
task-specific search space and a differentiable gating mechanism that enables
discrete multi-candidate operator selection, thus improving architectural
diversity. Additionally, a FLOPs regularization term ensures a balanced
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The framework explores a vast search
space of approximately 10\textsuperscript{92} possible architectures.
Experiments on the LINEMOD and SPEED+ datasets demonstrate that FPG-NAS-derived
models outperform previous methods under strict FLOPs constraints. To the best
of our knowledge, FPG-NAS is the first differentiable NAS framework
specifically designed for 6DoF object pose estimation.

Conclusion: Uni3R为可泛化的统一3D场景重建和理解提供了新范式。

Abstract: Reconstructing and semantically interpreting 3D scenes from sparse 2D views
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods often
decouple semantic understanding from reconstruction or necessitate costly
per-scene optimization, thereby restricting their scalability and
generalizability. In this paper, we introduce Uni3R, a novel feed-forward
framework that jointly reconstructs a unified 3D scene representation enriched
with open-vocabulary semantics, directly from unposed multi-view images. Our
approach leverages a Cross-View Transformer to robustly integrate information
across arbitrary multi-view inputs, which then regresses a set of 3D Gaussian
primitives endowed with semantic feature fields. This unified representation
facilitates high-fidelity novel view synthesis, open-vocabulary 3D semantic
segmentation, and depth prediction, all within a single, feed-forward pass.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni3R establishes a new state-of-the-art
across multiple benchmarks, including 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on
ScanNet. Our work signifies a novel paradigm towards generalizable, unified 3D

Result: 实验表明LongVie在长范围可控性、一致性和质量上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: LongVie通过创新设计解决了超长视频生成的关键挑战，并提出了LongVGenBench作为评估基准。

Abstract: Controllable ultra-long video generation is a fundamental yet challenging
task. Although existing methods are effective for short clips, they struggle to
scale due to issues such as temporal inconsistency and visual degradation. In
this paper, we initially investigate and identify three key factors: separate
noise initialization, independent control signal normalization, and the
limitations of single-modality guidance. To address these issues, we propose
LongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video
generation. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency:
1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation
across clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces
alignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual
degradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates
both dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals,
complemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively
balances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality. We also
introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 100

TL;DR: Trokens提出了一种将轨迹点转化为语义感知关系令牌的方法，用于改进少样本动作识别，通过语义感知采样和运动建模框架，在多个基准测试中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解需要有效建模运动和外观信息，尤其是少样本动作识别。现有方法在点跟踪方面有进展，但仍面临选择信息点和建模运动模式的挑战。

Method: 提出语义感知采样策略和运动建模框架，结合HoD和轨迹关系建模，将轨迹令牌与语义特征结合。

Result: 在六个少样本动作识别基准测试中取得最优性能。

Conclusion: Trokens通过语义感知和运动建模，显著提升了少样本动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Video understanding requires effective modeling of both motion and appearance
information, particularly for few-shot action recognition. While recent
advances in point tracking have been shown to improve few-shot action
recognition, two fundamental challenges persist: selecting informative points
to track and effectively modeling their motion patterns. We present Trokens, a
novel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational
tokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling
strategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and
semantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that
captures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented
Displacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action
patterns. Our approach effectively combines these trajectory tokens with
semantic features to enhance appearance features with motion information,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across six diverse few-shot action
recognition benchmarks: Something-Something-V2 (both full and small splits),
Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym. For project page see

TL;DR: ICARE是一种基于大语言模型代理的动态多选问答框架，用于评估放射学报告生成的质量，提供透明且可解释的临床评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标缺乏可解释性，无法可靠评估生成的放射学报告。

Method: 利用两个代理（基于真实报告和生成报告）生成临床问题并通过问答评估一致性。

Result: ICARE与专家判断更一致，且对临床内容敏感，能揭示可解释的错误模式。

Conclusion: ICARE为放射学报告生成提供了透明且可解释的评估框架。

Abstract: Radiological imaging is central to diagnosis, treatment planning, and
clinical decision-making. Vision-language foundation models have spurred
interest in automated radiology report generation (RRG), but safe deployment
requires reliable clinical evaluation of generated reports. Existing metrics
often rely on surface-level similarity or behave as black boxes, lacking
interpretability. We introduce ICARE (Interpretable and Clinically-grounded
Agent-based Report Evaluation), an interpretable evaluation framework
leveraging large language model agents and dynamic multiple-choice question
answering (MCQA). Two agents, each with either the ground-truth or generated
report, generate clinically meaningful questions and quiz each other. Agreement
on answers captures preservation and consistency of findings, serving as
interpretable proxies for clinical precision and recall. By linking scores to
question-answer pairs, ICARE enables transparent, and interpretable assessment.
Clinician studies show ICARE aligns significantly more with expert judgment
than prior metrics. Perturbation analyses confirm sensitivity to clinical
content and reproducibility, while model comparisons reveal interpretable error
patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决主观NLP任务中标注者分歧和稀疏标注数据的问题，以更好地捕捉多样化的观点。

Method: 提出DEM-MoE模型，基于标注者人口统计信息路由输入到专家子网络，并探索LLM生成的合成数据用于数据填补。

Result: DEM-MoE在人口统计群体中表现一致，尤其在标注分歧高的数据集上表现突出；合成数据与人类标注有一定一致性。

Conclusion: 结合真实与合成数据的策略取决于数据集结构，这些方法共同提升了多样化观点的表示能力。

Abstract: We present an approach to modeling annotator disagreement in subjective NLP
tasks through both architectural and data-centric innovations. Our model,
DEM-MoE (Demographic-Aware Mixture of Experts), routes inputs to expert
subnetworks based on annotator demographics, enabling it to better represent
structured, group-level variation compared to prior models. DEM-MoE
consistently performs competitively across demographic groups, and shows
especially strong results on datasets with high annotator disagreement. To
address sparse demographic coverage, we test whether LLM-generated synthetic
annotations via zero-shot persona prompting can be used for data imputation. We
show these synthetic judgments align moderately well with human annotations on
our data and offer a scalable way to potentially enrich training data. We then
propose and evaluate approaches for blending real and synthetic data using
strategies tailored to dataset structure. We find that the optimal strategies
depend on dataset structure. Together, these contributions improve the
representation of diverse perspectives.

*Giovanni Cherubin,Andrew Paverd*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Highlight & Summarize (H&S)的设计模式，通过将检索增强生成（RAG）系统分为高亮器和总结器两部分，防止对大型语言模型（LLMs）的越狱和劫持攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 防止LLMs被恶意用户通过特殊提示操控生成不良内容或偏离其设计目的的任务，现有方法易被绕过，因此需要更可靠的设计模式。

Method: H&S将RAG流程分为高亮器（提取相关段落）和总结器（生成连贯答案），避免将用户问题直接暴露给生成模型。

Result: 使用LLM作为高亮器时，H&S生成的回答在正确性、相关性和质量上多数优于标准RAG流程。

Conclusion: H&S通过设计模式有效防止LLMs被攻击，同时提升回答质量。

Abstract: Preventing jailbreaking and model hijacking of Large Language Models (LLMs)
is an important yet challenging task. For example, when interacting with a
chatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM
to generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its
intended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on
hardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to
detect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these
probabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large
space of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and
evaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by
design. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline
(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant
sources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This
is achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which
takes the user's question and extracts relevant passages ("highlights") from
the retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages
and summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible
instantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of
correctness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an
LLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&S responses are judged to be better
than those of a standard RAG pipeline.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了句法操作'Merge'的认知机制，发现三种不同的结构类型可能对应不同的发展或损伤阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨'Merge'作为基本句法操作的认知基础及其在进化中的突然出现。

Method: 通过系统分析参与者对复杂句子的理解，进行聚类分析。

Result: 发现三种不同的结构类型，可能与不同发展阶段或选择性损伤相关。

Conclusion: Merge可能在进化中突然出现，但不同类型的Merge对象由不同认知机制支持。

Abstract: In the modern language sciences, the core computational operation of syntax,
'Merge', is defined as an operation that combines two linguistic units (e.g.,
'brown', 'cat') to form a categorized structure ('brown cat', a Noun Phrase).
This can then be further combined with additional linguistic units based on
this categorial information, respecting non-associativity such that abstract
grouping is respected. Some linguists have embraced the view that Merge is an
elementary, indivisible operation that emerged in a single evolutionary step.
From a neurocognitive standpoint, different mental objects constructed by Merge
may be supported by distinct mechanisms: (1) simple command constructions
(e.g., "eat apples"); (2) the merging of adjectives and nouns ("red boat"); and
(3) the merging of nouns with spatial prepositions ("laptop behind the sofa").
Here, we systematically investigate participants' comprehension of sentences
with increasing levels of syntactic complexity. Clustering analyses revealed
behavioral evidence for three distinct structural types, which we discuss as
potentially emerging at different developmental stages and subject to selective
impairment. While a Merge-based syntax may still have emerged suddenly in
evolutionary time, responsible for the structured symbolic turn our species
took, different cognitive mechanisms seem to underwrite the processing of
various types of Merge-based objects.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了CMRF框架，通过迭代自评估机制提升多模态模型的常识推理能力，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型和视觉语言模型在复杂跨模态推理任务中表现不足，缺乏深度推理能力。

Method: CMRF框架包含三个模块：RDU分解问题、CIE进行推理、CAM评估一致性，结合自适应迭代优化策略。

Result: CMRF在VCR等基准测试中平均准确率达69.4%，优于开源基线2.4个百分点。

Conclusion: CMRF通过模块化设计和迭代优化显著提升了多模态模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements, current large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (LVLMs) continue to struggle with complex, multi-step,
cross-modal common sense reasoning tasks, often exhibiting a lack of
"deliberative thinking." They tend to rely on superficial associations rather
than deep, chained inference, particularly when integrating visual information
with abstract concepts. To address this, we propose the Coherent Multimodal
Reasoning Framework (CMRF), a novel approach that enhances LVLMs' common sense
reasoning capabilities through an iterative, self-evaluating inference
mechanism. CMRF mimics human problem-solving by decomposing complex queries,
generating step-by-step inferences, and self-correcting errors. Our framework
integrates three key modules: a Reasoning Decomposition Unit (RDU) for breaking
down problems into sub-questions, a Contextual Inference Engine (CIE) for
contextual inference, and a Coherence Assessment Module (CAM) for evaluating
logical consistency and confidence. Coupled with an Adaptive Iterative
Refinement strategy, CMRF systematically refines its reasoning paths. Built
upon LLaVA-1.6-34B and trained on a novel Multimodal Daily Activity Reasoning
(MDAR) dataset, CMRF achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source
LVLMs on challenging benchmarks like VCR, A-OKVQA, and DailyLife-MRC. It
attains an average accuracy of 69.4%, surpassing the best open-source baseline
by +2.4 percentage points, with particular strength in complex reasoning
scenarios. Extensive ablation studies and human evaluations confirm the
critical contributions of each module and the effectiveness of iterative
refinement in fostering more coherent and accurate reasoning.

Motivation: 探索感官语言与传统风格特征的关系，提升语言模型的效率和性能。

Method: 使用R4方法和SLIM-LLMs模型，结合低维LIWC特征预测感官语言。

Result: 低维特征（r=24）表现优于全特征（r=74），SLIM-LLMs在五类文本中性能相当但参数减少80%。

Conclusion: 低维风格特征和SLIM-LLMs能高效预测感官语言，为语言模型优化提供新思路。

Abstract: Sensorial language -- the language connected to our senses including vision,
sound, touch, taste, smell, and interoception, plays a fundamental role in how
we communicate experiences and perceptions. We explore the relationship between
sensorial language and traditional stylistic features, like those measured by
LIWC, using a novel Reduced-Rank Ridge Regression (R4) approach. We demonstrate
that low-dimensional latent representations of LIWC features r = 24 effectively
capture stylistic information for sensorial language prediction compared to the
full feature set (r = 74). We introduce Stylometrically Lean Interpretable
Models (SLIM-LLMs), which model non-linear relationships between these style
dimensions. Evaluated across five genres, SLIM-LLMs with low-rank LIWC features
match the performance of full-scale language models while reducing parameters
by up to 80%.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的复杂性和难以理解性使其容易受到攻击，尤其是越狱攻击，因此需要开发强健的检测方法以确保其安全可靠的使用。

Method: 利用上下文共现矩阵和张量的潜在空间特征，提出了一种新颖的检测方法。

Result: 该方法在仅使用0.5%标记提示的情况下，F1分数达到0.83，比基线提高了96.6%，且速度显著提升（2.3至128.4倍）。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据稀缺环境下表现出色，为LLMs的安全使用提供了有效解决方案，并公开了实现以支持未来研究。

Abstract: The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in many applications marks
a significant advance in research and practice. However, their complexity and
hard-to-understand nature make them vulnerable to attacks, especially
jailbreaks designed to produce harmful responses. To counter these threats,
developing strong detection methods is essential for the safe and reliable use
of LLMs. This paper studies this detection problem using the Contextual
Co-occurrence Matrix, a structure recognized for its efficacy in data-scarce
environments. We propose a novel method leveraging the latent space
characteristics of Contextual Co-occurrence Matrices and Tensors for the
effective identification of adversarial and jailbreak prompts. Our evaluations
show that this approach achieves a notable F1 score of 0.83 using only 0.5% of
labeled prompts, which is a 96.6% improvement over baselines. This result
highlights the strength of our learned patterns, especially when labeled data
is scarce. Our method is also significantly faster, speedup ranging from 2.3 to
128.4 times compared to the baseline models. To support future research and
reproducibility, we have made our implementation publicly available.

Conclusion: 论文呼吁在AI与创意领域的讨论中更透明地纳入艺术家视角，并提供了未来研究的方法论基准。

Abstract: As generative AI continues to reshape artistic production and alternate modes
of human expression, artists whose livelihoods are most directly affected have
raised urgent concerns about consent, transparency, and the future of creative
labor. However, the voices of artists are often marginalized in dominant public
and scholarly discourse. This study presents a twelve-year analysis, from 2013
to 2025, of English-language discourse surrounding AI-generated art. It draws
from 439 curated 500-word excerpts sampled from opinion articles, news reports,
blogs, legal filings, and spoken-word transcripts. Through a reproducible
methodology, we identify five stable thematic clusters and uncover a
misalignment between artists' perceptions and prevailing media narratives. Our
findings highlight how the use of technical jargon can function as a subtle
form of gatekeeping, often sidelining the very issues artists deem most urgent.
Our work provides a BERTopic-based methodology and a multimodal baseline for
future research, alongside a clear call for deeper, transparency-driven
engagement with artist perspectives in the evolving AI-creative landscape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG系统中因检索敏感数据而导致的隐私泄露问题。

Method: 提出PAD方法，结合置信度筛选、高效敏感度估计和上下文感知噪声校准，在解码时注入噪声。

Result: 实验表明PAD显著减少隐私泄露，同时保持生成质量，优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: PAD为敏感领域的RAG系统提供了一种通用且可扩展的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the factual accuracy of large
language models (LLMs) by conditioning outputs on external knowledge sources.
However, when retrieval involves private or sensitive data, RAG systems are
susceptible to extraction attacks that can leak confidential information
through generated responses. We propose Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD), a
lightweight, inference-time defense that adaptively injects calibrated Gaussian
noise into token logits during generation. PAD integrates confidence-based
screening to selectively protect high-risk tokens, efficient sensitivity
estimation to minimize unnecessary noise, and context-aware noise calibration
to balance privacy with generation quality. A \renyi Differential Privacy (RDP)
accountant rigorously tracks cumulative privacy loss, enabling explicit
per-response $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees for sensitive outputs.
Unlike prior approaches requiring retraining or corpus-level filtering, PAD is
model-agnostic and operates entirely at decoding time with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate
that PAD substantially reduces private information leakage while preserving
response utility, outperforming existing retrieval- and post-processing-based
defenses. Our work takes an important step toward mitigating privacy risks in
RAG via decoding strategies, paving the way for universal and scalable privacy
solutions in sensitive domains. Our code is available:

Result: 实验表明TPARAG在检索和端到端攻击效果上优于现有方法，揭示了RAG系统的关键漏洞。

Conclusion: TPARAG为RAG系统的安全性提供了新视角，并为其鲁棒性改进提供了参考。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
providing trustworthy responses for knowledge-intensive tasks, they still face
critical limitations such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge. To address
these issues, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework enhances LLMs
with access to external knowledge via a retriever, enabling more accurate and
real-time outputs about the latest events. However, this integration brings new
security vulnerabilities: the risk that malicious content in the external
database can be retrieved and used to manipulate model outputs. Although prior
work has explored attacks on RAG systems, existing approaches either rely
heavily on access to the retriever or fail to jointly consider both retrieval
and generation stages, limiting their effectiveness, particularly in black-box
scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Token-level Precise Attack
on the RAG (TPARAG), a novel framework that targets both white-box and
black-box RAG systems. TPARAG leverages a lightweight white-box LLM as an
attacker to generate and iteratively optimize malicious passages at the token
level, ensuring both retrievability and high attack success in generation.
Extensive experiments on open-domain QA datasets demonstrate that TPARAG
consistently outperforms previous approaches in retrieval-stage and end-to-end
attack effectiveness. These results further reveal critical vulnerabilities in
RAG pipelines and offer new insights into improving their robustness.

Abstract: Comparable texts are topic-aligned documents in multiple languages that are
not direct translations. They are valuable for understanding how a topic is
discussed across languages. This research studies differences in sentiments and
emotions across English-Arabic comparable documents. First, texts are annotated
with sentiment and emotion labels. We apply a cross-lingual method to label
documents with opinion classes (subjective/objective), avoiding reliance on
machine translation. To annotate with emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy,
sadness, surprise), we manually translate the English WordNet-Affect (WNA)
lexicon into Arabic, creating bilingual emotion lexicons used to label the
comparable corpora. We then apply a statistical measure to assess the agreement
of sentiments and emotions in each source-target document pair. This comparison
is especially relevant when the documents originate from different sources. To
our knowledge, this aspect has not been explored in prior literature. Our study
includes English-Arabic document pairs from Euronews, BBC, and Al-Jazeera
(JSC). Results show that sentiment and emotion annotations align when articles
come from the same news agency and diverge when they come from different ones.
The proposed method is language-independent and generalizable to other language
pairs.

Conclusion: 多智能体结构和记忆存储模型有效解决了主题漂移和逻辑问题，提升了故事吸引力。

Abstract: The generation of a long story consisting of several thousand words is a
sub-task in the field of long text generation~(LTG). Previous research has
addressed this challenge through outline-based generation, which employs a
multi-stage method for generating outlines into stories. However, this approach
suffers from two common issues: almost inevitable theme drift caused by the
loss of memory of previous outlines, and tedious plots with incoherent logic
that are less appealing to human readers.
  In this paper, we propose the multi-agent Story Generator structure to
improve the multi-stage method, using large language models~(LLMs) as the core
components of agents. To avoid theme drift, we introduce a memory storage model
comprising two components: a long-term memory storage that identifies the most
important memories, thereby preventing theme drift; and a short-term memory
storage that retains the latest outlines from each generation round. To
incorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle
framework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain
factors and evaluation criteria to generate outline. This framework calculates
the similarity of the former storyline and enhances the appeal of the story by
building a knowledge graph and integrating new node content. Additionally, we
establish a multi-agent interaction stage to simulate writer-reader interaction
through dialogue and revise the story text according to feedback, to ensure it
remains consistent and logical. Evaluations against previous methods
demonstrate that our approach can generate higher-quality long stories.

Result: 在BioMedicine和Finance领域的实验中，RCP-Merging显著提升任务性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RCP-Merging是一种高效且性能优越的模型合并方法，适用于领域特定与长链推理模型的融合。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capability,
termed Reasoning Models, demonstrate superior intricate problem-solving
abilities through multi-step long CoT reasoning. To create a dual-capability
model with long CoT capability and domain-specific knowledge without
substantial computational and data costs, model merging emerges as a highly
resource-efficient method. However, significant challenges lie in merging
domain-specific LLMs with long CoT ones since nowadays merging methods suffer
from reasoning capability degradation, even gibberish output and output
collapse. To overcome this, we introduce RCP-Merging: Merging Long
Chain-of-Thought Models with Domain-Specific Models by Considering Reasoning
Capability as Prior, a novel merging framework designed to integrate
domain-specific LLMs with long CoT capability, meanwhile maintaining model
performance in the original domain. Treating reasoning model weights as
foundational prior, our method utilizes a reasoning capability indicator to
preserve core long CoT capability model weights while selectively merging
essential domain-specific weights. We conducted extensive experiments on
Qwen2.5-7B, Llama3.1-8B, and Qwen2.5-1.5B models in BioMedicine and Finance
domains. Our results show that RCP-Merging successfully merges a reasoning
model with domain-specific ones, improving domain task performance by 9.5% and
9.2% over state-of-the-art methods, without significantly harming the original

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决LLMs在复杂指令下推理懒惰问题的框架，通过预览和自检提升指令遵循能力，实验证明其模型性能优于其他开源和闭源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂指令下的推理能力不足，导致指令遵循效果不一致，主要原因是推理阶段的懒惰行为。

Method: 提出包含预览和自检的严格推理框架，生成复杂约束指令数据集，采用拒绝采样和熵保持微调策略（Entropy-SFT）与熵自适应强化学习（TEA-RL）。

Result: 实验显示模型性能显著提升，Light-IF-32B超越DeepSeek-R1和Doubao-1.6等模型。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了LLMs的推理懒惰问题，提升了复杂指令下的表现，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: While advancements in the reasoning abilities of LLMs have significantly
enhanced their performance in solving mathematical problems, coding tasks, and
general puzzles, their effectiveness in accurately adhering to instructions
remains inconsistent, particularly with more complex directives. Our
investigation identifies lazy reasoning during the thinking stage as the
primary factor contributing to poor instruction adherence. To mitigate this
issue, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to enable rigorous
reasoning processes involving preview and self-checking, essential for
satisfying strict instruction constraints. Specifically, we first generate
instructions with complex constraints and apply a filtering process to obtain
valid prompts, resulting in three distinct prompt datasets categorized as hard,
easy, and pass. Then, we employ rejection sampling on the pass prompts to
curate a small yet high-quality dataset, enabling a cold-start initialization
of the model and facilitating its adaptation to effective reasoning patterns.
Subsequently, we employ an entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning
(Entropy-SFT) strategy coupled with token-wise entropy-adaptive (TEA-RL)
reinforcement learning guided by rule-based dense rewards. This approach
encourages the model to transform its reasoning mechanism, ultimately fostering
generalizable reasoning abilities that encompass preview and self-checking.
Extensive experiments conducted on instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate
remarkable performance improvements across various model scales. Notably, our
Light-IF-32B model surpasses both larger open-source models such as DeepSeek-R1
and closed-source models like Doubao-1.6.

Motivation: 探讨德国议会中政治话语的演变，特别是政党在执政与反对角色转换中的风格变化及其对话题和情感的影响。

Method: 开发并训练了两个机器学习模型（话题分类和情感分类），基于手动标注数据集，评估其在议会演讲中的表现。

Result: 模型表现优异（话题分类AUROC 0.94，情感分类0.89），分析显示政党角色变化显著影响话语风格。

Conclusion: 意识形态和执政责任共同塑造议会话语，研究为理解政党策略和话语动态提供了新视角。

Abstract: This study investigates political discourse in the German parliament, the
Bundestag, by analyzing approximately 28,000 parliamentary speeches from the
last five years. Two machine learning models for topic and sentiment
classification were developed and trained on a manually labeled dataset. The
models showed strong classification performance, achieving an area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94 for topic
classification (average across topics) and 0.89 for sentiment classification.
Both models were applied to assess topic trends and sentiment distributions
across political parties and over time. The analysis reveals remarkable
relationships between parties and their role in parliament. In particular, a
change in style can be observed for parties moving from government to
opposition. While ideological positions matter, governing responsibilities also
shape discourse. The analysis directly addresses key questions about the
evolution of topics, sentiment dynamics, and party-specific discourse
strategies in the Bundestag.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语法性别如何影响跨语言的视觉表现，填补了现有研究对性别与语言结构关系的空白。

Method: 构建跨语言基准数据集，涵盖五种性别语言和两种中性语言，生成28,800张图像，分析语法性别对图像生成的影响。

Result: 语法性别显著影响图像生成，男性语法标记使男性形象占比升至73%，女性语法标记使女性形象占比升至38%，且效果因语言资源丰富度和模型架构而异。

Conclusion: 语言结构本身（而不仅是内容）塑造了AI生成的视觉输出，为多语言多模态系统的偏见与公平性研究提供了新维度。

Abstract: Research on bias in Text-to-Image (T2I) models has primarily focused on
demographic representation and stereotypical attributes, overlooking a
fundamental question: how does grammatical gender influence visual
representation across languages? We introduce a cross-linguistic benchmark
examining words where grammatical gender contradicts stereotypical gender
associations (e.g., ``une sentinelle'' - grammatically feminine in French but
referring to the stereotypically masculine concept ``guard''). Our dataset
spans five gendered languages (French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian) and
two gender-neutral control languages (English, Chinese), comprising 800 unique
prompts that generated 28,800 images across three state-of-the-art T2I models.
Our analysis reveals that grammatical gender dramatically influences image
generation: masculine grammatical markers increase male representation to 73\%
on average (compared to 22\% with gender-neutral English), while feminine
grammatical markers increase female representation to 38\% (compared to 28\% in
English). These effects vary systematically by language resource availability
and model architecture, with high-resource languages showing stronger effects.
Our findings establish that language structure itself, not just content, shapes
AI-generated visual outputs, introducing a new dimension for understanding bias
and fairness in multilingual, multimodal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私是基本人权，但大型语言模型需要大量数据训练，其中可能包含私人信息，因此匿名化敏感信息至关重要。

Method: 研究聚焦于几种预处理方法，用于在领域无关的NLP任务中掩码或伪匿名化私人信息。

Result: 虽然完全匿名化可能不可行，但现有方法可以有效减少隐私泄露风险。

Conclusion: 报告强调了在NLP任务中保护隐私的必要性，并提供了可行的预处理方法。

Abstract: Privacy is a fundamental human right. Data privacy is protected by different
regulations, such as GDPR. However, modern large language models require a huge
amount of data to learn linguistic variations, and the data often contains
private information. Research has shown that it is possible to extract private
information from such language models. Thus, anonymizing such private and
sensitive information is of utmost importance. While complete anonymization may
not be possible, a number of different pre-processing approaches exist for
masking or pseudonymizing private information in textual data. This report
focuses on a few of such approaches for domain-agnostic NLP tasks.

Result: 结构探针受词距影响，对深层句法结构表现不佳，且易受干扰，但不受词预测性影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了结构探针的局限性，并提出了受控基准以改进其评估。

Abstract: The syntactic structures of sentences can be readily read-out from the
activations of large language models (LLMs). However, the ``structural probes''
that have been developed to reveal this phenomenon are typically evaluated on
an indiscriminate set of sentences. Consequently, it remains unclear whether
structural and/or statistical factors systematically affect these syntactic
representations. To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
structural probes on three controlled benchmarks. Our results are three-fold.
First, structural probes are biased by a superficial property: the closer two
words are in a sentence, the more likely structural probes will consider them
as syntactically linked. Second, structural probes are challenged by linguistic
properties: they poorly represent deep syntactic structures, and get interfered
by interacting nouns or ungrammatical verb forms. Third, structural probes do
not appear to be affected by the predictability of individual words. Overall,
this work sheds light on the current challenges faced by structural probes.
Providing a benchmark made of controlled stimuli to better evaluate their

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在心理健康应用中难以复现西方和东方文化中抑郁症状的差异，尤其是在英语提示下。尽管使用东方语言提示有所改善，但模型对文化角色的低敏感性和文化不变的症状层级限制了其表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能复现西方和东方文化中抑郁症状的差异，以评估其在心理健康应用中的文化适应性。

Method: 通过使用西方或东方角色提示LLMs，并比较其在英语和东方语言（中文、日语、印地语）中的表现。

Result: LLMs在英语提示下未能复现文化差异，但在东方语言提示下部分改善。模型对文化角色的低敏感性和文化不变的症状层级是主要原因。

Conclusion: 当前通用LLMs缺乏文化感知能力，限制了其在心理健康应用中的安全性和有效性。

Abstract: Prior clinical psychology research shows that Western individuals with
depression tend to report psychological symptoms, while Eastern individuals
report somatic ones. We test whether Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
increasingly used in mental health, reproduce these cultural patterns by
prompting them with Western or Eastern personas. Results show that LLMs largely
fail to replicate the patterns when prompted in English, though prompting in
major Eastern languages (i.e., Chinese, Japanese, and Hindi) improves alignment
in several configurations. Our analysis pinpoints two key reasons for this
failure: the models' low sensitivity to cultural personas and a strong,
culturally invariant symptom hierarchy that overrides cultural cues. These
findings reveal that while prompt language is important, current
general-purpose LLMs lack the robust, culture-aware capabilities essential for
safe and effective mental health applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政治辩论和政治相关讨论的增加需要新的计算方法来自动分析这些内容，以帮助公民更好地理解政治讨论。然而，政治语言的特殊性和辩论的论证形式（如隐含的沟通策略和论点）使得这一任务极具挑战性。

Method: 作者提出了RooseBERT，一个专门针对政治话语的预训练语言模型，训练于大规模政治辩论和演讲语料库（8K辩论）。模型在四个下游任务上进行了微调和评估。

Result: RooseBERT在命名实体识别、情感分析、论证组件检测与分类、论证关系预测与分类等任务上显著优于通用语言模型。

Conclusion: 领域特定的预训练显著提升了政治辩论分析任务的性能，RooseBERT为研究社区提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: The increasing amount of political debates and politics-related discussions
calls for the definition of novel computational methods to automatically
analyse such content with the final goal of lightening up political
deliberation to citizens. However, the specificity of the political language
and the argumentative form of these debates (employing hidden communication
strategies and leveraging implicit arguments) make this task very challenging,
even for current general-purpose pre-trained Language Models. To address this
issue, we introduce a novel pre-trained Language Model for political discourse
language called RooseBERT. Pre-training a language model on a specialised
domain presents different technical and linguistic challenges, requiring
extensive computational resources and large-scale data. RooseBERT has been
trained on large political debate and speech corpora (8K debates, each composed
of several sub-debates on different topics) in English. To evaluate its
performances, we fine-tuned it on four downstream tasks related to political
debate analysis, i.e., named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, argument
component detection and classification, and argument relation prediction and
classification. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over
general-purpose Language Models on these four tasks, highlighting how
domain-specific pre-training enhances performance in political debate analysis.
We release the RooseBERT language model for the research community.

TL;DR: 提出了一种稳定性-可塑性权衡（SPT）方法，通过表示和权重视角平衡旧知识保留与新知识学习，解决了持续命名实体识别（CNER）中过度稳定性和有限可塑性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNER方法过度依赖知识蒸馏（KD），导致模型过度稳定但可塑性不足，无法有效平衡新旧知识。

Method: 从表示视角引入池化操作增强可塑性；从权重视角动态合并新旧模型权重，并采用权重引导的选择机制；提出基于置信度的伪标签方法处理非实体类型的语义偏移。

Result: 在三个基准数据集的十种CNER设置中，SPT方法显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPT方法有效平衡了稳定性与可塑性，解决了CNER中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is an evolving field that focuses
on sequentially updating an existing model to incorporate new entity types.
Previous CNER methods primarily utilize Knowledge Distillation (KD) to preserve
prior knowledge and overcome catastrophic forgetting, strictly ensuring that
the representations of old and new models remain consistent. Consequently, they
often impart the model with excessive stability (i.e., retention of old
knowledge) but limited plasticity (i.e., acquisition of new knowledge). To
address this issue, we propose a Stability-Plasticity Trade-off (SPT) method
for CNER that balances these aspects from both representation and weight
perspectives. From the representation perspective, we introduce a pooling
operation into the original KD, permitting a level of plasticity by
consolidating representation dimensions. From the weight perspective, we
dynamically merge the weights of old and new models, strengthening old
knowledge while maintaining new knowledge. During this fusion, we implement a
weight-guided selective mechanism to prioritize significant weights. Moreover,
we develop a confidence-based pseudo-labeling approach for the current
non-entity type, which predicts entity types using the old model to handle the
semantic shift of the non-entity type, a challenge specific to CNER that has
largely been ignored by previous methods. Extensive experiments across ten CNER
settings on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPT method surpasses
previous CNER approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving a
suitable stability-plasticity trade-off.

Method: 采用PWYW定价实验，比较三种多模态LLMs，分析其对522名韩国参与者文化消费行为的预测能力。

Result: LLMs在个体层面预测不准确，但能反映群体行为趋势；提示技术改进效果有限。

Conclusion: 研究为计算社会科学中基于人物的模拟提供了实证指导，首次全面评估了LLMs使用真实人类数据的能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated significant
interest in their capacity to simulate human-like behaviors, yet most studies
rely on fictional personas rather than actual human data. We address this
limitation by evaluating LLMs' ability to predict individual economic
decision-making using Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) pricing experiments with real
522 human personas. Our study systematically compares three state-of-the-art
multimodal LLMs using detailed persona information from 522 Korean participants
in cultural consumption scenarios. We investigate whether LLMs can accurately
replicate individual human choices and how persona injection methods affect
prediction performance. Results reveal that while LLMs struggle with precise
individual-level predictions, they demonstrate reasonable group-level
behavioral tendencies. Also, we found that commonly adopted prompting
techniques are not much better than naive prompting methods; reconstruction of
personal narrative nor retrieval augmented generation have no significant gain
against simple prompting method. We believe that these findings can provide the
first comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' capabilities on simulating economic
behavior using real human data, offering empirical guidance for persona-based
simulation in computational social science.

Method: LECTOR结合大型语言模型进行语义分析，并整合个性化学习档案，利用LLM驱动的语义相似性评估优化间隔重复。

Result: 在100天的模拟学习中，LECTOR以90.2%的成功率优于最佳基线算法（88.4%），相对提升2.0%，且在语义相似概念处理上表现突出。

Conclusion: LECTOR为智能辅导系统和自适应学习平台提供了有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Spaced repetition systems are fundamental to efficient learning and memory
retention, but existing algorithms often struggle with semantic interference
and personalized adaptation. We present LECTOR (\textbf{L}LM-\textbf{E}nhanced
\textbf{C}oncept-based \textbf{T}est-\textbf{O}riented \textbf{R}epetition), a
novel adaptive scheduling algorithm specifically designed for test-oriented
learning scenarios, particularly language examinations where success rate is
paramount. LECTOR leverages large language models for semantic analysis while
incorporating personalized learning profiles, addressing the critical challenge
of semantic confusion in vocabulary learning by utilizing LLM-powered semantic
similarity assessment and integrating it with established spaced repetition
principles. Our comprehensive evaluation against six baseline algorithms
(SSP-MMC, SM2, HLR, FSRS, ANKI, THRESHOLD) across 100 simulated learners over
100 days demonstrates significant improvements: LECTOR achieves a 90.2\%
success rate compared to 88.4\% for the best baseline (SSP-MMC), representing a
2.0\% relative improvement. The algorithm shows particular strength in handling
semantically similar concepts, reducing confusion-induced errors while
maintaining computational efficiency. Our results establish LECTOR as a
promising direction for intelligent tutoring systems and adaptive learning
platforms.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在语言使用上与人类的相似性，特别是是否表现出语言趋同这一核心语用特征。

Method: 通过比较模型生成的对话完成与原始人类回答，分析16个语言模型、3个对话语料库和多种风格特征。

Result: 模型强烈趋同于对话风格，但比人类基线更容易过拟合；指令调优和更大模型趋同较少。

Conclusion: 模型与人类的趋同机制可能不同，需进一步研究其底层行为差异。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are generally considered proficient in
generating language, how similar their language usage is to that of humans
remains understudied. In this paper, we test whether models exhibit linguistic
convergence, a core pragmatic element of human language communication, asking:
do models adapt, or converge, to the linguistic patterns of their user? To
answer this, we systematically compare model completions of exisiting dialogues
to the original human responses across sixteen language models, three dialogue
corpora, and a variety of stylometric features. We find that models strongly
converge to the conversation's style, often significantly overfitting relative
to the human baseline. While convergence patterns are often feature-specific,
we observe consistent shifts in convergence across modeling settings, with
instruction-tuned and larger models converging less than their pretrained
counterparts. Given the differences between human and model convergence
patterns, we hypothesize that the underlying mechanisms for these behaviors are
very different.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，其潜在的性别偏见问题日益受到关注。以往研究多关注显性性别线索或短任务，而忽视了生成内容中的隐性偏见。

Method: 研究使用心理学中的性别刻板印象（如攻击性或八卦）构建了开放叙事任务数据集StereoBias-Stories，分析模型对不同属性组合的响应。

Result: 发现模型在无条件提示下偏向男性，但非性别相关属性可缓解偏见；多属性组合会强化刻板印象行为；模型偏见与心理学分类一致且随模型规模增强。

Conclusion: 研究强调了基于心理学评估LLMs的重要性，揭示了隐性偏见的复杂性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used across different
applications, concerns about their potential to amplify gender biases in
various tasks are rising. Prior research has often probed gender bias using
explicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion
and short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit
forms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work,
we investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in
psychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of
narrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories
containing short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or
six) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related
story endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story
changes in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1)
While models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned
prompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes
mitigates this bias. (2) Combining multiple attributes associated with the same
gender stereotype intensifies model behavior, with male ones amplifying bias
and female ones alleviating it. (3) Model biases align with psychological
ground-truth used for categorization, and alignment strength increases with
model size. Together, these insights highlight the importance of
psychology-grounded evaluation of LLMs.

Conclusion: 监督学习结合LLM不确定性可帮助教授更准确评估题目难度，提升考试质量。

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of exam questions is essential for developing good
exams, but professors are not always good at this task. We compare various
Large Language Model-based methods with three professors in their ability to
estimate what percentage of students will give correct answers on True/False
exam questions in the areas of Neural Networks and Machine Learning. Our
results show that the professors have limited ability to distinguish between
easy and difficult questions and that they are outperformed by directly asking
Gemini 2.5 to solve this task. Yet, we obtained even better results using
uncertainties of the LLMs solving the questions in a supervised learning
setting, using only 42 training samples. We conclude that supervised learning
using LLM uncertainty can help professors better estimate the difficulty of
exam questions, improving the quality of assessment.

Conclusion: Hi-Guard为可扩展、透明且可信的内容安全系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: Social platforms have revolutionized information sharing, but also
accelerated the dissemination of harmful and policy-violating content. To
ensure safety and compliance at scale, moderation systems must go beyond
efficiency and offer accuracy and interpretability. However, current approaches
largely rely on noisy, label-driven learning, lacking alignment with moderation
rules and producing opaque decisions that hinder human review. Therefore, we
propose Hierarchical Guard (Hi-Guard), a multimodal moderation framework that
introduces a new policy-aligned decision paradigm. The term "Hierarchical"
reflects two key aspects of our system design: (1) a hierarchical moderation
pipeline, where a lightweight binary model first filters safe content and a
stronger model handles fine-grained risk classification; and (2) a hierarchical
taxonomy in the second stage, where the model performs path-based
classification over a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from coarse to fine-grained
levels. To ensure alignment with evolving moderation policies, Hi-Guard
directly incorporates rule definitions into the model prompt. To further
enhance structured prediction and reasoning, we introduce a multi-level
soft-margin reward and optimize with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
penalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications and improving explanation
quality. Extensive experiments and real-world deployment demonstrate that
Hi-Guard achieves superior classification accuracy, generalization, and
interpretability, paving the way toward scalable, transparent, and trustworthy
content safety systems. Code is available at:

Method: 设计了三种CTTS范式（SA-MR、MA-SR、MA-MR），提出CTTS-MM框架，包括代理协作搜索（ACS）和奖励模型混合（MoR）。

Result: MA-MR范式表现最佳，CTTS-MM在七个主流基准测试中均取得优越性能。

Conclusion: CTTS-MM通过多代理和多奖励模型的协作显著提升了模型性能，为测试时间扩展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising research field for
enhancing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) without extra
training. However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and
Self-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model
(SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling
(STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that
collective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent
systems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first
step towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the
different interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three
primary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent
to multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model
(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.
Based on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively
leverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced
inference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent
Collaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination
of LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model
collaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a
curated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to
select the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking
(PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that
the proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance. Code will be
released at https://github.com/magent4aci/CTTS-MM.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Taggus的管道，用于从葡萄牙语文学作品中提取社交网络，相比现有工具，在角色识别和互动检测任务上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NLP方法（如NER和POS标注）在构建角色社交网络任务上表现不佳，尤其是在小语种（如葡萄牙语）中缺乏标注数据。

Method: Taggus管道结合了POS标注和启发式方法，用于角色识别和互动检测。

Result: Taggus在角色识别和共指消解任务上F1分数达94.1%，互动检测任务上达75.9%，分别比现有工具提高50.7%和22.3%。

Conclusion: Taggus在葡萄牙语文学作品中表现优异，未来可改进角色关系检测，并扩大测试样本范围。管道已公开以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Automatically identifying characters and their interactions from fiction
books is, arguably, a complex task that requires pipelines that leverage
multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, such as Named Entity
Recognition (NER) and Part-of-speech (POS) tagging. However, these methods are
not optimized for the task that leads to the construction of Social Networks of
Characters. Indeed, the currently available methods tend to underperform,
especially in less-represented languages, due to a lack of manually annotated
data for training. Here, we propose a pipeline, which we call Taggus, to
extract social networks from literary fiction works in Portuguese. Our results
show that compared to readily available State-of-the-Art tools -- off-the-shelf
NER tools and Large Language Models (ChatGPT) -- the resulting pipeline, which
uses POS tagging and a combination of heuristics, achieves satisfying results
with an average F1-Score of $94.1\%$ in the task of identifying characters and
solving for co-reference and $75.9\%$ in interaction detection. These
represent, respectively, an increase of $50.7\%$ and $22.3\%$ on results
achieved by the readily available State-of-the-Art tools. Further steps to
improve results are outlined, such as solutions for detecting relationships
between characters. Limitations on the size and scope of our testing samples
are acknowledged. The Taggus pipeline is publicly available to encourage
development in this field for the Portuguese language.2

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为JointThinking的新ICL范式，通过结合Thinking和Nothinking两种推理模式的差异，显著提升了推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注RLLMs的训练和推理策略，而其在上下文学习（ICL）中的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出JointThinking方法，通过并行生成Thinking和Nothinking模式的答案，并在不一致时触发第二轮思考。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中显著优于few-shot CoT和多数投票，且在分布外任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: JointThinking展示了结构思维多样性的价值，并具有强扩展性，为未来ICL研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities through structured and multi-step reasoning. While prior research
has primarily focused on improving their training and inference strategies,
their potential for in-context learning (ICL) remains largely underexplored. To
fill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking),
a new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two
reasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy.
Specifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel:
one in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of
Thinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent,
using a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both
candidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\%
in GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases,
resulting in minimal latency overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms
few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting with improved answer
robustness. Moreover, It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to
training-based SOTA method, while substantially outperforming on
out-of-distribution tasks. We further conduct a systematic analysis of the
calibration mechanism, showing that leveraging different reasoning modes
consistently lowers the error rate and highlights the value of structural
thinking diversity. Additionally, we observe that the performance gap between
actual and ideal reasoning narrows as model size increases in the second round
of thinking, indicating the strong scalability of our approach. Finally, we
discuss current limitations and outline promising directions for future ICL
research in RLLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出ReDSM5，一个基于Reddit帖子的语料库，用于通过DSM-5标准分析抑郁症状，提升模型的临床相关性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统抑郁诊断存在临床访问障碍和社会污名，社交媒体数据（如Reddit）能提供早期抑郁迹象，但现有方法缺乏与DSM-5标准的关联。

Method: 构建ReDSM5语料库，包含1484篇长帖，由心理学家按DSM-5标准逐句标注症状，并提供临床解释。分析语言、句法和情感模式。

Result: ReDSM5结合症状标注和专家解释，为抑郁检测和可解释模型提供基准数据，优于现有资源。

Conclusion: ReDSM5填补了抑郁检测与临床标准间的空白，支持开发更具解释性的模型。

Abstract: Depression is a pervasive mental health condition that affects hundreds of
millions of individuals worldwide, yet many cases remain undiagnosed due to
barriers in traditional clinical access and pervasive stigma. Social media
platforms, and Reddit in particular, offer rich, user-generated narratives that
can reveal early signs of depressive symptomatology. However, existing
computational approaches often label entire posts simply as depressed or not
depressed, without linking language to specific criteria from the DSM-5, the
standard clinical framework for diagnosing depression. This limits both
clinical relevance and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce
ReDSM5, a novel Reddit corpus comprising 1484 long-form posts, each
exhaustively annotated at the sentence level by a licensed psychologist for the
nine DSM-5 depression symptoms. For each label, the annotator also provides a
concise clinical rationale grounded in DSM-5 methodology. We conduct an
exploratory analysis of the collection, examining lexical, syntactic, and
emotional patterns that characterize symptom expression in social media
narratives. Compared to prior resources, ReDSM5 uniquely combines
symptom-specific supervision with expert explanations, facilitating the
development of models that not only detect depression but also generate
human-interpretable reasoning. We establish baseline benchmarks for both
multi-label symptom classification and explanation generation, providing
reference results for future research on detection and interpretability.

Motivation: 虚假信息在社交媒体上的传播带来了负面影响，传统静态学习方法无法适应动态变化的社交环境。

Method: MISDER通过学习每个时期的社会环境表示，并利用时间模型预测未来表示，提出了三种变体（LSTM、ODE和PT）。

Result: 实验结果表明，MISDER在两种流行数据集上优于多种基线方法。

Conclusion: MISDER框架有效解决了虚假信息检测中的动态性问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation across diverse social media platforms has
drawn significant attention from both academic and industrial communities due
to its detrimental effects. Accordingly, automatically distinguishing
misinformation, dubbed as Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an
increasingly active research topic. The mainstream methods formulate MD as a
static learning paradigm, which learns the mapping between the content, links,
and propagation of news articles and the corresponding manual veracity labels.
However, the static assumption is often violated, since in real-world
scenarios, the veracity of news articles may vacillate within the dynamically
evolving social environment. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework, namely Misinformation detection with Dynamic Environmental
Representations (MISDER). The basic idea of MISDER lies in learning a social
environmental representation for each period and employing a temporal model to
predict the representation for future periods. In this work, we specify the
temporal model as the LSTM model, continuous dynamics equation, and pre-trained
dynamics system, suggesting three variants of MISDER, namely MISDER-LSTM,
MISDER-ODE, and MISDER-PT, respectively. To evaluate the performance of MISDER,
we compare it to various MD baselines across 2 prevalent datasets, and the
experimental results can indicate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

Result: 实验表明，引入随机性（尤其是Gumbel-Softmax技巧）能有效缓解软思考的局限性，在八个推理基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: 随机性策略（如Gumbel-Softmax）能释放软思考的潜力，提升LLM在连续概念空间中的推理能力。

Abstract: Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas
existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially
constraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address
this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft,
abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space.
This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by
examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques.
Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous
exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs
predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during
subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different
reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding,
obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens.
To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce
\emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the
Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness
can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential
of Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate
randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across
eight reasoning benchmarks.

Result: 裁剪增强表现更优；域内数据上自监督微调接近监督SOTA，域外数据稍逊。

Conclusion: 自监督微调在域内数据上高效，仅微调最后几层即可达到类似质量。

Abstract: Text embeddings, i.e. vector representations of entire texts, play an
important role in many NLP applications, such as retrieval-augmented
generation, sentiment analysis, clustering, or visualizing collections of texts
for data exploration. Currently, top-performing embedding models are derived
from pre-trained language models via extensive supervised fine-tuning using
curated text pairs. This contrasts with computer vision, where self-supervised
training based on data augmentations has demonstrated remarkable success. Here
we systematically compare the two most well-known augmentation strategies for
positive pair generation in contrastive learning of text embeddings. We assess
embedding quality on MTEB and additional in-domain evaluations and show that
cropping augmentation strongly outperforms the dropout-based approach. We find
that on out-of-domain data, the quality of resulting embeddings is below the
supervised SOTA models, but for in-domain data, self-supervised fine-tuning
produces high-quality text embeddings after very short fine-tuning, sometimes
only marginally below the supervised SOTA. Finally, we show that representation
quality increases towards the last transformer layers, which undergo the
largest change during fine-tuning; and that fine-tuning only those last layers
is sufficient to reach similar embedding quality.

Conclusion: CarbonPDF为解决非结构化PDF报告中的碳足迹问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Product sustainability reports provide valuable insights into the
environmental impacts of a product and are often distributed in PDF format.
These reports often include a combination of tables and text, which complicates
their analysis. The lack of standardization and the variability in reporting
formats further exacerbate the difficulty of extracting and interpreting
relevant information from large volumes of documents. In this paper, we tackle
the challenge of answering questions related to carbon footprints within
sustainability reports available in PDF format. Unlike previous approaches, our
focus is on addressing the difficulties posed by the unstructured and
inconsistent nature of text extracted from PDF parsing. To facilitate this
analysis, we introduce CarbonPDF-QA, an open-source dataset containing
question-answer pairs for 1735 product report documents, along with
human-annotated answers. Our analysis shows that GPT-4o struggles to answer
questions with data inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose
CarbonPDF, an LLM-based technique specifically designed to answer carbon
footprint questions on such datasets. We develop CarbonPDF by fine-tuning Llama
3 with our training data. Our results show that our technique outperforms
current state-of-the-art techniques, including question-answering (QA) systems
finetuned on table and text data.

Conclusion: UPLME在共情检测回归任务中表现优异，尤其在处理噪声标签和不确定性量化方面具有优势。

Abstract: Supervised learning for empathy regression is challenged by noisy
self-reported empathy scores. While many algorithms have been proposed for
learning with noisy labels in textual classification problems, the regression
counterpart is relatively under-explored. We propose UPLME, an
uncertainty-aware probabilistic language modelling framework to capture label
noise in the regression setting of empathy detection. UPLME includes a
probabilistic language model that predicts both empathy score and
heteroscedastic uncertainty and is trained using Bayesian concepts with
variational model ensembling. We further introduce two novel loss components:
one penalises degenerate Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), and another enforces
the similarity between the input pairs on which we predict empathy. UPLME
provides state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Correlation Coefficient:
$0.558\rightarrow0.580$ and $0.629\rightarrow0.634$) in terms of the
performance reported in the literature in two public benchmarks, having label
noise. Through synthetic label noise injection, we show that UPLME is effective
in separating noisy and clean samples based on the predicted uncertainty. UPLME
further outperform (Calibration error: $0.571\rightarrow0.376$) a recent
variational model ensembling-based UQ method designed for regression problems.

Conclusion: FilBench展示了语言特定基准测试的价值，有助于推动菲律宾语言的NLP研究并提升其在LLM开发中的代表性。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLMs on English-based tasks, little is
known about their capabilities in specific languages such as Filipino. In this
work, we address this gap by introducing FilBench, a Filipino-centric benchmark
designed to evaluate LLMs across a diverse set of tasks and capabilities in
Filipino, Tagalog, and Cebuano. We carefully curate the tasks in FilBench to
reflect the priorities and trends of NLP research in the Philippines such as
Cultural Knowledge, Classical NLP, Reading Comprehension, and Generation. By
evaluating 27 state-of-the-art LLMs on FilBench, we find that several LLMs
suffer from reading comprehension and translation capabilities. Our results
indicate that FilBench is challenging, with the best model, GPT-4o, achieving
only a score of 72.23%. Moreover, we also find that models trained specifically
for Southeast Asian languages tend to underperform on FilBench, with the
highest-performing model, SEA-LION v3 70B, achieving only a score of 61.07%.
Our work demonstrates the value of curating language-specific LLM benchmarks to
aid in driving progress on Filipino NLP and increasing the inclusion of
Philippine languages in LLM development.

Motivation: 当前AI部署中，预训练模型的适配方法存在离散优化精度不足和连续参数适配复杂度高的问题。

Result: 在数学推理、情感分析和因果判断任务中，EmbedGrad显著提升性能，如数学问题准确率从14.74%增至58.96%。

Conclusion: EmbedGrad为任务适配提供了新范式，兼具提示工程和参数效率的优势。

Abstract: Effectively adapting powerful pretrained foundation models to diverse tasks
remains a key challenge in AI deployment. Current approaches primarily follow
two paradigms:discrete optimization of text prompts through prompt engineering,
or continuous adaptation via additional trainable parameters. Both exhibit
limitations-discrete methods lack refinement precision while parameter-based
techniques increase complexity and reduce interpretability. To address these
constraints, we propose EmbedGrad, a novel framework that optimizes text prompt
embeddings through gradient-based refinement. Our approach uniquely decouples
training from deployment:during optimization,labeled examples guide precise
embedding adjustments while preserving semantic meaning; during inference, only
optimized embeddings integrate with user queries. This enables fine-grained
calibration impossible in text space, such as enhancing the reasoning
capability of prompts like please reason step by step. Comprehensive
evaluations across mathematical reasoning, sentiment analysis, and causal
judgment tasks demonstrate EmbedGrad's effectiveness:optimizing this reasoning
prompt for Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B increased accuracy from 14.74\% to 58.96\% on
mathematical problems. Consistent improvements were observed across model
scales (0.5B-14B) and all tasks, with particularly significant gains for
smaller models on complex problems like causal judgment. By bridging prompt
engineering and parameter efficiency without architectural changes, our work
establishes embedding refinement as a powerful new paradigm for task
adaptation.

Conclusion: LAGER是一种轻量高效的框架，显著提升了LLM作为评判者的对齐性，适用于多种下游任务。

Abstract: The growing scale of evaluation tasks has led to the widespread adoption of
automated evaluation using large language models, a paradigm known as
"LLMas-a-judge." However, improving its alignment with human preferences
without complex prompts or fine-tuning remains challenging. In this work,
motivated by preliminary findings that middle-to-upper layers encode
semantically and taskrelevant representations that are often more aligned with
human judgments than the final layer, we propose LAGER, a lightweight and
efficient framework for enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge alignment with human scoring,
via internal representations. LAGER produces fine-grained judgment scores by
aggregating cross-layer scoretoken logits and computing the expected score from
a softmax-based distribution, with the LLM backbone kept frozen. LAGER fully
leverages the complementary information across different layers, overcoming the
limitations of relying solely on the final layer. We evaluate our method on the
standard alignment benchmarks Flask, HelpSteer, and BIGGen using Spearman
correlation, and find that LAGER achieves improvements of up to 7.5% over the
best baseline across these benchmarks. Without reasoning steps, LAGER matches
or outperforms reasoning-based methods. Experiments on downstream applications,
such as data selection and emotional understanding, further show the
effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from performance degradation when
faced with domain shifts, primarily due to catastrophic forgetting. In this
work, we propose KILO (Knowledge-Instructed Learning for Continual Adaptation),
a novel continual learning framework that integrates dynamic knowledge graphs
with instruction tuning. By leveraging retrieved domain-specific knowledge as
guidance during training, KILO enhances both adaptability to new domains and
retention of previously acquired knowledge. We pretrain our model on
WikiText-103 and evaluate sequential adaptation across four diverse target
domains: BioASQ, SciQ, TweetEval, and MIND. Our experiments demonstrate that
KILO consistently outperforms strong baselines, including continual
fine-tuning, ERNIE 2.0, and CPT, in terms of backward transfer, forward
transfer, F1 score, retention rate, and training efficiency. These results
highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge retrieval and
instruction prompting to overcome domain shift challenges in continual learning
scenarios.

TL;DR: Double-Bench是一个新的大规模、多语言、多模态评估系统，用于全面评估文档RAG系统的各个组件，填补了现有基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准对文档RAG系统的评估不足，无法反映真实世界的挑战，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 开发了Double-Bench，包含3,276份文档和5,168个查询，覆盖6种语言和4种文档类型，并支持动态更新。

Result: 实验表明文本和视觉嵌入模型的差距在缩小，但现有RAG框架存在过度自信的问题。

Conclusion: Double-Bench为未来文档RAG研究提供了严格的基础，并计划定期更新基准。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show great promise for complex document understanding, yet their
development is critically hampered by inadequate evaluation. Current benchmarks
often focus on specific part of document RAG system and use synthetic data with
incomplete ground truth and evidence labels, therefore failing to reflect
real-world bottlenecks and challenges. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Double-Bench: a new large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal
evaluation system that is able to produce fine-grained assessment to each
component within document RAG systems. It comprises 3,276 documents (72,880
pages) and 5,168 single- and multi-hop queries across 6 languages and 4
document types with streamlined dynamic update support for potential data
contamination issues. Queries are grounded in exhaustively scanned evidence
pages and verified by human experts to ensure maximum quality and completeness.
Our comprehensive experiments across 9 state-of-the-art embedding models, 4
MLLMs and 4 end-to-end document RAG frameworks demonstrate the gap between text
and visual embedding models is narrowing, highlighting the need in building
stronger document retrieval models. Our findings also reveal the
over-confidence dilemma within current document RAG frameworks that tend to
provide answer even without evidence support. We hope our fully open-source
Double-Bench provide a rigorous foundation for future research in advanced
document RAG systems. We plan to retrieve timely corpus and release new
benchmarks on an annual basis.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在多模态讽刺分析（MSA）中的应用，提出了一种无需训练的框架以提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 讽刺是一种复杂的语言现象，传统方法主要依赖文本，而多模态信息的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了一种结合深度对象提取和外部概念知识的训练无关框架。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在多模态讽刺检测和解释任务中有效。

Conclusion: 该框架解决了LVLMs在视觉理解和概念知识方面的不足，提升了多模态讽刺分析能力。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a complex linguistic phenomenon that involves a disparity between
literal and intended meanings, making it challenging for sentiment analysis and
other emotion-sensitive tasks. While traditional sarcasm detection methods
primarily focus on text, recent approaches have incorporated multimodal
information. However, the application of Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs)
in Multimodal Sarcasm Analysis (MSA) remains underexplored. In this paper, we
evaluate LVLMs in MSA tasks, specifically focusing on Multimodal Sarcasm
Detection and Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify key limitations, such as insufficient visual
understanding and a lack of conceptual knowledge. To address these issues, we
propose a training-free framework that integrates in-depth object extraction
and external conceptual knowledge to improve the model's ability to interpret
and explain sarcasm in multimodal contexts. The experimental results on
multiple models show the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The code is
available at https://github.com/cp-cp/LVLM-MSA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户行为序列与语言模型预训练的自然语言结构不匹配，导致语义碎片化，影响预测性能。

Method: 引入行为级注意力汇聚（CTR-Sink），插入汇聚标记并设计两阶段训练策略和注意力汇聚机制。

Result: 在工业数据集和开源数据集（MovieLens、Kuairec）上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CTR-Sink通过优化注意力机制，显著提升了点击率预测的性能。

Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, a core task in recommendation systems,
estimates user click likelihood using historical behavioral data. Modeling user
behavior sequences as text to leverage Language Models (LMs) for this task has
gained traction, owing to LMs' strong semantic understanding and contextual
modeling capabilities. However, a critical structural gap exists: user behavior
sequences consist of discrete actions connected by semantically empty
separators, differing fundamentally from the coherent natural language in LM
pre-training. This mismatch causes semantic fragmentation, where LM attention
scatters across irrelevant tokens instead of focusing on meaningful behavior
boundaries and inter-behavior relationships, degrading prediction performance.
To address this, we propose $\textit{CTR-Sink}$, a novel framework introducing
behavior-level attention sinks tailored for recommendation scenarios. Inspired
by attention sink theory, it constructs attention focus sinks and dynamically
regulates attention aggregation via external information. Specifically, we
insert sink tokens between consecutive behaviors, incorporating
recommendation-specific signals such as temporal distance to serve as stable
attention sinks. To enhance generality, we design a two-stage training strategy
that explicitly guides LM attention toward sink tokens and a attention sink
mechanism that amplifies inter-sink dependencies to better capture behavioral
correlations. Experiments on one industrial dataset and two open-source
datasets (MovieLens, Kuairec), alongside visualization results, validate the
method's effectiveness across scenarios.

Result: FairLangProc提供了一个集中化的实现，促进了偏见缓解技术的广泛应用。

Conclusion: 该工具有助于推动自然语言处理领域的公平性研究和实践。

Abstract: The rise in usage of Large Language Models to near ubiquitousness in recent
years has risen societal concern about their applications in decision-making
contexts, such as organizational justice or healthcare. This, in turn, poses
questions about the fairness of these models in critical settings, which leads
to the developement of different procedures to address bias in Natural Language
Processing. Although many datasets, metrics and algorithms have been proposed
to measure and mitigate harmful prejudice in Natural Language Processing, their
implementation is diverse and far from centralized. As a response, this paper
presents FairLangProc, a comprehensive Python package providing a common
implementation of some of the more recent advances in fairness in Natural
Language Processing providing an interface compatible with the famous Hugging
Face transformers library, aiming to encourage the widespread use and
democratization of bias mitigation techniques. The implementation can be found

TL;DR: 论文研究了LLMs在通用和专用代码生成基准上的表现差异，提出PartialOrderEval方法，通过不同详细程度的提示评估模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在专用基准（如ParEval）表现不佳的原因是缺乏领域知识还是提示细节不足。

Method: 引入PartialOrderEval方法，为代码生成基准提供从最小到最大详细程度的提示序列，并应用于HumanEval和ParEval子集。

Result: 实验显示不同任务对提示详细程度的敏感度不同，明确I/O规范、边缘案例处理和逐步分解是关键改进因素。

Conclusion: 提示细节对LLMs在专用任务上的表现有显著影响，优化提示设计可提升模型性能。

Abstract: State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve high pass@1 on general
benchmarks like HumanEval but underperform on specialized suites such as
ParEval. Is this due to LLMs missing domain knowledge or insufficient prompt
detail is given? To answer this, we introduce PartialOrderEval, which augments
any code generation benchmark with a partial order of prompts from minimal to
maximally detailed. Applying it to HumanEval and both serial and OpenMP subsets
of ParEval, we measure how pass@1 scales with prompt specificity. Our
experiments with Llama-3.x and Qwen2.5-Coder demonstrate varying degrees of
prompt sensitivity across different tasks, and a qualitative analysis
highlights explicit I/O specifications, edge-case handling, and stepwise
breakdowns as the key drivers of prompt detail improvement.

Result: CompassVerifier在多领域任务中表现优异，能处理多种答案类型并识别异常响应。

Conclusion: CompassVerifier和VerifierBench有望推动答案验证、评估协议和强化学习研究。

Abstract: Answer verification is crucial not only for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) by matching their unstructured outputs against standard answers, but
also serves as the reward model to guide LLM optimization. Most evaluation
frameworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer
verification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules
or evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current
methodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically
evaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent
stage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the
robustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across
different domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and
robust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It
demonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse
reasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including
multi-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively
identifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark
comprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented
through manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We
anticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer
verification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research. Code

<details>

Motivation: 由于软性可穿戴辅助设备的非线性和柔顺性，物理建模和嵌入式传感具有挑战性，需要一种新的方法来估计接触力。

Method: 使用SoRoSim工具箱生成多样化的外骨骼几何和驱动场景数据集，开发基于图像和学习的框架，从低分辨率灰度图像中估计接触力。

Conclusion: 该框架可作为外骨骼实时力估计的非侵入性替代方案，适用于闭环控制。

Abstract: Wearable assistive devices are increasingly becoming softer. Modelling their
interface with human tissue is necessary to capture transmission of dynamic
assistance. However, their nonlinear and compliant nature makes both physical
modeling and embedded sensing challenging. In this paper, we develop a
image-based, learning-based framework to estimate distributed contact forces
for a finger-exosuit system. We used the SoRoSim toolbox to generate a diverse
dataset of exosuit geometries and actuation scenarios for training. The method
accurately estimated interaction forces across multiple contact locations from
low-resolution grayscale images, was able to generalize to unseen shapes and
actuation levels, and remained robust under visual noise and contrast
variations. We integrated the model into a feedback controller, and found that
the vision-based estimator functions as a surrogate force sensor for
closed-loop control. This approach could be used as a non-intrusive alternative
for real-time force estimation for exosuits.

Method: 设计并实现HASTA机器人，通过实验和仿真测试不同地面刚度与阻尼组合下的最佳腿部刚度。

Result: 实验表明，可调刚度能显著提高机器人在不同地面条件下的能量效率，支持了研究假设。

Conclusion: 可调刚度是优化垂直跳跃机器人能量效率的有效方法，仿真结果为未来控制器设计提供了参考。

Abstract: We present the design and implementation of HASTA (Hopper with Adjustable
Stiffness for Terrain Adaptation), a vertical hopping robot with real-time
tunable leg stiffness, aimed at optimizing energy efficiency across various
ground profiles (a pair of ground stiffness and damping conditions). By
adjusting leg stiffness, we aim to maximize apex hopping height, a key metric
for energy-efficient vertical hopping. We hypothesize that softer legs perform
better on soft, damped ground by minimizing penetration and energy loss, while
stiffer legs excel on hard, less damped ground by reducing limb deformation and
energy dissipation. Through experimental tests and simulations, we find the
best leg stiffness within our selection for each combination of ground
stiffness and damping, enabling the robot to achieve maximum steady-state
hopping height with a constant energy input. These results support our
hypothesis that tunable stiffness improves energy-efficient locomotion in
controlled experimental conditions. In addition, the simulation provides
insights that could aid in the future development of controllers for selecting
leg stiffness.

Abstract: Animal welfare education could greatly benefit from customized robots to help
children learn about animals and their behavior, and thereby promote positive,
safe child-animal interactions. To this end, we ran Participatory Design
workshops with animal welfare educators and children to identify key
requirements for zoomorphic robots from their perspectives. Our findings
encompass a zoomorphic robot's appearance, behavior, and features, as well as
concepts for a narrative surrounding the robot. Through comparing and
contrasting the two groups, we find the importance of: negative reactions to
undesirable behavior from children; using the facial features and tail to
provide cues signaling an animal's internal state; and a natural, furry
appearance and texture. We also contribute some novel activities for
Participatory Design with children, including branching storyboards inspired by
thematic apperception tests and interactive narratives, and reflect on some of
the key design challenges of achieving consensus between the groups, despite
much overlap in their design concepts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有风险评估方法要么缺乏可解释性，要么未能具体集成到自动驾驶系统中，或仅针对特定场景。

Method: CRI基于物体运动学和空间关系量化方向性风险，采用动态安全包络和RSS原则，结合混合概率-最大融合策略和自适应控制策略。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中，CRI显著降低了碰撞率（19%车辆碰撞/失败路线，20%碰撞/公里），提升了驾驶评分（17%），且运行时开销低（3.6毫秒/决策周期）。

Conclusion: CRI在复杂高风险环境中显著提升了安全性和鲁棒性，同时保持了模块化和低运行时开销。

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving requires precise, real-time risk
assessment and adaptive behavior. Prior work on risk estimation either outputs
coarse, global scene-level metrics lacking interpretability, proposes
indicators without concrete integration into autonomous systems, or focuses
narrowly on specific driving scenarios. We introduce the Context-aware Risk
Index (CRI), a light-weight modular framework that quantifies directional risks
based on object kinematics and spatial relationships, dynamically adjusting
control commands in real time. CRI employs direction-aware spatial partitioning
within a dynamic safety envelope using Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS)
principles, a hybrid probabilistic-max fusion strategy for risk aggregation,
and an adaptive control policy for real-time behavior modulation. We evaluate
CRI on the Bench2Drive benchmark comprising 220 safety-critical scenarios using
a state-of-the-art end-to-end model Transfuser++ on challenging routes. Our
collision-rate metrics show a 19\% reduction (p = 0.003) in vehicle collisions
per failed route, a 20\% reduction (p = 0.004) in collisions per kilometer, a
17\% increase (p = 0.016) in composed driving score, and a statistically
significant reduction in penalty scores (p = 0.013) with very low overhead (3.6
ms per decision cycle). These results demonstrate that CRI substantially
improves safety and robustness in complex, risk-intensive environments while
maintaining modularity and low runtime overhead.

Conclusion: 框架高效适应新用户，同时保持高精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: This letter presents a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) based framework
for simultaneous and accurate estimation of human gait phase and terrain
geometry using a small set of fabric-based wearable soft sensors, with
efficient adaptation to unseen subjects and strong generalization across
different subjects and terrains. Compared to rigid alternatives such as
inertial measurement units, fabric-based soft sensors improve comfort but
introduce nonlinearities due to hysteresis, placement error, and fabric
deformation. Moreover, inter-subject and inter-terrain variability, coupled
with limited calibration data in real-world deployments, further complicate
accurate estimation. To address these challenges, the proposed framework
integrates MAML into a deep learning architecture to learn a generalizable
model initialization that captures subject- and terrain-invariant structure.
This initialization enables efficient adaptation (i.e., adaptation with only a
small amount of calibration data and a few fine-tuning steps) to new users,
while maintaining strong generalization (i.e., high estimation accuracy across
subjects and terrains). Experiments on nine participants walking at various
speeds over five terrain conditions demonstrate that the proposed framework
outperforms baseline approaches in estimating gait phase, locomotion mode, and
incline angle, with superior accuracy, adaptation efficiency, and
generalization.

Abstract: Indoor air quality plays an essential role in the safety and well-being of
occupants, especially in the context of airborne diseases. This paper
introduces AeroSafe, a novel approach aimed at enhancing the efficacy of indoor
air purification systems through a robotic cough emulator testbed and a
digital-twins-based aerosol residence time analysis. Current portable air
filters often overlook the concentrations of respiratory aerosols generated by
coughs, posing a risk, particularly in high-exposure environments like
healthcare facilities and public spaces. To address this gap, we present a
robotic dual-agent physical emulator comprising a maneuverable mannequin
simulating cough events and a portable air purifier autonomously responding to
aerosols. The generated data from this emulator trains a digital twins model,
combining a physics-based compartment model with a machine learning approach,
using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and graph convolution layers.
Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to predict aerosol
concentration dynamics with a mean residence time prediction error within 35
seconds. The proposed system's real-time intervention strategies outperform
static air filter placement, showcasing its potential in mitigating airborne
pathogen risks.

Conclusion: 该机器人平台为解决微塑料污染问题提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Microplastics, defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 millimeters, have
become a pervasive environmental contaminant that accumulates on beaches due to
wind patterns and tidal forcing. Detecting microplastics and mapping their
concentration in the wild remains one of the primary challenges in addressing
this environmental issue. This paper introduces a novel robotic platform that
automatically detects and chemically analyzes microplastics on beach surfaces.
This mobile manipulator system scans areas for microplastics using a camera
mounted on the robotic arm's end effector. The system effectively segments
candidate microplastic particles on sand surfaces even in the presence of
organic matter such as leaves and clams. Once a candidate microplastic particle
is detected, the system steers a near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic sensor onto
the particle using both NIR and visual feedback to chemically analyze it in
real-time. Through experiments in lab and beach environments, the system is
shown to achieve an excellent positional precision in manipulation control and
high microplastic classification accuracy.

Abstract: Contact-rich problems, such as snake robot locomotion, offer unexplored yet
rich opportunities for optimization-based trajectory and acyclic contact
planning. So far, a substantial body of control research has focused on
emulating snake locomotion and replicating its distinctive movement patterns
using shape functions that either ignore the complexity of interactions or
focus on complex interactions with matter (e.g., burrowing movements). However,
models and control frameworks that lie in between these two paradigms and are
based on simple, fundamental rigid body dynamics, which alleviate the
challenging contact and control allocation problems in snake locomotion, remain
absent. This work makes meaningful contributions, substantiated by simulations
and experiments, in the following directions: 1) introducing a reduced-order
model based on Moreau's stepping-forward approach from differential inclusion
mathematics, 2) verifying model accuracy, 3) experimental validation.

Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) including large language models
(LLMs) and hybrid reasoning models present an opportunity to reimagine how
autonomous robots such as drones are designed, developed, and validated. Here,
we demonstrate a fully AI-generated drone control system: with minimal human
input, an artificial intelligence (AI) model authored all the code for a
real-time, self-hosted drone command and control platform, which was deployed
and demonstrated on a real drone in flight as well as a simulated virtual drone
in the cloud. The system enables real-time mapping, flight telemetry,
autonomous mission planning and execution, and safety protocolsall orchestrated
through a web interface hosted directly on the drone itself. Not a single line
of code was written by a human. We quantitatively benchmark system performance,
code complexity, and development speed against prior, human-coded
architectures, finding that AI-generated code can deliver functionally complete
command-and-control stacks at orders-of-magnitude faster development cycles,
though with identifiable current limitations related to specific model context
window and reasoning depth. Our analysis uncovers the practical boundaries of
AI-driven robot control code generation at current model scales, as well as
emergent strengths and failure modes in AI-generated robotics code. This work
sets a precedent for the autonomous creation of robot control systems and, more
broadly, suggests a new paradigm for robotics engineeringone in which future
robots may be largely co-designed, developed, and verified by artificial
intelligence. In this initial work, a robot built a robot's brain.

Abstract: Object manipulation skills are necessary for robots operating in various
daily-life scenarios, ranging from warehouses to hospitals. They allow the
robots to manipulate the given object to their desired arrangement in the
cluttered environment. The existing approaches to solving object manipulations
are either inefficient sampling based techniques, require expert
demonstrations, or learn by trial and error, making them less ideal for
practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel, multimodal
physics-informed neural network (PINN) for solving object manipulation tasks.
Our approach efficiently learns to solve the Eikonal equation without expert
data and finds object manipulation trajectories fast in complex, cluttered
environments. Our method is multimodal as it also reactively replans the
robot's grasps during manipulation to achieve the desired object poses. We
demonstrate our approach in both simulation and real-world scenarios and
compare it against state-of-the-art baseline methods. The results indicate that
our approach is effective across various objects, has efficient training
compared to previous learning-based methods, and demonstrates high performance
in planning time, trajectory length, and success rates. Our demonstration

Abstract: Human-robot object handover is a crucial element for assistive robots that
aim to help people in their daily lives, including elderly care, hospitals, and
factory floors. The existing approaches to solving these tasks rely on
pre-selected target objects and do not contextualize human implicit and
explicit preferences for handover, limiting natural and smooth interaction
between humans and robots. These preferences can be related to the target
object selection from the cluttered environment and to the way the robot should
grasp the selected object to facilitate desirable human grasping during
handovers. Therefore, this paper presents a unified approach that selects
target distant objects using human verbal and non-verbal commands and performs
the handover operation by contextualizing human implicit and explicit
preferences to generate robot grasps and compliant handover motion sequences.
We evaluate our integrated framework and its components through real-world
experiments and user studies with arbitrary daily-life objects. The results of
these evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline in
handling object handover tasks by understanding human preferences. Our

TL;DR: 论文研究了两种估算仿生扑翼机器人Aerobat气动力的方法：基于物理的共轭动量观测器和神经网络回归模型，两者结果一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估算气动力对扑翼机器人的控制、建模和设计至关重要，尤其是实现闭环飞行控制。

Method: 1. 基于哈密顿力学的共轭动量观测器；2. 多层感知机（MLP）神经网络回归模型。

Result: 两种方法在三个力分量（Fx, Fy, Fz）上表现一致。

Conclusion: 共轭动量观测器和神经网络模型均可有效估算气动力，为闭环控制奠定基础。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of aerodynamic forces is essential for advancing the
control, modeling, and design of flapping-wing aerial robots with dynamic
morphing capabilities. In this paper, we investigate two distinct methodologies
for force estimation on Aerobat, a bio-inspired flapping-wing platform designed
to emulate the inertial and aerodynamic behaviors observed in bat flight. Our
goal is to quantify aerodynamic force contributions during tethered flight, a
crucial step toward closed-loop flight control. The first method is a
physics-based observer derived from Hamiltonian mechanics that leverages the
concept of conjugate momentum to infer external aerodynamic forces acting on
the robot. This observer builds on the system's reduced-order dynamic model and
utilizes real-time sensor data to estimate forces without requiring training
data. The second method employs a neural network-based regression model,
specifically a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), to learn a mapping from joint
kinematics, flapping frequency, and environmental parameters to aerodynamic
force outputs. We evaluate both estimators using a 6-axis load cell in a
high-frequency data acquisition setup that enables fine-grained force
measurements during periodic wingbeats. The conjugate momentum observer and the
regression model demonstrate strong agreement across three force components
(Fx, Fy, Fz).

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning（GACL）的框架，用于机器人课程学习，解决了手动设计课程的问题，并在复杂任务中取得了优于现有方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人课程学习依赖手动设计，工程量大且可能不最优；自动化课程学习在简单领域有效，但机器人任务复杂且目标分布部分未知。

Method: GACL框架包含三个创新：任务表示、自适应性能跟踪机制和交替采样的接地方法。

Result: 在轮式导航和四足机器人3D受限空间运动任务中，GACL分别比现有方法提高了6.8%和6.1%的成功率。

Conclusion: GACL为机器人课程学习提供了一种自动化且高效的方法，显著提升了任务性能。

Abstract: Curriculum learning has emerged as a promising approach for training complex
robotics tasks, yet current applications predominantly rely on manually
designed curricula, which demand significant engineering effort and can suffer
from subjective and suboptimal human design choices. While automated curriculum
learning has shown success in simple domains like grid worlds and games where
task distributions can be easily specified, robotics tasks present unique
challenges: they require handling complex task spaces while maintaining
relevance to target domain distributions that are only partially known through
limited samples. To this end, we propose Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning,
a framework specifically designed for robotics curriculum learning with three
key innovations: (1) a task representation that consistently handles complex
robot task design, (2) an active performance tracking mechanism that allows
adaptive curriculum generation appropriate for the robot's current
capabilities, and (3) a grounding approach that maintains target domain
relevance through alternating sampling between reference and synthetic tasks.
We validate GACL on wheeled navigation in constrained environments and
quadruped locomotion in challenging 3D confined spaces, achieving 6.8% and 6.1%
higher success rates, respectively, than state-of-the-art methods in each
domain.

TL;DR: Husky Carbon机器人通过解耦控制架构（Raibert型控制器和MPC结合CRD）解决了轻量化执行器扭矩控制带宽不足的问题，实现了更稳定的推恢复和猫式步态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索姿态操纵与推力矢量化的统一控制，但受限于轻量化执行器的低扭矩控制带宽。

Method: 提出解耦控制架构：Raibert型控制器负责腿部运动，MPC调节推力器，并通过学习接触残余动力学（CRD）处理腿-地面碰撞。

Result: 解耦控制架构结合CRD在推恢复和猫式步态中表现更稳定。

Conclusion: 解耦控制架构结合CRD有效解决了扭矩控制带宽限制，提升了机器人性能。

Abstract: Husky Carbon, a robot developed by Northeastern University, serves as a
research platform to explore unification of posture manipulation and thrust
vectoring. Unlike conventional quadrupeds, its joint actuators and thrusters
enable enhanced control authority, facilitating thruster-assisted narrow-path
walking. While a unified Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework optimizing
both ground reaction forces and thruster forces could theoretically address
this control problem, its feasibility is limited by the low torque-control
bandwidth of the system's lightweight actuators. To overcome this challenge, we
propose a decoupled control architecture: a Raibert-type controller governs
legged locomotion using position-based control, while an MPC regulates the
thrusters augmented by learned Contact Residual Dynamics (CRD) to account for
leg-ground impacts. This separation bypasses the torque-control rate bottleneck
while retaining the thruster MPC to explicitly account for leg-ground impact
dynamics through learned residuals. We validate this approach through both
simulation and hardware experiments, showing that the decoupled control
architecture with CRD performs more stable behavior in terms of push recovery
and cat-like walking gait compared to the decoupled controller without CRD.

Conclusion: LiGen首次将光谱指纹与GAN数据增强结合，为室内定位提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and robust indoor localization is critical for smart building
applications, yet existing Wi-Fi-based systems are often vulnerable to
environmental conditions. This work presents a novel indoor localization
system, called LiGen, that leverages the spectral intensity patterns of ambient
light as fingerprints, offering a more stable and infrastructure-free
alternative to radio signals. To address the limited spectral data, we design a
data augmentation framework based on generative adversarial networks (GANs),
featuring two variants: PointGAN, which generates fingerprints conditioned on
coordinates, and FreeGAN, which uses a weak localization model to label
unconditioned samples. Our positioning model, leveraging a Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) architecture to train on synthesized data, achieves
submeter-level accuracy, outperforming Wi-Fi-based baselines by over 50\%.
LiGen also demonstrates strong robustness in cluttered environments. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first system to combine spectral
fingerprints with GAN-based data augmentation for indoor localization.

Motivation: 解决移动机器人在未知环境中路径规划的两大挑战：自主探索和点目标导航，需实时感知环境和动态更新信息。

Method: 使用条件生成修复模型预测多种布局，结合图注意力机制进行路径规划，融合图表示和占用地图的优势。

Result: 在两个数据集上表现优于现有方法，并在仿真和硬件部署中验证了其高效性和实用性。

Conclusion: CogniPlan通过生成模型与图规划的结合，为未知环境中的路径规划提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Path planning in unknown environments is a crucial yet inherently challenging
capability for mobile robots, which primarily encompasses two coupled tasks:
autonomous exploration and point-goal navigation. In both cases, the robot must
perceive the environment, update its belief, and accurately estimate potential
information gain on-the-fly to guide planning. In this work, we propose
CogniPlan, a novel path planning framework that leverages multiple plausible
layouts predicted by a COnditional GeNerative Inpainting model, mirroring how
humans rely on cognitive maps during navigation. These predictions, based on
the partially observed map and a set of layout conditioning vectors, enable our
planner to reason effectively under uncertainty. We demonstrate strong synergy
between generative image-based layout prediction and graph-attention-based path
planning, allowing CogniPlan to combine the scalability of graph
representations with the fidelity and predictiveness of occupancy maps,
yielding notable performance gains in both exploration and navigation. We
extensively evaluate CogniPlan on two datasets (hundreds of maps and realistic
floor plans), consistently outperforming state-of-the-art planners. We further
deploy it in a high-fidelity simulator and on hardware, showcasing its
high-quality path planning and real-world applicability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种深度学习的鲁棒管模型预测控制器，使750毫克扑翼机器人实现了昆虫般的飞行敏捷性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 昆虫级飞行机器人目前无法实现类似真实昆虫的高机动性，主要受限于低惯性、快速动力学、扑翼空气动力学的不确定性以及对环境干扰的高敏感性。

Method: 设计了深度学习的鲁棒管模型预测控制器，并通过模仿学习方法训练了一个两层的全连接神经网络，以在计算受限的实时系统中实现高反馈率。

Result: 机器人展示了昆虫般的快速转向运动，横向速度和加速度分别达到197厘米/秒和11.7米/秒²，比之前结果提高了447%和255%。此外，机器人还能在160厘米/秒的风干扰和大指令-力映射误差下完成翻转动作。

Conclusion: 该研究在实现昆虫级飞行敏捷性方面取得了里程碑式的进展，并为未来传感和计算自主性的研究提供了启发。

Abstract: Aerial insects exhibit highly agile maneuvers such as sharp braking,
saccades, and body flips under disturbance. In contrast, insect-scale aerial
robots are limited to tracking non-aggressive trajectories with small body
acceleration. This performance gap is contributed by a combination of low robot
inertia, fast dynamics, uncertainty in flapping-wing aerodynamics, and high
susceptibility to environmental disturbance. Executing highly dynamic maneuvers
requires the generation of aggressive flight trajectories that push against the
hardware limit and a high-rate feedback controller that accounts for model and
environmental uncertainty. Here, through designing a deep-learned robust tube
model predictive controller, we showcase insect-like flight agility and
robustness in a 750-millgram flapping-wing robot. Our model predictive
controller can track aggressive flight trajectories under disturbance. To
achieve a high feedback rate in a compute-constrained real-time system, we
design imitation learning methods to train a two-layer, fully connected neural
network, which resembles insect flight control architecture consisting of
central nervous system and motor neurons. Our robot demonstrates insect-like
saccade movements with lateral speed and acceleration of 197 centimeters per
second and 11.7 meters per second square, representing 447$\%$ and 255$\%$
improvement over prior results. The robot can also perform saccade maneuvers
under 160 centimeters per second wind disturbance and large command-to-force
mapping errors. Furthermore, it performs 10 consecutive body flips in 11
seconds - the most challenging maneuver among sub-gram flyers. These results
represent a milestone in achieving insect-scale flight agility and inspire
future investigations on sensing and compute autonomy.

Conclusion: SkeNa任务和SkeNavigator框架为草图导航研究提供了新方向，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: A typical human strategy for giving navigation guidance is to sketch route
maps based on the environmental layout. Inspired by this, we introduce Sketch
map-based visual Navigation (SkeNa), an embodied navigation task in which an
agent must reach a goal in an unseen environment using only a hand-drawn sketch
map as guidance. To support research for SkeNa, we present a large-scale
dataset named SoR, comprising 54k trajectory and sketch map pairs across 71
indoor scenes. In SoR, we introduce two navigation validation sets with varying
levels of abstraction in hand-drawn sketches, categorized based on their
preservation of spatial scales in the environment, to facilitate future
research. To construct SoR, we develop an automated sketch-generation pipeline
that efficiently converts floor plans into hand-drawn representations. To solve
SkeNa, we propose SkeNavigator, a navigation framework that aligns visual
observations with hand-drawn maps to estimate navigation targets. It employs a
Ray-based Map Descriptor (RMD) to enhance sketch map valid feature
representation using equidistant sampling points and boundary distances. To
improve alignment with visual observations, a Dual-Map Aligned Goal Predictor
(DAGP) leverages the correspondence between sketch map features and on-site
constructed exploration map features to predict goal position and guide
navigation. SkeNavigator outperforms prior floor plan navigation methods by a
large margin, improving SPL on the high-abstract validation set by 105%
relatively. Our code and dataset will be released.

Abstract: We propose Hand-Eye Autonomous Delivery (HEAD), a framework that learns
navigation, locomotion, and reaching skills for humanoids, directly from human
motion and vision perception data. We take a modular approach where the
high-level planner commands the target position and orientation of the hands
and eyes of the humanoid, delivered by the low-level policy that controls the
whole-body movements. Specifically, the low-level whole-body controller learns
to track the three points (eyes, left hand, and right hand) from existing
large-scale human motion capture data while high-level policy learns from human
data collected by Aria glasses. Our modular approach decouples the ego-centric
vision perception from physical actions, promoting efficient learning and
scalability to novel scenes. We evaluate our method both in simulation and in
the real-world, demonstrating humanoid's capabilities to navigate and reach in
complex environments designed for humans.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the space of running gaits for the bipedal robot
Cassie. Our first contribution is to present an approach for optimizing gait
efficiency across a spectrum of speeds with the aim of enabling extremely
high-speed running on hardware. This raises the question of how the resulting
gaits compare to human running mechanics, which are known to be highly
efficient in comparison to quadrupeds. Our second contribution is to conduct
this comparison based on established human biomechanical studies. We find that
despite morphological differences between Cassie and humans, key properties of
the gaits are highly similar across a wide range of speeds. Finally, our third
contribution is to integrate the optimized running gaits into a full controller
that satisfies the rules of the real-world task of the 100m dash, including
starting and stopping from a standing position. We demonstrate this controller
on hardware to establish the Guinness World Record for Fastest 100m by a
Bipedal Robot.

Motivation: 通用机器人需在未见环境中执行零样本任务，但现有方法从2D图像和语言数据中获取的语义信息难以精确定位3D动作点。

Method: 提出3D相关性场，绕过高维特征，利用轻量级2D点级指导，并通过多视角聚合解决几何模糊性和语义不确定性。

Conclusion: Point2Act为实际操纵任务提供了高效且精确的3D动作定位解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Point2Act, which directly retrieves the 3D action point relevant
for a contextually described task, leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Foundation models opened the possibility for generalist robots that
can perform a zero-shot task following natural language descriptions within an
unseen environment. While the semantics obtained from large-scale image and
language datasets provide contextual understanding in 2D images, the rich yet
nuanced features deduce blurry 2D regions and struggle to find precise 3D
locations for actions. Our proposed 3D relevancy fields bypass the
high-dimensional features and instead efficiently imbue lightweight 2D
point-level guidance tailored to the task-specific action. The multi-view
aggregation effectively compensates for misalignments due to geometric
ambiguities, such as occlusion, or semantic uncertainties inherent in the
language descriptions. The output region is highly localized, reasoning
fine-grained 3D spatial context that can directly transfer to an explicit
position for physical action at the on-the-fly reconstruction of the scene. Our
full-stack pipeline, which includes capturing, MLLM querying, 3D
reconstruction, and grasp pose extraction, generates spatially grounded
responses in under 20 seconds, facilitating practical manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: MPC-SafeGIL通过设计时安全增强，提高了模仿学习在安全关键场景中的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Imitation Learning has provided a promising approach to learning complex
robot behaviors from expert demonstrations. However, learned policies can make
errors that lead to safety violations, which limits their deployment in
safety-critical applications. We propose MPC-SafeGIL, a design-time approach
that enhances the safety of imitation learning by injecting adversarial
disturbances during expert demonstrations. This exposes the expert to a broader
range of safety-critical scenarios and allows the imitation policy to learn
robust recovery behaviors. Our method uses sampling-based Model Predictive
Control (MPC) to approximate worst-case disturbances, making it scalable to
high-dimensional and black-box dynamical systems. In contrast to prior work
that relies on analytical models or interactive experts, MPC-SafeGIL integrates
safety considerations directly into data collection. We validate our approach
through extensive simulations including quadruped locomotion and visuomotor
navigation and real-world experiments on a quadrotor, demonstrating
improvements in both safety and task performance. See our website here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统导航系统依赖静态地图，难以应对动态风险（如突然开门的人），导致反应式而非预判式避障。

Method: 利用预训练的视觉语言模型（VLM）解析视觉场景，评估潜在动态风险，并预分配风险感知导航成本，结合几何障碍地图实现预判式规划。

Result: 在模拟和多样化动态环境中的实验表明，该方法显著提高了导航成功率并减少了危险遭遇。

Conclusion: 语言成本映射框架为机器人提供了预判动态风险的能力，显著优于传统反应式规划器。

Abstract: Robots operating in human-centric or hazardous environments must proactively
anticipate and mitigate dangers beyond basic obstacle detection. Traditional
navigation systems often depend on static maps, which struggle to account for
dynamic risks, such as a person emerging from a suddenly opening door. As a
result, these systems tend to be reactive rather than anticipatory when
handling dynamic hazards. Recent advancements in pre-trained large language
models and vision-language models (VLMs) create new opportunities for proactive
hazard avoidance. In this work, we propose a zero-shot language-as-cost mapping
framework that leverages VLMs to interpret visual scenes, assess potential
dynamic risks, and assign risk-aware navigation costs preemptively, enabling
robots to anticipate hazards before they materialize. By integrating this
language-based cost map with a geometric obstacle map, the robot not only
identifies existing obstacles but also anticipates and proactively plans around
potential hazards arising from environmental dynamics. Experiments in simulated
and diverse dynamic environments demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly improves navigation success rates and reduces hazard encounters,
compared to reactive baseline planners. Code and supplementary materials are

Conclusion: CookBench为长期规划和复杂任务执行提供了新基准，有助于推动智能体在现实世界中的应用。

Abstract: Embodied Planning is dedicated to the goal of creating agents capable of
executing long-horizon tasks in complex physical worlds. However, existing
embodied planning benchmarks frequently feature short-horizon tasks and
coarse-grained action primitives. To address this challenge, we introduce
CookBench, a benchmark for long-horizon planning in complex cooking scenarios.
By leveraging a high-fidelity simulation environment built upon the powerful
Unity game engine, we define frontier AI challenges in a complex, realistic
environment. The core task in CookBench is designed as a two-stage process.
First, in Intention Recognition, an agent needs to accurately parse a user's
complex intent. Second, in Embodied Interaction, the agent should execute the
identified cooking goal through a long-horizon, fine-grained sequence of
physical actions. Unlike existing embodied planning benchmarks, we refine the
action granularity to a spatial level that considers crucial operational
information while abstracting away low-level robotic control. Besides, We
provide a comprehensive toolset that encapsulates the simulator. Its unified
API supports both macro-level operations, such as placing orders and purchasing
ingredients, and a rich set of fine-grained embodied actions for physical
interaction, enabling researchers to focus on high-level planning and
decision-making. Furthermore, we present an in-depth analysis of
state-of-the-art, closed-source Large Language Model and Vision-Language Model,
revealing their major shortcomings and challenges posed by complex,
long-horizon tasks. The full benchmark will be open-sourced to facilitate
future research.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于力-顺应模型预测控制（FC-MPC）和机器人-用户控制屏障函数（CBFs）的六足导盲机器人系统，实现实时双向交互和安全导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为视觉障碍者在复杂环境中提供实时、安全的导航辅助，需解决双向力交互和动态避障问题。

Method: 采用FC-MPC估计用户施加的力和力矩，通过RLS方法调整机器人运动；使用Robot-User CBFs处理静态和动态障碍；采用Eight-Way Connected DBSCAN聚类障碍物，降低计算复杂度；通过MBEs建模障碍物，并用卡尔曼滤波预测轨迹。

Result: 实验证明系统能适应用户力指令，同时在复杂环境中保证用户和机器人的安全。

Conclusion: 该系统成功整合了力顺应、自主导航和避障功能，适用于复杂环境中的导盲任务。

Abstract: Guiding the visually impaired in complex environments requires real-time
two-way interaction and safety assurance. We propose a Force-Compliance Model
Predictive Control (FC-MPC) and Robot-User Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for
force-compliant navigation and obstacle avoidance in Hexapod guide robots.
FC-MPC enables two-way interaction by estimating user-applied forces and
moments using the robot's dynamic model and the recursive least squares (RLS)
method, and then adjusting the robot's movements accordingly, while Robot-User
CBFs ensure the safety of both the user and the robot by handling static and
dynamic obstacles, and employ weighted slack variables to overcome feasibility
issues in complex dynamic environments. We also adopt an Eight-Way Connected
DBSCAN method for obstacle clustering, reducing computational complexity from
O(n2) to approximately O(n), enabling real-time local perception on
resource-limited on-board robot computers. Obstacles are modeled using Minimum
Bounding Ellipses (MBEs), and their trajectories are predicted through Kalman
filtering. Implemented on the HexGuide robot, the system seamlessly integrates
force compliance, autonomous navigation, and obstacle avoidance. Experimental
results demonstrate the system's ability to adapt to user force commands while
guaranteeing user and robot safety simultaneously during navigation in complex
environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出UniFucGrasp，一种通用的功能性抓取标注策略和数据集，解决了现有数据集忽略功能性抓取的问题，支持低成本高效收集高质量抓取数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有灵巧抓取数据集多关注稳定性，忽略功能性抓取（如开瓶盖、握杯柄），且依赖昂贵难控的高自由度Shadow Hands。

Method: 基于仿生学，将人类自然动作映射到多种手部结构，利用几何力闭合确保功能性、稳定性和类人抓取。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了功能性操作精度和抓取稳定性，支持跨多种机器人手的高效泛化。

Conclusion: UniFucGrasp克服了灵巧抓取中的标注成本和泛化挑战，建立了首个多手功能性抓取数据集。

Abstract: Dexterous grasp datasets are vital for embodied intelligence, but mostly
emphasize grasp stability, ignoring functional grasps needed for tasks like
opening bottle caps or holding cup handles. Most rely on bulky, costly, and
hard-to-control high-DOF Shadow Hands. Inspired by the human hand's
underactuated mechanism, we establish UniFucGrasp, a universal functional grasp
annotation strategy and dataset for multiple dexterous hand types. Based on
biomimicry, it maps natural human motions to diverse hand structures and uses
geometry-based force closure to ensure functional, stable, human-like grasps.
This method supports low-cost, efficient collection of diverse, high-quality
functional grasps. Finally, we establish the first multi-hand functional grasp
dataset and provide a synthesis model to validate its effectiveness.
Experiments on the UFG dataset, IsaacSim, and complex robotic tasks show that
our method improves functional manipulation accuracy and grasp stability,
enables efficient generalization across diverse robotic hands, and overcomes
annotation cost and generalization challenges in dexterous grasping. The

### [207] [Opti-Acoustic Scene Reconstruction in Highly Turbid Underwater Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03408)
*Ivana Collado-Gonzalez,John McConnell,Paul Szenher,Brendan Englot*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时光学-声学场景重建方法，适用于浑浊水域，结合相机和声纳数据提升重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下机器人在浑浊水域中导航时，单目视觉方法不可靠且缺乏深度信息，声纳分辨率低且有高度模糊性，需要一种更优的重建方法。

Method: 通过识别图像中的感兴趣区域并与声纳数据匹配，利用声纳的距离信息和相机的高度数据进行重建。

Result: 实验证明该方法在不同浑浊度水平和实际码头环境中优于其他视觉和声纳方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了浑浊水域中的场景重建问题，代码已开源以促进复现和社区参与。

Abstract: Scene reconstruction is an essential capability for underwater robots
navigating in close proximity to structures. Monocular vision-based
reconstruction methods are unreliable in turbid waters and lack depth scale
information. Sonars are robust to turbid water and non-uniform lighting
conditions, however, they have low resolution and elevation ambiguity. This
work proposes a real-time opti-acoustic scene reconstruction method that is
specially optimized to work in turbid water. Our strategy avoids having to
identify point features in visual data and instead identifies regions of
interest in the data. We then match relevant regions in the image to
corresponding sonar data. A reconstruction is obtained by leveraging range data
from the sonar and elevation data from the camera image. Experimental
comparisons against other vision-based and sonar-based approaches at varying
turbidity levels, and field tests conducted in marina environments, validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We have made our code open-source
to facilitate reproducibility and encourage community engagement.

*Bojan Derajić,Mohamed-Khalil Bouzidi,Sebastian Bernhard,Wolfgang Hönig*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合MPC局部规划器，通过学习近似时变安全集作为MPC终端约束，结合HJ可达性分析实现实时安全规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决HJ可达性分析在实时应用中不可行的问题，同时保证规划的安全性和效率。

Method: 利用HJ值函数可表示为符号距离函数（SDF）与非负残差函数之差，通过神经网络建模残差并优化实时性能。

Result: 在仿真和硬件实验中，相比三种先进方法，成功率提升30%，计算成本相近且路径质量高。

Conclusion: 该方法在实时性和安全性上表现优异，适用于复杂环境中的路径规划。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid MPC local planner that uses a
learning-based approximation of a time-varying safe set, derived from local
observations and applied as the MPC terminal constraint. This set can be
represented as a zero-superlevel set of the value function computed via
Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, which is infeasible in real-time.
We exploit the property that the HJ value function can be expressed as a
difference of the corresponding signed distance function (SDF) and a
non-negative residual function. The residual component is modeled as a neural
network with non-negative output and subtracted from the computed SDF,
resulting in a real-time value function estimate that is at least as safe as
the SDF by design. Additionally, we parametrize the neural residual by a
hypernetwork to improve real-time performance and generalization properties.
The proposed method is compared with three state-of-the-art methods in
simulations and hardware experiments, achieving up to 30\% higher success rates
compared to the best baseline while requiring a similar computational effort
and producing high-quality (low travel-time) solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过戏剧方法为机器人设计表达情感的行为，推动人机交互和共创方法的发展。

Method: 利用叙事目标指导木偶师生成即兴机器人动作，捕捉并整理为可重复使用的动作模板。

Result: 初步试验验证了该方法的可行性，展示了如何精确塑造机器人动作以表达情感，但也揭示了机械限制的挑战。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨学科团队开发社交表达机器人行为提供了模型，同时促进了戏剧作为人机交互训练场的作用。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose theatre-in-the-loop, a framework for developing
expressive robot behaviours tailored to artistic performance through a
director-guided puppeteering workflow. Leveraging theatrical methods, we use
narrative objectives to direct a puppeteer in generating improvised robotic
gestures that convey specific emotions. These improvisations are captured and
curated to build a dataset of reusable movement templates for standalone
playback in future autonomous performances. Initial trials demonstrate the
feasibility of this approach, illustrating how the workflow enables precise
sculpting of robotic gestures into coherent emotional arcs while revealing
challenges posed by the robot's mechanical constraints. We argue that this
practice-led framework provides a model for interdisciplinary teams creating
socially expressive robot behaviours, contributing to (1) theatre as an
interactive training ground for human-robot interaction and (2) co-creation
methodologies between humans and machines.

*Kun Song,Shentao Ma,Gaoming Chen,Ninglong Jin,Guangbao Zhao,Mingyu Ding,Zhenhua Xiong,Jia Pan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CollaBot是一个通用的多机器人协作操作框架，用于处理大型物体移动任务，通过场景分割、协作抓取和两阶段规划实现，实验成功率为52%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人操作任务主要针对小型物体，而工厂或家庭环境中常需移动大型物体，现有研究缺乏可扩展至任意机器人规模和任务类型的通用框架。

Method: 使用SEEM进行场景分割和目标物体点云提取，提出协作抓取框架（局部抓取位姿生成和全局协作），并设计两阶段规划模块生成无碰撞轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，在不同机器人数量、物体和任务下，框架的成功率为52%。

Conclusion: CollaBot框架在多机器人协作操作任务中表现出有效性，为大型物体移动提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: A central research topic in robotics is how to use this system to interact
with the physical world. Traditional manipulation tasks primarily focus on
small objects. However, in factory or home environments, there is often a need
for the movement of large objects, such as moving tables. These tasks typically
require multi-robot systems to work collaboratively. Previous research lacks a
framework that can scale to arbitrary sizes of robots and generalize to various
kinds of tasks. In this work, we propose CollaBot, a generalist framework for
simultaneous collaborative manipulation. First, we use SEEM for scene
segmentation and point cloud extraction of the target object. Then, we propose
a collaborative grasping framework, which decomposes the task into local grasp
pose generation and global collaboration. Finally, we design a 2-stage planning
module that can generate collision-free trajectories to achieve this task.
Experiments show a success rate of 52% across different numbers of robots,
objects, and tasks, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了ADRs在复杂环境中的导航能力，支持更具社会意识的机器人行为。

Abstract: The integration of Automated Delivery Robots (ADRs) into pedestrian-heavy
urban spaces introduces unique challenges in terms of safe, efficient, and
socially acceptable navigation. We develop the complete pipeline for a single
vision sensor based multi-pedestrian detection and tracking, pose estimation,
and monocular depth perception. Leveraging the real-world MOT17 dataset
sequences, this study demonstrates how integrating human-pose estimation and
depth cues enhances pedestrian trajectory prediction and identity maintenance,
even under occlusions and dense crowds. Results show measurable improvements,
including up to a 10% increase in identity preservation (IDF1), a 7%
improvement in multiobject tracking accuracy (MOTA), and consistently high
detection precision exceeding 85%, even in challenging scenarios. Notably, the
system identifies vulnerable pedestrian groups supporting more socially aware
and inclusive robot behaviour.

### [212] [Online Learning for Vibration Suppression in Physical Robot Interaction using Power Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03559)
*Gokhan Solak,Arash Ajoudani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的BMFLC算法（阻尼BMFLC），用于在线学习并抑制协作机器人因外部振动（如电动工具）引起的振动，通过自适应步长和阻尼机制提高了收敛速度和抗噪性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协作机器人在复杂环境（如建筑工地）中工作时，振动抑制能力至关重要。研究旨在主动抑制外部振动源（如电动工具）引起的振动。

Method: 采用BMFLC算法在线学习振动，并通过前馈力控制抵消振动。改进的阻尼BMFLC方法引入自适应步长和基于逻辑函数的阻尼机制，提升收敛速度和抗噪性。

Result: 仿真和物理实验表明，阻尼BMFLC在抑制率和效率上优于原始BMFLC及其递归最小二乘和卡尔曼滤波扩展。

Conclusion: 阻尼BMFLC方法在振动抑制中表现出更高的有效性和效率，适用于实际应用如抛光任务。

Abstract: Vibration suppression is an important capability for collaborative robots
deployed in challenging environments such as construction sites. We study the
active suppression of vibration caused by external sources such as power tools.
We adopt the band-limited multiple Fourier linear combiner (BMFLC) algorithm to
learn the vibration online and counter it by feedforward force control. We
propose the damped BMFLC method, extending BMFLC with a novel adaptive
step-size approach that improves the convergence time and noise resistance. Our
logistic function-based damping mechanism reduces the effect of noise and
enables larger learning rates. We evaluate our method on extensive simulation
experiments with realistic time-varying multi-frequency vibration and
real-world physical interaction experiments. The simulation experiments show
that our method improves the suppression rate in comparison to the original
BMFLC and its recursive least squares and Kalman filter-based extensions.
Furthermore, our method is far more efficient than the latter two. We further
validate the effectiveness of our method in real-world polishing experiments. A
supplementary video is available at https://youtu.be/ms6m-6JyVAI.

Result: 在T型迷宫导航任务中验证了该方法的有效性，能适应光照变化和障碍物。

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人提供了一种动态适应能力，同时保留了核心知识。

Abstract: Imagine a robot controller with the ability to adapt like human synapses,
dynamically rewiring itself to overcome unforeseen challenges in real time.
This paper proposes a novel zero-shot adaptation mechanism for evolutionary
robotics, merging a standard Genetic Algorithm (GA) controller with online
Hebbian plasticity. Inspired by biological systems, the method separates
learning and memory, with the genotype acting as memory and Hebbian updates
handling learning. In our approach, the fitness function is leveraged as a live
scaling factor for Hebbian learning, enabling the robot's neural controller to
adjust synaptic weights on-the-fly without additional training. This adds a
dynamic adaptive layer that activates only during runtime to handle unexpected
environmental changes. After the task, the robot 'forgets' the temporary
adjustments and reverts to the original weights, preserving core knowledge. We
validate this hybrid GA-Hebbian controller on an e-puck robot in a T-maze
navigation task with changing light conditions and obstacles.

TL;DR: DiWA框架通过离线世界模型高效微调扩散策略，显著减少真实世界交互需求，提升机器人技能适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略在强化学习中面临奖励传播困难和高交互成本的问题，需要更高效的微调方法。

Method: 提出DiWA框架，利用离线世界模型微调扩散策略，避免大量环境交互。

Result: 在CALVIN基准测试中，DiWA仅通过离线适应提升八项任务性能，交互需求远低于基线。

Conclusion: DiWA首次实现基于离线世界模型的扩散策略微调，为机器人学习提供更实用、安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning diffusion policies with reinforcement learning (RL) presents
significant challenges. The long denoising sequence for each action prediction
impedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require
millions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical
fine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion
policies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong
dependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for
fine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement
learning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment
interactions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective
adaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline
play interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency,
making the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot
learning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across
eight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude
fewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this
is the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world
robotic skills using an offline world model. We make the code publicly
available at https://diwa.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

TL;DR: Inland-LOAM是一个针对内河水道的LiDAR SLAM框架，通过改进特征提取和水面平面约束减少垂直漂移，并生成结构化2D语义地图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水道图表缺乏实时细节，传统LiDAR SLAM在水道环境中表现不佳，导致垂直漂移和非语义地图，阻碍自主导航。

Method: 提出Inland-LOAM框架，结合改进的特征提取、水面平面约束和体素几何分析，将3D点云转换为结构化2D语义地图。

Result: 在真实数据集上评估显示，Inland-LOAM在定位精度上优于现有方法，生成的语义地图和岸线与实际情况一致。

Conclusion: Inland-LOAM为内河水道自主导航提供了可靠数据，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Accurate geospatial information is crucial for safe, autonomous Inland
Waterway Transport (IWT), as existing charts (IENC) lack real-time detail and
conventional LiDAR SLAM fails in waterway environments. These challenges lead
to vertical drift and non-semantic maps, hindering autonomous navigation.
  This paper introduces Inland-LOAM, a LiDAR SLAM framework for waterways. It
uses an improved feature extraction and a water surface planar constraint to
mitigate vertical drift. A novel pipeline transforms 3D point clouds into
structured 2D semantic maps using voxel-based geometric analysis, enabling
real-time computation of navigational parameters like bridge clearances. An
automated module extracts shorelines and exports them into a lightweight,
IENC-compatible format.
  Evaluations on a real-world dataset show Inland-LOAM achieves superior
localization accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. The generated semantic
maps and shorelines align with real-world conditions, providing reliable data
for enhanced situational awareness. The code and dataset will be publicly
available

Motivation: 随着LLM驱动代理系统的复杂性增加，其高昂成本威胁了可扩展性和可访问性，亟需研究如何在不牺牲性能的情况下降低成本。

Method: 通过实证分析GAIA基准，评估LLM主干选择、代理框架设计和测试时扩展策略的影响，并使用成本-通过指标量化效率-性能权衡。

Result: 提出的Efficient Agents框架保留了96.7%的性能，同时将运营成本从$0.398降至$0.228，成本-通过指标提升28.4%。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents have
enabled sophisticated systems to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, but their
escalating costs threaten scalability and accessibility. This work presents the
first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern
agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without
sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much
complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules
yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the
design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA
benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework
designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we
quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our
findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework
that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains
96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while
reducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4%
improvement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for
designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility
and sustainability of AI-driven solutions.

Result: 证明了方法的正确性和完备性，适用于无域闭包假设的有限规划问题。

Conclusion: 提出了一种解决动态对象规划问题的有效方法，并通过概念验证实现展示了可行性。

Abstract: In classical planning and conformant planning, it is assumed that there are
finitely many named objects given in advance, and only they can participate in
actions and in fluents. This is the Domain Closure Assumption (DCA). However,
there are practical planning problems where the set of objects changes
dynamically as actions are performed; e.g., new objects can be created, old
objects can be destroyed. We formulate the planning problem in first-order
logic, assume an initial theory is a finite consistent set of fluent literals,
discuss when this guarantees that in every situation there are only finitely
many possible actions, impose a finite integer bound on the length of the plan,
and propose to organize search over sequences of actions that are grounded at
planning time. We show the soundness and completeness of our approach. It can
be used to solve the bounded planning problems without DCA that belong to the
intersection of sequential generalized planning (without sensing actions) and
conformant planning, restricted to the case without the disjunction over fluent
literals. We discuss a proof-of-the-concept implementation of our planner.

Result: VSNIT能插入更多样、真实的活动模式，恢复效果显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: VSNIT在活动序列恢复任务中表现出更高的准确性和多样性，为未来基于位置的研究提供了框架。

Abstract: Location-Based Service (LBS) data provides critical insights into human
mobility, yet its sparsity often yields incomplete trip and activity sequences,
making accurate inferences about trips and activities difficult. We raise a
research problem: Can we use activity sequences derived from high-quality LBS
data to recover incomplete activity sequences at the individual level? This
study proposes a new solution, the Variable Selection Network-fused Insertion
Transformer (VSNIT), integrating the Insertion Transformer's flexible sequence
construction with the Variable Selection Network's dynamic covariate handling
capability, to recover missing segments in incomplete activity sequences while
preserving existing data. The findings show that VSNIT inserts more diverse,
realistic activity patterns, more closely matching real-world variability, and
restores disrupted activity transitions more effectively aligning with the
target. It also performs significantly better than the baseline model across
all metrics. These results highlight VSNIT's superior accuracy and diversity in
activity sequence recovery tasks, demonstrating its potential to enhance LBS
data utility for mobility analysis. This approach offers a promising framework
for future location-based research and applications.

natively incorporate opinions on how humans think, and 2) reasoning models that
abstract precise control of the reasoning intuition away from end users. While
powerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery,
they not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also
steerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and
precise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ
optimization (CLIO). CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to
self-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when
self-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief
or answer. Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty
levels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph
structures, and interject corrections. Without any further post-training,
OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with CLIO yields an accuracy of 22.37\% in text-based biology
and medicine questions on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE). This yields a 13.82\% net
or 161.64\% relative increase when compared to the base GPT-4.1 model and
surpasses OpenAI's o3 performance in high and low reasoning effort modes. We
further discovered that oscillations within internal uncertainty measures are
key in determining the accuracy of CLIO's results, revealing how its open
design and internal mechanisms can provide insight and control into scientific
decision-making processes.

*Ziruo Yi,Jinyu Liu,Ting Xiao,Mark V. Albert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种多代理系统（MAS）用于提升放射学视觉问答（RVQA）的准确性和可靠性，解决现有方法在事实准确性、幻觉和跨模态对齐方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减轻放射科医生的工作负担，同时解决现有基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）和检索增强生成（RAG）方法在RVQA中的不足。

Method: 设计多代理系统，包含上下文理解、多模态推理和答案验证的专门代理，并在通过模型分歧过滤筛选的挑战性RVQA数据集上评估。

Result: 实验表明该系统优于现有MLLM基线，案例研究验证了其可靠性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 多代理方法在需要复杂推理的可解释和可信临床AI应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Radiology visual question answering (RVQA) provides precise answers to
questions about chest X-ray images, alleviating radiologists' workload. While
recent methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising progress in RVQA,
they still face challenges in factual accuracy, hallucinations, and cross-modal
misalignment. We introduce a multi-agent system (MAS) designed to support
complex reasoning in RVQA, with specialized agents for context understanding,
multimodal reasoning, and answer validation. We evaluate our system on a
challenging RVQA set curated via model disagreement filtering, comprising
consistently hard cases across multiple MLLMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our system over strong MLLM
baselines, with a case study illustrating its reliability and interpretability.
This work highlights the potential of multi-agent approaches to support
explainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications that require complex
reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Countdown游戏的规划基准，解决了现有基准在衡量长期规划能力上的不足，并通过理论分析和实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有规划基准无法准确衡量基础模型和智能体的长期规划能力，需要一种更合适的评估方法。

Method: 提出基于Countdown游戏的规划基准生成方法，分析其计算复杂性，并与现有基准对比。

Result: 动态生成的基准对现有LLM辅助规划方法极具挑战性，优于其他类似任务。

Conclusion: Countdown游戏基准为评估规划能力提供了更有效的工具，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: There is a broad consensus that the inability to form long-term plans is one
of the key limitations of current foundational models and agents. However, the
existing planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their
planning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined
tasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems
from international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to
formalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and
challenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these
shortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered
around the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target
number from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss
how this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal
benchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows
for an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is
computationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich
enough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive
theoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and
demonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public
benchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on
instances generated using our procedure. Our results show that, unlike other
domains like 24 Game (a special case of Countdown), our proposed dynamic
benchmark remains extremely challenging for existing LLM-based approaches.

Motivation: 日语LLMs由于资源需求大，难以通过后训练方法提升性能和推理能力。

Method: 从推理LLMs中提取推理向量（任务向量的变体），并将其应用于日语LLMs。

Result: 提出了一种简单有效的方法，显著提升了日语LLMs的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源有限的语言LLMs提供了改进思路。

Abstract: Post-training methods have improved the performance and enhanced the
reasoning capability for mainstream large language models (LLMs), but the same
is challenging for Japanese LLMs to achieve due to the amount of resources
required. Inspired by task vectors that extract the change of weights before
and after training, specifically for a certain task, we obtain reasoning
vectors from reasoning LLMs and apply them to Japanese LLMs to boost their
performance. While the resources available present a challenge to improve
Japanese LLMs, we present a simple and effective way to obtain high improvement
and hope to inspire for other languages.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PentestJudge是一个基于大型语言模型的系统，用于评估渗透测试代理的操作，通过分层任务和标准简化评估，并与人类专家对比验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发PentestJudge是为了解决传统方法难以程序化评估渗透测试代理操作的问题，提供一种可扩展且全面的评估方案。

Method: 使用树状结构将渗透测试任务分解为更小的子任务和标准，利用LLM作为评判者，并与人类专家评分对比。

Result: 最佳模型的F1分数达到0.83，工具使用能力强的模型更接近人类专家表现。

Conclusion: PentestJudge展示了LLM在评估渗透测试任务中的潜力，验证比生成更容易，为未来研究提供了方法论支持。

Abstract: We introduce PentestJudge, a system for evaluating the operations of
penetration testing agents. PentestJudge is a large language model
(LLM)-as-judge with access to tools that allow it to consume arbitrary
trajectories of agent states and tool call history to determine whether a
security agent's actions meet certain operating criteria that would be
impractical to evaluate programmatically. We develop rubrics that use a tree
structure to hierarchically collapse the penetration testing task for a
particular environment into smaller, simpler, and more manageable sub-tasks and
criteria until each leaf node represents simple yes-or-no criteria for
PentestJudge to evaluate. Task nodes are broken down into different categories
related to operational objectives, operational security, and tradecraft.
LLM-as-judge scores are compared to human domain experts as a ground-truth
reference, allowing us to compare their relative performance with standard
binary classification metrics, such as F1 scores. We evaluate several frontier
and open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an
F1 score of 0.83. We find models that are better at tool-use perform more
closely to human experts. By stratifying the F1 scores by requirement type, we
find even models with similar overall scores struggle with different types of
questions, suggesting certain models may be better judges of particular
operating criteria. We find that weaker and cheaper models can judge the
trajectories of pentests performed by stronger and more expensive models,
suggesting verification may be easier than generation for the penetration
testing task. We share this methodology to facilitate future research in
understanding the ability of judges to holistically and scalably evaluate the
process quality of AI-based information security agents so that they may be
confidently used in sensitive production environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在简化复杂的环境建模流程，降低地球观测数据、物理工具和决策者之间的门槛。

Method: 利用视觉增强的大型语言模型驱动工作流，自动处理地图和栅格数据，并指导关键决策。

Result: 初步实验显示AQUAH能完成冷启动模拟并生成清晰、透明的报告，结果被专家认可。

Conclusion: 尽管需进一步校准和验证，但AQUAH展示了LLM和视觉技术在环境建模中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce AQUAH, the first end-to-end language-based agent designed
specifically for hydrologic modeling. Starting from a simple natural-language
prompt (e.g., 'simulate floods for the Little Bighorn basin from 2020 to
2022'), AQUAH autonomously retrieves the required terrain, forcing, and gauge
data; configures a hydrologic model; runs the simulation; and generates a
self-contained PDF report. The workflow is driven by vision-enabled large
language models, which interpret maps and rasters on the fly and steer key
decisions such as outlet selection, parameter initialization, and uncertainty
commentary. Initial experiments across a range of U.S. basins show that AQUAH
can complete cold-start simulations and produce analyst-ready documentation
without manual intervention. The results are judged by hydrologists as clear,
transparent, and physically plausible. While further calibration and validation
are still needed for operational deployment, these early outcomes highlight the
promise of LLM-centered, vision-grounded agents to streamline complex
environmental modeling and lower the barrier between Earth observation data,
physics-based tools, and decision makers.

TL;DR: Medblink基准测试评估多模态语言模型在临床感知任务中的表现，发现当前模型表现远低于人类，需改进视觉基础以支持临床应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医生对AI工具的选择性高，模型在简单感知任务中的错误会阻碍其临床采用，因此需要评估模型的感知能力。

Method: 引入Medblink基准测试，包含8个临床任务、1,429个多选题和1,605张图像，评估19种先进多模态语言模型。

Result: 人类标注者准确率为96.4%，而最佳模型仅达65%，显示当前模型在常规感知任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 需加强多模态语言模型的视觉基础能力，以提升其在临床决策支持中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for clinical decision support
and diagnostic reasoning, raising the prospect of end-to-end automated medical
image interpretation. However, clinicians are highly selective in adopting AI
tools; a model that makes errors on seemingly simple perception tasks such as
determining image orientation or identifying whether a CT scan is
contrast-enhance are unlikely to be adopted for clinical tasks. We introduce
Medblink, a benchmark designed to probe these models for such perceptual
abilities. Medblink spans eight clinically meaningful tasks across multiple
imaging modalities and anatomical regions, totaling 1,429 multiple-choice
questions over 1,605 images. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art MLMs, including
general purpose (GPT4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and domain specific (Med Flamingo,
LLaVA Med, RadFM) models. While human annotators achieve 96.4% accuracy, the
best-performing model reaches only 65%. These results show that current MLMs
frequently fail at routine perceptual checks, suggesting the need to strengthen
their visual grounding to support clinical adoption. Data is available on our
project page.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖标记数据训练工作流，无法解决动态问题，需更灵活高效的解决方案。

Method: 结合任务流图和代码表示工作流，采用多网格图优化和自反射进化算法优化工作流。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上平均性能提升8.1%。

Conclusion: Polymath在动态问题中表现优异，无需标记数据，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving complex tasks by executing
agentic workflows composed of detailed instructions and structured operations.
Yet, building general-purpose agents by manually embedding foundation models
into agentic systems such as Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, and ReACT
through text interfaces limits scalability and efficiency. Recently, many
researchers have sought to automate the generation and optimization of these
workflows through code-based representations. However, existing methods often
rely on labeled datasets to train and optimize workflows, making them
ineffective and inflexible for solving real-world, dynamic problems where
labeled data is unavailable. To address this challenge, we introduce Polymath,
a self-optimizing agent with dynamic hierarchical workflow that leverages the
flexibility of task flow graphs and the expressiveness of code-represented
workflows to solve a wide range of real-world, dynamic problems. The proposed
optimization methodology integrates multi-grid-inspired graph optimization with
a self-reflection-guided evolutionary algorithm to refine workflows without
labeled data. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets across coding,
math, and multi-turn QA tasks show that Polymath achieves 8.1% average
improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Method: 结合元认知与仲裁模块的框架，使LLM能自主评估和调节输出，并在七种先进LLM上测试。

Result: 在AdvBench和Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024数据集上，防御成功率显著提升，部分模型在增强模式下接近完美防御。

Conclusion: 该方法为轻量级、高性价比的LLM伦理增强方案，适用于多平台GenAI应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel self-consciousness defense mechanism for Large
Language Models (LLMs) to combat prompt injection attacks. Unlike traditional
approaches that rely on external classifiers, our method leverages the LLM's
inherent reasoning capabilities to perform self-protection. We propose a
framework that incorporates Meta-Cognitive and Arbitration Modules, enabling
LLMs to evaluate and regulate their own outputs autonomously. Our approach is
evaluated on seven state-of-the-art LLMs using two datasets: AdvBench and
Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024. Experiment results demonstrate
significant improvements in defense success rates across models and datasets,
with some achieving perfect and near-perfect defense in Enhanced Mode. We also
analyze the trade-off between defense success rate improvement and
computational overhead. This self-consciousness method offers a lightweight,
cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM ethics, particularly beneficial for
GenAI use cases across various platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工具增强型大语言模型生态碎片化问题，简化开发流程。

Method: 采用协议无关设计，自动化生成模式，双模式并发执行，多源工具管理。

Result: 代码减少60-80%，性能提升3.1倍，兼容现有标准。

Conclusion: 为工具集成架构提供理论见解和实际解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of tool-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) has created
a fragmented ecosystem where developers must navigate multiple protocols,
manual schema definitions, and complex execution workflows. We address this
challenge by proposing a unified approach to tool integration that abstracts
protocol differences while optimizing execution performance. Our solution
demonstrates how protocol-agnostic design principles can significantly reduce
development overhead through automated schema generation, dual-mode concurrent
execution, and seamless multi-source tool management. Experimental results show
60-80% code reduction across integration scenarios, performance improvements up
to 3.1x through optimized concurrency, and full compatibility with existing
function calling standards. This work contributes both theoretical insights
into tool integration architecture and practical solutions for real-world LLM
application development.

Conclusion: 基于代理的评估可以补充（而非替代）人类监督，为下一代LLMs的可信、可扩展评估迈出一步。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in capability and autonomy, evaluating
their outputs-especially in open-ended and complex tasks-has become a critical
bottleneck. A new paradigm is emerging: using AI agents as the evaluators
themselves. This "agent-as-a-judge" approach leverages the reasoning and
perspective-taking abilities of LLMs to assess the quality and safety of other
models, promising calable and nuanced alternatives to human evaluation. In this
review, we define the agent-as-a-judge concept, trace its evolution from
single-model judges to dynamic multi-agent debate frameworks, and critically
examine their strengths and shortcomings. We compare these approaches across
reliability, cost, and human alignment, and survey real-world deployments in
domains such as medicine, law, finance, and education. Finally, we highlight
pressing challenges-including bias, robustness, and meta evaluation-and outline
future research directions. By bringing together these strands, our review
demonstrates how agent-based judging can complement (but not replace) human
oversight, marking a step toward trustworthy, scalable evaluation for
next-generation LLMs.

Result: 在ALFWorld、ScienceWorld和WebShop上实现最优性能，且显著提升令牌效率。

Conclusion: BPO为代理规划中的推理模型提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Reasoning Models have demonstrated remarkable success on
static tasks, yet their application to multi-round agentic planning in
interactive environments faces two fundamental challenges. First, the
intractable credit assignment problem renders conventional reinforcement
learning ineffective in sparse-reward settings. Second, the computational
overhead of verbose, step-by-step reasoning histories is prohibitive. To
address these challenges, we propose BPO, a three-stage framework
(bootstrapping, extrapolation, and refinement) that establishes a
self-improving data flywheel to develop robust reasoning models for
long-horizon, sparse-reward environments. Our framework first bootstraps
efficient reasoning using the proposed planning quaternions with long-short
chain-of-thought fusion. It then extrapolates to out-of-distribution tasks
through complexity-stratified curriculum learning. Finally, the model
iteratively refines itself by learning exclusively on experiences selected via
reward-gated rejection sampling. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and
WebShop demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art with
significant token efficiency, providing a new recipe for reasoning models in
agentic planning.

Conclusion: Collab-Solver通过协作学习优化多模块策略，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了MILP求解的整体性能。

Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has been a fundamental problem in
combinatorial optimization. Previous works have designed a plethora of
hard-coded heuristics to accomplish challenging MILP solving with domain
knowledge. Driven by the high capability of neural networks, recent research is
devoted to replacing manually designed heuristics with learned policies.
Although learning-based MILP methods have shown great promise, existing
worksindependentlytreatthepolicylearningineachmoduleofMILPsolvers without
considering their interdependence, severely hurting the solving speed and
quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-agent-based policy
learning framework for MILP (Collab-Solver), which can collaboratively optimize
the policies for multiple modules. Specifically, we formulate the collaboration
of cut selection and branching in MILP solving as a Stackelberg game. Under
this formulation, we develop a two-phase learning paradigm to stabilize the
collaborative policy learning, where the first phase achieves the
data-communicated policy pretraining and the second phase further orchestrates
the policy learning for various modules. The jointly learned policy
significantly improves the solving performance on both synthetic and
large-scale real-world MILP datasets. Moreover, the policies learned by
Collab-Solver have also demonstrated excellent generalization abilities across
different instance sets.

Conclusion: 研究为ICL机制提供了新见解，展示了其在解决复杂数值问题中的应用潜力。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a new paradigm in large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to perform novel tasks by conditioning on a few
examples embedded in the prompt. Yet, the highly nonlinear behavior of ICL for
NLP tasks remains poorly understood. To shed light on its underlying
mechanisms, this paper investigates whether LLMs can solve ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) under the ICL setting. We formulate standard ODE
problems and their solutions as sequential prompts and evaluate GPT-2 models on
these tasks. Experiments on two types of ODEs show that GPT-2 can effectively
learn a meta-ODE algorithm, with convergence behavior comparable to, or better
than, the Euler method, and achieve exponential accuracy gains with increasing
numbers of demonstrations. Moreover, the model generalizes to
out-of-distribution (OOD) problems, demonstrating robust extrapolation
capabilities. These empirical findings provide new insights into the mechanisms
of ICL in NLP and its potential for solving nonlinear numerical problems.

Motivation: 现有LLMs在复杂医疗诊断中因推理深度不足导致信息丢失或逻辑跳跃，影响诊断准确性。

Result: 在真实医疗数据上的实验表明，ToR框架优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ToR框架显著提升了LLMs在复杂医疗场景中的临床推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in the medical
domain. However, existing models still fall short when faced with complex
medical diagnosis task in the real world. This is mainly because they lack
sufficient reasoning depth, which leads to information loss or logical jumps
when processing a large amount of specialized medical data, leading to
diagnostic errors. To address these challenges, we propose Tree-of-Reasoning
(ToR), a novel multi-agent framework designed to handle complex scenarios.
Specifically, ToR introduces a tree structure that can clearly record the
reasoning path of LLMs and the corresponding clinical evidence. At the same
time, we propose a cross-validation mechanism to ensure the consistency of
multi-agent decision-making, thereby improving the clinical reasoning ability
of multi-agents in complex medical scenarios. Experimental results on
real-world medical data show that our framework can achieve better performance
than existing baseline methods.

Abstract: Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is essential
for their safe and reliable deployment. Existing defenses often rely on shallow
pattern matching, which struggles to generalize to novel and unseen attack
strategies. To address this challenge, we propose the Cognitive-Driven Defense
(CDD) framework, which targets the underlying structure of jailbreak prompts by
applying meta-operations, defined as basic manipulations that conceal harmful
intent.CDD emulates human cognitive reasoning through a structured reasoning
chain. It begins with a global perception of the prompt and follows with a
localized analysis to uncover hidden manipulations. By applying supervised
fine-tuning on this structured chain, the model learns to identify and reason
about known manipulation patterns. To enhance generalization to unseen threats,
an entropy-guided reinforcement learning algorithm (EG-GRPO) is introduced to
encourage exploration of new types and variants of meta-operations. Experiments
demonstrate that CDD can achieve state-of-the-art defense performance and
exhibit strong generalization to unseen jailbreak attacks.

### [237] [ContractEval: Benchmarking LLMs for Clause-Level Legal Risk Identification in Commercial Contracts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03080)
*Shuang Liu,Zelong Li,Ruoyun Ma,Haiyan Zhao,Mengnan Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文评估开源与专有大型语言模型在法律风险分析中的表现，发现专有模型整体更优，开源模型需针对性优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索开源大型语言模型在法律领域的潜力，解决数据保密性问题，填补法律风险分析评估的空白。

Method: 使用ContractEval基准和CUAD数据集，评估4个专有和15个开源模型在商业合同条款风险识别中的表现。

Result: 专有模型表现更优；开源模型在特定维度有竞争力；模型规模增大效果提升减缓；推理模式影响输出效果；量化加速但降低性能。

Conclusion: 开源模型需针对性优化以匹配专有模型；ContractEval为法律领域LLM发展提供基准。

Abstract: The potential of large language models (LLMs) in specialized domains such as
legal risk analysis remains underexplored. In response to growing interest in
locally deploying open-source LLMs for legal tasks while preserving data
confidentiality, this paper introduces ContractEval, the first benchmark to
thoroughly evaluate whether open-source LLMs could match proprietary LLMs in
identifying clause-level legal risks in commercial contracts. Using the
Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), we assess 4 proprietary and 15
open-source LLMs. Our results highlight five key findings: (1) Proprietary
models outperform open-source models in both correctness and output
effectiveness, though some open-source models are competitive in certain
specific dimensions. (2) Larger open-source models generally perform better,
though the improvement slows down as models get bigger. (3) Reasoning
("thinking") mode improves output effectiveness but reduces correctness, likely
due to over-complicating simpler tasks. (4) Open-source models generate "no
related clause" responses more frequently even when relevant clauses are
present. This suggests "laziness" in thinking or low confidence in extracting
relevant content. (5) Model quantization speeds up inference but at the cost of
performance drop, showing the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. These
findings suggest that while most LLMs perform at a level comparable to junior
legal assistants, open-source models require targeted fine-tuning to ensure
correctness and effectiveness in high-stakes legal settings. ContractEval
offers a solid benchmark to guide future development of legal-domain LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型的自动化启发式集合设计方法（AHSD），通过生成互补的启发式集合来提升泛化能力，并提出了EoH-S算法，实验显示其性能显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅设计单一启发式，泛化能力差，无法适应不同问题实例的多样性。

Method: 提出AHSD框架，目标函数为单调超模函数，并设计EoH-S算法，结合互补种群管理和互补感知的模因搜索。

Result: 在三个任务上的实验表明，EoH-S性能提升高达60%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AHSD和EoH-S有效解决了单一启发式的泛化问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
achieved notable success in recent years. Despite the effectiveness of existing
approaches, they only design a single heuristic to serve all problem instances,
often inducing poor generalization across different distributions or settings.
To address this issue, we propose Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD), a new
formulation for LLM-driven AHD. The aim of AHSD is to automatically generate a
small-sized complementary heuristic set to serve diverse problem instances,
such that each problem instance could be optimized by at least one heuristic in
this set. We show that the objective function of AHSD is monotone and
supermodular. Then, we propose Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S) to apply the
AHSD formulation for LLM-driven AHD. With two novel mechanisms of complementary
population management and complementary-aware memetic search, EoH-S could
effectively generate a set of high-quality and complementary heuristics.
Comprehensive experimental results on three AHD tasks with diverse instances
spanning various sizes and distributions demonstrate that EoH-S consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art AHD methods and achieves up to 60\%
performance improvements.

TL;DR: MissDDIM提出了一种基于DDIM的表格数据填补方法，解决了现有DDPM方法的高延迟和输出不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DDPM的数据填补方法存在高推理延迟和输出不稳定的问题，限制了其在实际表格数据中的应用。

Method: MissDDIM采用条件扩散框架，基于DDIM进行表格数据填补。

Result: 该方法减少了推理延迟并稳定了输出，提升了实用性。

Conclusion: MissDDIM为表格数据填补提供了一种更高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for missing data
imputation by modeling the joint distribution of observed and unobserved
variables. However, existing methods, typically based on stochastic denoising
diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), suffer from high inference latency and
variable outputs, limiting their applicability in real-world tabular settings.
To address these deficiencies, we present in this paper MissDDIM, a conditional
diffusion framework that adapts Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for
tabular imputation. While stochastic sampling enables diverse completions, it
also introduces output variability that complicates downstream processing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: T2UE框架通过文本描述生成不可学习示例，避免直接暴露原始图像数据，保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有不可学习示例生成方法依赖原始图像数据，导致隐私泄露的问题。

Method: 利用文本到图像模型将文本描述映射到图像噪声空间，结合误差最小化框架生成有效的不可学习噪声。

Result: T2UE保护的数据显著降低了下游任务的性能，且保护效果适用于多种架构和监督学习场景。

Conclusion: T2UE实现了“零接触数据保护”，仅通过文本描述即可保护数据隐私。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP have revolutionized multimodal
learning, but their reliance on web-scraped datasets, frequently containing
private user data, raises serious concerns about misuse. Unlearnable Examples
(UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model
training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning
of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically
generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their
associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is
often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on
external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox:
users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve
protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction
has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection
solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable
Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using
only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by
employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image
(noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce
effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected
data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal
retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect
generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning
settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of "zero-contact data
protection", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their
textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), the detection of
misinformation has become increasingly important and complex. This research
proposes an innovative verifiable misinformation detection LLM agent that goes
beyond traditional true/false binary judgments. The agent actively verifies
claims through dynamic interaction with diverse web sources, assesses
information source credibility, synthesizes evidence, and provides a complete
verifiable reasoning process. Our designed agent architecture includes three
core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and
numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute
multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form
comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation
datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning
models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics,
quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against
rewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms
baseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency,
and resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for
trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能教育中生成代理模型的开发仍不成熟，主要挑战在于教育场景的复杂性（如学习者的多样认知行为和个性化教学需求）。

Method: 提出AgentSME框架，包含三种通信模式（Solo、Mono、Echo），并采用准确性为主要指标，辅以多样性评估。测试了六种LLM模型。

Result: Echo通信模式的生成代理准确性最高，DeepSeek模型在多样性上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为提升代理学习能力和智能教育模型提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: Generative agent models specifically tailored for smart education are
critical, yet remain relatively underdeveloped. A key challenge stems from the
inherent complexity of educational contexts: learners are human beings with
various cognitive behaviors, and pedagogy is fundamentally centered on
personalized human-to-human communication. To address this issue, this paper
proposes AgentSME, a unified generative agent framework powered by LLM. Three
directional communication modes are considered in the models, namely Solo,
Mono, and Echo, reflecting different types of agency autonomy and communicative
reciprocity. Accuracy is adopted as the primary evaluation metric, complemented
by three diversity indices designed to assess the diversity of reasoning
contents. Six widely used LLMs are tested to validate the robustness of
communication modes across different model tiers, which are equally divided
into base-capacity and high-capacity configurations. The results show that
generative agents that employ the Echo communication mode achieve the highest
accuracy scores, while DeepSeek exhibits the greatest diversity. This study
provides valuable information to improve agent learning capabilities and
inspire smart education models.

Conclusion: 该方法为构建可靠优化LLM代理提供了可扩展、可验证且系统化的路径。

Abstract: We present a framework for training trustworthy large language model (LLM)
agents for optimization modeling via a verifiable synthetic data generation
pipeline. Focusing on linear and mixed-integer linear programming, our approach
begins with structured symbolic representations and systematically produces
natural language descriptions, mathematical formulations, and solver-executable
code. By programmatically constructing each instance with known optimal
solutions, the pipeline ensures full verifiability and enables automatic
filtering of low-quality demonstrations generated by teacher models. Each
dataset instance includes a structured representation of the optimization
problem, a corresponding natural language description, the verified optimal
solution, and step-by-step demonstrations - generated by a teacher model - that
show how to model and solve the problem across multiple optimization modeling
languages. This enables supervised fine-tuning of open-source LLMs specifically
tailored to optimization tasks. To operationalize this pipeline, we introduce
OptiTrust, a modular LLM agent that performs multi-stage translation from
natural language to solver-ready code, leveraging stepwise demonstrations,
multi-language inference, and majority-vote cross-validation. Our agent
achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Out of 7
datasets, it achieves the highest accuracy on six and outperforms the next-best
algorithm by at least 8 percentage on three of them. Our approach provides a
scalable, verifiable, and principled path toward building reliable LLM agents
for real-world optimization applications.

Abstract: This research investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

students. By focusing on prominent large language models (LLMs) such as
GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude Sonnet, and Llama 2, the study assesses
their effectiveness in conveying environmental concepts and, consequently,
facilitating environmental education. The investigation employs a standardized
tool, the Environmental Knowledge Test (EKT-19), supplemented by targeted
questions, to evaluate the environmental knowledge of university students in
comparison to the responses generated by the AI models. The results of this
study suggest that while AI models possess a vast, readily accessible, and

Abstract: We present the $Y_0$ Python package, which implements causal identification
algorithms that apply interventional, counterfactual, and transportability
queries to data from (randomized) controlled trials, observational studies, or
mixtures thereof. $Y_0$ focuses on the qualitative investigation of causation,
helping researchers determine whether a causal relationship can be estimated
from available data before attempting to estimate how strong that relationship
is. Furthermore, $Y_0$ provides guidance on how to transform the causal query
into a symbolic estimand that can be non-parametrically estimated from the
available data. $Y_0$ provides a domain-specific language for representing
causal queries and estimands as symbolic probabilistic expressions, tools for
representing causal graphical models with unobserved confounders, such as
acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs), and implementations of numerous

Abstract: Mathematical geometric reasoning is essential for scientific discovery and
educational development, requiring precise logic and rigorous formal
verification. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have improved reasoning tasks, existing models typically struggle with formal
geometric reasoning, particularly when dynamically constructing and verifying
auxiliary geometric elements. To address these challenges, we introduce
Geoint-R1, a multimodal reasoning framework designed to generate formally
verifiable geometric solutions from textual descriptions and visual diagrams.
Geoint-R1 uniquely integrates auxiliary elements construction, formal reasoning
represented via Lean4, and interactive visualization. To systematically
evaluate and advance formal geometric reasoning, we propose the Geoint
benchmark, comprising 1,885 rigorously annotated geometry problems across
diverse topics such as plane, spatial, and solid geometry. Each problem
includes structured textual annotations, precise Lean4 code for auxiliary
constructions, and detailed solution steps verified by experts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Geoint-R1 significantly surpasses existing
multimodal and math-specific reasoning models, particularly on challenging
problems requiring explicit auxiliary element constructions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种全历史图模型（full-history graph）和ETDNet网络，用于建模实体间随时间演化的交互关系，并在驾驶意图预测和比特币欺诈检测任务中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实任务中需要建模实体间动态交互关系（如交通预测、金融欺诈检测），现有方法通常使用快照图编码时间演化，但无法明确区分结构和时间关系。

Method: 提出全历史图模型，包含节点（每个实体每个时间步）和两类边（同时间步内关系和跨时间步关系），并设计ETDNet网络，通过并行模块分别处理结构和时间信息。

Result: 在Waymo驾驶意图预测（准确率75.6%）和Elliptic++比特币欺诈检测（F1 88.1%）任务中显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过在全历史图中明确区分结构和时间关系，ETDNet能更有效地建模动态交互，提升任务性能。

Abstract: Modeling evolving interactions among entities is critical in many real-world
tasks. For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking
how neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one
another over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on
following the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate
through the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings
demand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a
temporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution
explicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to
encode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates
one node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i)
intra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii)
inter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To
learn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with
parallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along
intra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an
entity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages
after every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin
fraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines,
lifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\% (vs. 74.1\%) and raising Elliptic++
illicit-class F1 to 88.1\% (vs. 60.4\%). These gains demonstrate the benefit of
representing structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single
graph.

Result: 微调的7B LFMs在ToolVQA测试集上表现优异，并在OOD数据集上超越GPT-3.5-turbo。

Conclusion: ToolVQA和ToolEngine有效提升了模型在真实世界工具使用任务中的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Integrating external tools into Large Foundation Models (LFMs) has emerged as
a promising approach to enhance their problem-solving capabilities. While
existing studies have demonstrated strong performance in tool-augmented Visual
Question Answering (VQA), recent benchmarks reveal significant gaps in
real-world tool-use proficiency, particularly in functionally diverse
multimodal settings requiring multi-step reasoning. In this work, we introduce
ToolVQA, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 23K instances, designed to
bridge this gap. Unlike previous datasets that rely on synthetic scenarios and
simplified queries, ToolVQA features real-world visual contexts and challenging
implicit multi-step reasoning tasks, better aligning with real user
interactions. To construct this dataset, we propose ToolEngine, a novel data
generation pipeline that employs Depth-First Search (DFS) with a dynamic
in-context example matching mechanism to simulate human-like tool-use
reasoning. ToolVQA encompasses 10 multimodal tools across 7 diverse task
domains, with an average inference length of 2.78 reasoning steps per instance.
The fine-tuned 7B LFMs on ToolVQA not only achieve impressive performance on
our test set but also surpass the large close-sourced model GPT-3.5-turbo on
various out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, demonstrating strong
generalizability to real-world tool-use scenarios.

TL;DR: Nemori是一种新型自组织记忆架构，通过两步对齐原则和预测校准原则解决LLMs在长期交互中的记忆限制，显著优于现有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在长期交互中因缺乏持久记忆而受限，现有记忆系统依赖被动规则，无法实现真正学习和进化。

Method: 提出Nemori架构，采用两步对齐原则（基于事件分割理论）和预测校准原则（基于自由能原理），自主组织语义连贯的记忆单元并主动学习。

Result: 在LoCoMo和LongMemEval基准测试中，Nemori显著优于现有系统，尤其在长上下文场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: Nemori为自主代理的长期动态工作流提供了可行解决方案，解决了记忆粒度和自适应学习的核心问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet their
inability to maintain persistent memory in long contexts limits their
effectiveness as autonomous agents in long-term interactions. While existing
memory systems have made progress, their reliance on arbitrary granularity for
defining the basic memory unit and passive, rule-based mechanisms for knowledge
extraction limits their capacity for genuine learning and evolution. To address
these foundational limitations, we present Nemori, a novel self-organizing
memory architecture inspired by human cognitive principles. Nemori's core
innovation is twofold: First, its Two-Step Alignment Principle, inspired by
Event Segmentation Theory, provides a principled, top-down method for
autonomously organizing the raw conversational stream into semantically
coherent episodes, solving the critical issue of memory granularity. Second,
its Predict-Calibrate Principle, inspired by the Free-energy Principle, enables
the agent to proactively learn from prediction gaps, moving beyond pre-defined
heuristics to achieve adaptive knowledge evolution. This offers a viable path
toward handling the long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents.
Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that
Nemori significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art systems, with its

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对动态边缘环境中基于LLM的AI代理的系统化部署与管理方案，通过自适应框架优化资源利用和QoS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM（如ChatGPT和Claude）的兴起，需要能够实时处理任务的AI代理。但将数据密集型、多模态边缘工作负载迁移到云端会引入显著延迟，而边缘部署又面临资源有限和异构性的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种自适应框架，结合蚁群算法和基于LLM的优化，建模资源约束和延迟/成本，实现高效决策和轻量级代理迁移。

Result: 在分布式系统（AgentScope）上实现并验证，显著降低了部署延迟和迁移成本。

Conclusion: 该方案为动态边缘环境中LLM-based AI代理的高效部署和管理提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of LLMs such as ChatGPT and Claude fuels the need for AI agents
capable of real-time task handling. However, migrating data-intensive,
multi-modal edge workloads to cloud data centers, traditionally used for agent
deployment, introduces significant latency. Deploying AI agents at the edge
improves efficiency and reduces latency. However, edge environments present
challenges due to limited and heterogeneous resources. Maintaining QoS for
mobile users necessitates agent migration, which is complicated by the
complexity of AI agents coordinating LLMs, task planning, memory, and external
tools. This paper presents the first systematic deployment and management
solution for LLM-based AI agents in dynamic edge environments. We propose a
novel adaptive framework for AI agent placement and migration in edge
intelligence systems. Our approach models resource constraints and
latency/cost, leveraging ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for
efficient decision-making. It autonomously places agents to optimize resource
utilization and QoS and enables lightweight agent migration by transferring
only essential state. Implemented on a distributed system using AgentScope and
validated across globally distributed edge servers, our solution significantly
reduces deployment latency and migration costs.

<details>

Motivation: LLMs使用CoT提示时生成冗长的思维过程，导致推理成本增加和效率降低。

Method: 引入步骤熵度量冗余，提出两阶段训练策略（SFT和GRPO），结合[SKIP]标记生成压缩的CoT。

Result: 实验显示80%低熵步骤可被剪枝，对准确性影响极小，显著提升效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM实际部署提供了高效解决方案，并深化了对推理结构的理解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting excel at
complex reasoning but generate verbose thought processes with considerable
redundancy, leading to increased inference costs and reduced efficiency. We
introduce a novel CoT compression framework based on step entropy, a metric
that quantifies the informational contribution of individual reasoning steps to
identify redundancy. Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical
validation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that steps with
low entropy are indeed highly redundant. Our experiments reveal that an
astonishing 80\% of low-entropy intermediate steps can be pruned with minor
degradation in the final answer accuracy across DeepSeek-R1-7B, 14B and
Qwen3-8B. This finding sharply contrasts with random or high-entropy pruning,
which severely impairs reasoning performance. Building on this, we propose a
novel two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning. This approach
enables LLMs to autonomously learn to generate compressed COTs during inference
by strategically incorporating [SKIP] tokens. Our method significantly enhances
LLM inference efficiency while rigorously preserving accuracy, offering
profound implications for practical LLM deployment and a deeper understanding
of reasoning structures.

Motivation: 当前认知障碍自动评估方法在不同语言和临床环境中通用性不足，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出CogBench基准，使用统一的多模态流程评估LLMs在英语和普通话数据集（ADReSSo、NCMMSC2021-AD、CIR-E）上的表现，并探索LoRA微调。

Result: 传统深度学习模型跨领域性能显著下降，LLMs表现更优但受提示设计影响，LoRA微调显著提升目标领域性能。

Conclusion: 研究为构建临床实用且语言鲁棒的认知评估工具提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Automatic assessment of cognitive impairment from spontaneous speech offers a
promising, non-invasive avenue for early cognitive screening. However, current
approaches often lack generalizability when deployed across different languages
and clinical settings, limiting their practical utility. In this study, we
propose CogBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-lingual
and cross-site generalizability of large language models (LLMs) for
speech-based cognitive impairment assessment. Using a unified multimodal
pipeline, we evaluate model performance on three speech datasets spanning
English and Mandarin: ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, and a newly collected test set,
CIR-E. Our results show that conventional deep learning models degrade
substantially when transferred across domains. In contrast, LLMs equipped with
chain-of-thought prompting demonstrate better adaptability, though their
performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Furthermore, we explore
lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which
significantly improves generalization in target domains. These findings offer a
critical step toward building clinically useful and linguistically robust
speech-based cognitive assessment tools.

Result: 混合方法（LLM-SS）在通用逻辑推理中更具潜力，因其可解释性和保留LLM优势。

Conclusion: 提出基于LLM-SS的通用框架，支持未来混合方法的研究，具有模块化、模型无关和领域无关的特点。

Abstract: General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on
domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models
(LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not
interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in
neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We
first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical
reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic
reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach
comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,
performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on
domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on
domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there
has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the
following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general
logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class
domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses
the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the
hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each
approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising
for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is
more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of
existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a
generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,
model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.

TL;DR: 提出UML2Dep框架，利用形式化规范解决自然语言描述代码生成中的模糊性问题，通过增强UML序列图和数据依赖推理任务提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言描述在代码生成中存在模糊性，难以捕捉复杂需求和隐式数据依赖。

Method: 1. 引入增强的UML序列图，结合决策表和API规范；2. 提出数据依赖推理任务（DDI），构建显式数据依赖图。

Result: 通过形式化规范和DDI任务，显著减少了模糊性，提高了代码生成的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: UML2Dep框架有效解决了复杂需求下的代码生成问题，为LLMs在服务导向架构中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language
(NL) descriptions. However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently
ambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system
behaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data
dependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and
handle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code
generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal
specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified
Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented
architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating
decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural
relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously
eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data
flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI
systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual
code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained
mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with
LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and
dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load
associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy
and efficiency.

<details>

Motivation: 大语言模型在推理和生成方面表现出色，但在识别和诊断复杂错误方面仍有不足，主要因为训练目标偏向正确答案，缺乏对错误的学习。

Method: 提出HSG框架，包含两个对抗角色：Sneaky生成隐蔽的错误，Diagnosis负责检测。通过对抗协同进化提升错误隐蔽性和诊断准确性。

Result: 在多个数学推理任务中，HSG显著提升了错误诊断能力，准确率比GPT-4o等基线模型高16.8%--31.4%。

Conclusion: HSG框架有效提升了大语言模型的错误诊断能力，并发布了具有挑战性的错误数据集作为未来研究基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning and generation across
domains, but still struggle with identifying and diagnosing complex errors.
This stems mainly from training objectives that prioritize correct answers,
limiting exposure to and learning from errors. While recent studies have begun
to address this by introducing error signals, most rely on shallow, static
errors, restricting improvement in deep diagnostic ability. To overcome this,
we propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error
generation and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving. HSG
involves two adversarial roles: Sneaky, which "hides" by generating subtle,
deceptive reasoning errors, and Diagnosis, which "seeks" to accurately detect
them. Through adversarial co-evolution, both error stealth and diagnostic
precision are enhanced. Experiments on several math reasoning tasks show that
HSG significantly boosts error diagnosis, achieving 16.8\%--31.4\% higher
accuracy than baselines like GPT-4o. We also release a challenging dataset of
deceptive errors and diagnostic annotations as a benchmark for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的路由问题常因用户提出的冲突或不合理需求导致模型不可行，现有LLM方法未能全面考虑多种调整可能性。

Method: MOID结合LLM代理和多目标优化，生成权衡路径成本和约束违反的解决方案，并通过LLM分析这些方案以提供诊断建议。

Result: 在50种不可行路由问题上，MOID能单次运行生成多种诊断建议，比现有方法更实用。

Conclusion: MOID通过多目标优化和LLM分析，显著提升了诊断不可行模型的效率和实用性。

Abstract: In real-world routing problems, users often propose conflicting or
unreasonable requirements, which result in infeasible optimization models due
to overly restrictive or contradictory constraints, leading to an empty
feasible solution set. Existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods
attempt to diagnose infeasible models, but modifying such models often involves
multiple potential adjustments that these methods do not consider. To fill this
gap, we introduce Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis (MOID), which
combines LLM agents and multi-objective optimization within an automatic
routing solver, to provide a set of representative actionable suggestions.
Specifically, MOID employs multi-objective optimization to consider both path
cost and constraint violation, generating a set of trade-off solutions, each
encompassing varying degrees of model adjustments. To extract practical
insights from these solutions, MOID utilizes LLM agents to generate a solution
analysis function for the infeasible model. This function analyzes these
distinct solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users
with diverse diagnostic insights and suggestions. Finally, we compare MOID with
several LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems. The
results indicate that MOID automatically generates multiple diagnostic
suggestions in a single run, providing more practical insights for restoring
model feasibility and decision-making compared to existing methods.

Result: 提取的增强三元组生成的自然语言句子与原命题的平均余弦相似度为0.874，优于普通三元组。LLM还能推断新关系并连接知识图谱中的知识簇。

Conclusion: 该方法为医学从业者提供了集中、实时更新的可持续知识源，并可能在其他领域实现类似效果。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge
for clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of
scientific literature and its applications. The steady growth of studies and
findings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to
systematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents
an approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)
generation to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of
large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts
into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from
these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain
and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate
ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during
extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming
`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing
natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original
propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity
for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated
sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context
variable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new
relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge
graph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a
centralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be
the foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.

Motivation: 传统信念系统表示方法（如概率分布或逻辑框架）忽视了信念内部结构，混淆了外部可信度与内部一致性，无法建模矛盾或碎片化的认知状态。

Method: 采用有向加权图表示信念系统，节点为信念，边为认知关系（如支持或矛盾），并分别用可信度和置信度量化信念的强度和结构支持。

Result: 该方法不依赖先验一致性或信念更新，支持细粒度结构表示，避免了逻辑框架的二值化或演绎封闭限制。

Conclusion: 该形式化为分析信念系统的内部组织（如一致性、认知张力）提供了基础，优于现有概率、逻辑或论证方法。

Abstract: Belief systems are often treated as globally consistent sets of propositions
or as scalar-valued probability distributions. Such representations tend to
obscure the internal structure of belief, conflate external credibility with
internal coherence, and preclude the modeling of fragmented or contradictory
epistemic states. This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems
as directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual
beliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),
and two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source
trust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike
classical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or
require belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it
supports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary
justification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and
deliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a
foundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief
systems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and
representational limits. By distinguishing belief structure from belief
strength, this formalism enables a richer classification of epistemic states
than existing probabilistic, logical, or argumentation-based approaches.

Motivation: 智能家居模型通常基于静态数据集训练，难以应对行为漂移（如季节变化、生活方式改变等），而新数据收集又面临速度慢、成本高和隐私问题。

Method: SmartGen包含四个关键组件：时间和语义感知分割、语义感知序列压缩、图引导序列合成和两阶段异常值过滤。

Result: 实验表明，SmartGen显著提升了行为漂移下的异常检测和行为预测性能，平均提升分别为85.43%和70.51%。

Conclusion: SmartGen通过生成高质量的行为数据，有效解决了智能家居模型的行为漂移问题。

Abstract: As smart homes become increasingly prevalent, intelligent models are widely
used for tasks such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction. These models
are typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral
drift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines.
However, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due
to its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose
SmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior
data to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen
consists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware
Split module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically
coherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose
Semantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving
representative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third,
we introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior
relationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the
LLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core
behavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify
and remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve
the factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences.
Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen
significantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior
prediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by
85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average. The code is available at

Motivation: LLMs在多步推理中常产生错误，且难以遵守特定输出格式，影响数学表达式或代码生成任务。

Method: EDCIM结合轻量级和强大LLMs，生成方程组并通过符号化框架检测错误，提供反馈以修正。

Result: 实验表明EDCIM显著降低成本，同时保持或提高准确性。

Conclusion: EDCIM为数学任务提供了一种高效且准确的错误检测与修正方法。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to perform
explicit multi-step reasoning such as chain-of-thought prompting. However,
their intermediate steps often contain errors that can propagate leading to
inaccurate final predictions. Additionally, LLMs still struggle with
hallucinations and often fail to adhere to prescribed output formats, which is
particularly problematic for tasks like generating mathematical expressions or
source code. This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for
Interpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors
in interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact
functional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural
language) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a
system of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection
framework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based
correction. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source
LLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This
balance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the
trade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements. Experimental results
across different datasets show that EDCIM significantly reduces both
computational and financial costs, while maintaining, and even improving,
prediction accuracy when the balance is properly configured.

Result: 发现大规模激活值的发展遵循可预测数学模式，机器学习框架能高精度预测稳态行为。

Conclusion: 大规模激活值的出现可由模型设计预测和控制，对模型稳定性、训练周期等有重要意义。

Abstract: Massive activations are scalar values in transformer hidden states that
achieve values orders of magnitude larger than typical activations and have
been shown to be critical for model functionality. While prior work has
characterized these phenomena in fully trained models, the temporal dynamics of
their emergence during training remain poorly understood. We present the first
comprehensive analysis of massive activation development throughout transformer
training, using the Pythia model family as our testbed. Through systematic
analysis of various model sizes across multiple training checkpoints, we
demonstrate that massive activation emergence follows predictable mathematical
patterns that can be accurately modeled using an exponentially-modulated
logarithmic function with five key parameters. We develop a machine learning
framework to predict these mathematical parameters from architectural
specifications alone, achieving high accuracy for steady-state behavior and
moderate accuracy for emergence timing and magnitude. These findings enable
architects to predict and potentially control key aspects of massive activation
emergence through design choices, with significant implications for model
stability, training cycle length, interpretability, and optimization. Our
findings demonstrate that the emergence of massive activations is governed by
model design and can be anticipated, and potentially controlled, before
training begins.

(LLMs), their reliance on input premises has intensified. When users provide
inputs containing faulty premises, the probability of code generation
hallucinations rises significantly, exposing deficiencies in their
self-scrutiny capabilities. This paper proposes Faulty Premises Bench
(FPBench), the first code generation evaluation framework targeting faulty
premises. By systematically constructing three categories of faulty premises
and integrating multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, it conducts in-depth
assessments of 15 representative LLMs. The key findings are as follows: (1)
Most models exhibit poor reasoning abilities and suboptimal code generation
performance under faulty premises, heavily relying on explicit prompts for
error detection, with limited self-scrutiny capabilities; (2) Faulty premises
trigger a point of diminishing returns in resource investment, leading to
blindly increasing length fails to enhance quality; (3) The three types of
faulty premises respectively activate distinct defect patterns in models,
revealing a triple dissociation in the cognitive mechanisms of code generation
models. This study not only highlights the urgent need for LLMs to proactively
verify premises in code generation but also, through the proposed FPBench
framework and multi-dimensional evaluation system, provides a theoretical
foundation and practical pathway for developing reliable, human-centric code
generation models.

Conclusion: Evo-MCTS不仅提升了性能，还为计算科学领域的自动化算法发现提供了可转移的方法。

Abstract: Computational scientific discovery increasingly relies on algorithms to
process complex data and identify meaningful patterns - yet faces persistent
challenges in gravitational-wave signal identification. While existing
algorithmic approaches like matched filtering (MF) and deep neural networks
(DNNs) have achieved partial success, their limitations directly stem from
fundamental limitations: MF's excessive computational demands arise from its
reliance on predefined theoretical waveform templates, while DNNs' black-box
architectures obscure decision logic and introduce hidden biases. We propose
Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), a framework that addresses
these limitations through systematic algorithm space exploration guided by
domain-aware physical constraints. Our approach combines tree-structured search
with evolutionary optimization and large language model heuristics to create
interpretable algorithmic solutions. Our Evo-MCTS framework demonstrates
substantial improvements, achieving a 20.2\% improvement over state-of-the-art
gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset.
High-performing algorithm variants consistently exceed thresholds. The
framework generates human-interpretable algorithmic pathways that reveal
distinct performance patterns. Beyond performance improvements, our framework
discovers novel algorithmic combinations, thereby establishing a transferable
methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science
domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将RL训练与代理紧密耦合或依赖于序列拼接与掩码，限制了灵活性和扩展性。Agent Lightning旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过将代理执行建模为马尔可夫决策过程，定义统一数据接口，并提出分层RL算法LightningRL，包含信用分配模块。系统设计采用训练-代理解耦架构。

Result: 在文本到SQL、检索增强生成和数学工具使用任务中展示了稳定且持续的改进。

Conclusion: Agent Lightning为现实世界代理训练和部署提供了潜力巨大的框架。

Abstract: We present Agent Lightning, a flexible and extensible framework that enables
Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
any AI agent. Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with
agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves
complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless
integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using
frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from
scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as
Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a
hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment
module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into
training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such
as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we
introduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent
observability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent
finetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented
generation, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous
improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent
training and deployment.

*Patrick Paetzold,Rebecca Kehlbeck,Yumeng Xue,Bin Chen,Yunhai Wang,Oliver Deussen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据相似性的Voronoi树图算法，通过预处理、匹配和优化步骤生成保留邻域关系的树图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Voronoi树图仅展示层次结构，而数据属性（如相似性）常被忽略，需要一种方法同时保留层次和相似性。

Method: 扩展树图布局流程，利用Kuhn-Munkres匹配和贪婪交换优化邻域关系，迭代调整单元格大小。

Result: 通过实际案例验证了方法的实用性，定量评估显示邻域关系得到有效保留。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合层次结构和数据相似性，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Voronoi treemaps are used to depict nodes and their hierarchical
relationships simultaneously. However, in addition to the hierarchical
structure, data attributes, such as co-occurring features or similarities,
frequently exist. Examples include geographical attributes like shared borders
between countries or contextualized semantic information such as embedding
vectors derived from large language models. In this work, we introduce a
Voronoi treemap algorithm that leverages data similarity to generate
neighborhood-preserving treemaps. First, we extend the treemap layout pipeline
to consider similarity during data preprocessing. We then use a Kuhn-Munkres
matching of similarities to centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) cells to
create initial Voronoi diagrams with equal cell sizes for each level. Greedy
swapping is used to improve the neighborhoods of cells to match the data's
similarity further. During optimization, cell areas are iteratively adjusted to
their respective sizes while preserving the existing neighborhoods. We
demonstrate the practicality of our approach through multiple real-world
examples drawn from infographics and linguistics. To quantitatively assess the
resulting treemaps, we employ treemap metrics and measure neighborhood
preservation.

TL;DR: READ是一个基于扩散-Transformer的实时说话头生成框架，通过压缩视频和语音潜在空间以及异步噪声调度器，显著提高了生成速度和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在说话头生成中取得了进展，但推理速度过慢限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用时间VAE压缩视频潜在空间，预训练SpeechAE对齐音频-视频潜在空间，设计A2V-DiT主干进行高效合成，并引入异步噪声调度器（ANS）优化训练和推理。

Result: READ在生成质量和速度上优于现有方法，并在长时间生成中保持稳定性。

Conclusion: READ实现了实时说话头生成，平衡了速度与质量，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the
field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow
inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based
talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first
real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our
approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via
a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate
generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed
latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to
generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video
latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully
designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient
talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and
accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous
noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our
framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous
motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated
video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with
significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and
speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.
