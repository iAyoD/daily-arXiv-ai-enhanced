In this proof-of-concept paper, we introduce inclusion analytics, a discourse-based framework for examining inclusion as a dynamic, interactional process in CPS. We conceptualize inclusion along three complementary dimensions -- participation equity, affective climate, and epistemic equity -- and demonstrate how these constructs can be made analytically visible using scalable, interaction-level measures. Using both simulated conversations and empirical data from human-AI teaming experiments, we illustrate how inclusion analytics can surface patterns of participation, relational dynamics, and idea uptake that remain invisible to aggregate or post-hoc evaluations. This work represents an initial step toward process-oriented approaches to measuring inclusion in human-AI collaborative learning environments."}

While current explanations often point to increased test-time computation or structural guidance, establishing a consistent, quantifiable link between these factors and generalization remains challenging. In this work, we identify intrinsic dimensionality as a quantitative measure for characterizing the effectiveness of reasoning chains. Intrinsic dimensionality quantifies the minimum number of model dimensions needed to reach a given accuracy threshold on a given task. By keeping the model architecture fixed and varying the task formulation through different reasoning strategies, we demonstrate that effective reasoning strategies consistently reduce the intrinsic dimensionality of the task. Validating this on GSM8K with Gemma-3 1B and 4B, we observe a strong inverse correlation between the intrinsic dimensionality of a reasoning strategy and its generalization performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Our findings suggest that effective reasoning chains facilitate learning by better compressing the task using fewer parameters, offering a new quantitative metric for analyzing reasoning processes."}

Abrupt shifts in topics can lead to poor user experiences and inefficient utilization of computational resources. In this paper, we present a topic continuity model aimed at assessing whether a response aligns with the initial conversation topic. Our model is built upon the expansion of the corresponding natural language understanding (NLU) model into quantifiable terms using a Naive Bayes approach. Subsequently, we have introduced an attention mechanism and logarithmic nonlinearity to enhance its capability to capture topic continuity. This approach allows us to convert the NLU model into an interpretable analytical formula. In contrast to many NLU models constrained by token limits, our proposed model can seamlessly handle conversations of any length with linear time complexity. Furthermore, the attention mechanism significantly improves the model's ability to identify topic continuity in complex conversations. According to our experiments, our model consistently outperforms traditional methods, particularly in handling lengthy and intricate conversations. This unique capability offers us an opportunity to ensure the responsible and interpretable use of LLMs."}

The TDCR under consideration is a two-segment robot driven by eight tendons, with four tendon actuators per segment.

To determine the robot's feasible static workspace, a genetic algorithm optimization approach is employed to maximize a Euclidian norm of the TDCR's tip position over the workspace. During the simulations, the robot is subjected to external loads, including torques and forces. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying optimal tendon forces to maximize the feasible static workspace, even under the influence of external forces and torques."}

Our method requires no auxiliary models or external annotation, instead importance is estimated directly from the policy model's own probability shifts. Experiments on GSM8K across three models spanning the Qwen and Llama families demonstrate consistent improvements over uniform baselines and faster convergence to equivalent accuracy. Inverting the importance signal hurts performance, confirming we capture genuine causal structure rather than noise.

Through a comprehensive study on the JRDB dataset and another new dataset for social navigation with 360-degree panoramic videos, we find that focusing on lower-body 3D keypoints yields a 13% reduction in Average Displacement Error and augmenting 3D keypoint inputs with corresponding biomechanical cues provides a further 1-4% improvement. Notably, the performance gain persists when using 2D keypoint inputs extracted from equirectangular panoramic images, indicating that monocular surround vision can capture informative cues for motion forecasting.

This imbalance is not necessarily due to hardware limitations, but rather to the absence of principled control frameworks that explain when and how additional legs improve locomotion performance. In multi-legged systems, coordinating many simultaneous contacts introduces a severe curse of dimensionality that challenges existing modeling and control approaches. As an alternative, multi-legged robots are typically controlled using low-dimensional gaits originally developed for bipeds or quadrupeds. These strategies fail to exploit the new symmetries and control opportunities that emerge in higher-dimensional systems. In this work, we develop a principled framework for discovering new control structures in multi-legged locomotion. We use geometric mechanics to reduce contact-rich locomotion planning to a graph optimization problem, and propose a spin model duality framework from statistical mechanics to exploit symmetry breaking and guide optimal gait reorganization. Using this approach, we identify an asymmetric locomotion strategy for a hexapod robot that achieves a forward speed of 0.61 body lengths per cycle (a 50% improvement over conventional gaits). The resulting asymmetry appears at both the control and hardware levels. At the control level, the body orientation oscillates asymmetrically between fast clockwise and slow counterclockwise turning phases for forward locomotion. At the hardware level, two legs on the same side remain unactuated and can be replaced with rigid parts without degrading performance. Numerical simulations and robophysical experiments validate the framework and reveal novel locomotion behaviors that emerge from symmetry reforming in high-dimensional embodied systems."}

Using a multi-agent, LLM-assisted thematic analysis grounded in Braun and Clarke's reflexive framework, we identify 14 recurring thematic categories and synthesize them into five higher-order experiential dimensions. To further characterize affective patterns, we apply emotion labeling using a BERT-based classifier and visualize emotional profiles across dimensions. Our findings reveal five empirically derived experiential dimensions of AI-related psychological risk grounded in real-world user discourse, with self-regulation difficulties emerging as the most prevalent and fear concentrated in concerns related to autonomy, control, and technical risk.

Treating LLMs as virtual informants, we probe their dialectal knowledge using two survey-style question formats: Yes-No questions and multiple-choice questions. To this end, we exploited a large-scale, expert-curated database of Spanish lexical variation. Our evaluation covers more than 900 lexical items across 21 Spanish-speaking countries and is conducted at both the country and dialectal area levels. Across both evaluation formats, the results reveal systematic differences in how LLMs represent Spanish language varieties. Lexical variation associated with Spain, Equatorial Guinea, Mexico & Central America, and the La Plata River is recognized more accurately by the models, while the Chilean variety proves particularly difficult for the models to distinguish. Importantly, differences in the volume of country-level digital resources do not account for these performance patterns, suggesting that factors beyond data quantity shape dialectal representation in LLMs. By providing a fine-grained, large-scale evaluation of geographic lexical variation, this work advances empirical understanding of dialectal knowledge in LLMs and contributes new evidence to discussions of Digital Linguistic Bias in Spanish."}

Derived from an analysis of existing robots, the framework supports structured exploration of diverse robot forms. To operationalize the framework, we developed Morphology Exploration Blocks (MEB), a set of tangible blocks that enable hands-on, collaborative experimentation with robot morphologies.

Among these, POS tag projection with word alignment method transfers POS tags from a high-resource source language to a low-resource target language based on parallel corpora, making it particularly suitable for low-resource language settings. However, this approach relies heavily on parallel corpora, which are often unavailable for many low-resource languages. To overcome this limitation, we propose a fully unsupervised cross-lingual part-of-speech(POS) tagging framework that relies solely on monolingual corpora by leveraging unsupervised neural machine translation(UNMT) system. This UNMT system first translates sentences from a high-resource language into a low-resource one, thereby constructing pseudo-parallel sentence pairs. Then, we train a POS tagger for the target language following the standard projection procedure based on word alignments. Moreover, we propose a multi-source projection technique to calibrate the projected POS tags on the target side, enhancing to train a more effective POS tagger. We evaluate our framework on 28 language pairs, covering four source languages (English, German, Spanish and French) and seven target languages (Afrikaans, Basque, Finnis, Indonesian, Lithuanian, Portuguese and Turkish). Experimental results show that our method can achieve performance comparable to the baseline cross-lingual POS tagger with parallel sentence pairs, and even exceeds it for certain target languages. Furthermore, our proposed multi-source projection technique further boosts performance, yielding an average improvement of 1.3% over previous methods."}

This study introduces a hybrid risk-aware navigation architecture that integrates probabilistic modeling of obstacles along the vehicle path with smooth trajectory optimization for autonomous surface vessels. The system constructs probabilistic risk maps that capture both obstacle proximity and the behavior of dynamic objects. A risk-biased Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) planner leverages these maps to generate collision-free paths, which are subsequently refined using B-spline algorithms to ensure trajectory continuity. Three distinct RRT* rewiring modes are implemented based on the cost function: minimizing the path length, minimizing risk, and optimizing a combination of the path length and total risk. The framework is evaluated in experimental scenarios containing both static and dynamic obstacles. The results demonstrate the system's ability to navigate safely, maintain smooth trajectories, and dynamically adapt to changing environmental risks. Compared with conventional LIDAR or vision-only navigation approaches, the proposed method shows improvements in operational safety and autonomy, establishing it as a promising solution for risk-aware autonomous vehicle missions in uncertain and dynamic environments."}

A legible trajectory allows an observer to quickly and accurately predict an agent's intention. In adversarial environments, such as in military operations or games, it is important for a robot to not communicate its intentions to observers. An illegible trajectory leads an observer to incorrectly predict the agent's intention or delays when an observer is able to make a correct prediction about the agent's intention. However, in some environments there are multiple observers, each of whom may be able to see only part of the environment, and each of whom may have different motives. In this work, we introduce the Mixed-Motive Limited-Observability Legible Motion Planning (MMLO-LMP) problem, which requires a motion planner to generate a trajectory that is legible to observers with positive motives and illegible to observers with negative motives while also considering the visibility limitations of each observer. We highlight multiple strategies an agent can take while still achieving the problem objective. We also present DUBIOUS, a trajectory optimizer that solves MMLO-LMP. Our results show that DUBIOUS can generate trajectories that balance legibility with the motives and limited visibility regions of the observers. Future work includes many variations of MMLO-LMP, including moving observers and observer teaming."}

We quantify skill- and modality-dependent differences in gaze organization and evaluate the substitutability of passive gaze for operative supervision using fixation density overlap analyses and single-frame saliency modeling. Across settings, MSI-Net produced stable, interpretable predictions, whereas SalGAN was unstable and often poorly aligned with human fixations. Models trained on passive gaze recovered a substantial portion of intermediate active attention, but with predictable degradation, and transfer was asymmetric between active and passive targets. Notably, novice passive labels approximated intermediate-passive targets with limited loss on higher-quality demonstrations, suggesting a practical path for scalable, crowd-sourced gaze supervision in surgical coaching and perception modeling."}

Their output constitutes an approximation of statistically dominant word patterns. And yet, the drafting of contracts is often presented as a typical legal task that could be facilitated by this technology. This paper seeks to put an end to such unreasonable ideas. Predicting words differs from using language in the circumstances of specific transactions and reconstituting common contractual phrases differs from reasoning about the law. LLMs seem to be able to generate generic and superficially plausible contractual documents. In the cold light of day, such documents may turn out to be useless assemblages of inconsistent provisions or contracts that are enforceable but unsuitable for a given transaction. This paper casts a shadow on the simplistic assumption that LLMs threaten the continued viability of the legal industry."}

We then screen out a subset from the model's original vocabulary, which is biased towards representing the source language(e.g. English), and utilize bilingual dictionaries to initialize the representations of the expanded vocabulary. Subsequently, we continue to pre-train the mPLMs using the target language corpus, based on the representations of these expanded vocabulary. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline, which uses randomly initialized expanded vocabulary for continued pre-training, in POS tagging and NER tasks, achieving improvements by 0.54% and 2.60%, respectively.

We propose CAPER, a framework for Constrained And ProcEdural Reasoning for robotic scientific experiments, which explicitly restricts where learning and reasoning occur in the planning and control pipeline. Rather than strengthening end-to-end policies, CAPER enforces a responsibility-separated structure: task-level reasoning generates procedurally valid action sequences under explicit constraints, mid-level multimodal grounding realizes subtasks without delegating spatial decision-making to large language models, and low-level control adapts to physical uncertainty via reinforcement learning with minimal demonstrations. By encoding procedural commitments through interpretable intermediate representations, CAPER prevents execution-time violations of experimental logic, improving controllability, robustness, and data efficiency. Experiments on a scientific workflow benchmark and a public long-horizon manipulation dataset demonstrate consistent improvements in success rate and procedural correctness, particularly in low-data and long-horizon settings."}

However, moral psychology research has shown that human moral judgements are sensitive to morally irrelevant situational factors, such as smelling cinnamon rolls or the level of ambient noise, thereby challenging moral theories that assume the stability of human moral judgements. Here, we draw inspiration from this \"situationist\" view of moral psychology to evaluate whether LLMs exhibit similar cognitive moral biases to humans. We curate a novel multimodal dataset of 60 \"moral distractors\" from existing psychological datasets of emotionally-valenced images and narratives which have no moral relevance to the situation presented. After injecting these distractors into existing moral benchmarks to measure their effects on LLM responses, we find that moral distractors can shift the moral judgements of LLMs by over 30% even in low-ambiguity scenarios, highlighting the need for more contextual moral evaluations and more nuanced cognitive moral modeling of LLMs."}

Smoothing the dynamics yields continuous gradients, but the resulting model mismatch can cause controller failures when executed on real systems. We address this trade-off by planning with smoothed dynamics while explicitly quantifying and compensating for the induced errors, providing formal guarantees of constraint satisfaction and goal reachability on the true hybrid dynamics. Our method smooths both contact dynamics and geometry via a novel differentiable simulator based on convex optimization, which enables us to characterize the discrepancy from the true dynamics as a set-valued deviation. This deviation constrains the optimization of time-varying affine feedback policies through analytical bounds on the system's reachable set, enabling robust constraint satisfaction guarantees for the true closed-loop hybrid dynamics, while relying solely on informative gradients from the smoothed dynamics. We evaluate our method on several contact-rich tasks, including planar pushing, object rotation, and in-hand dexterous manipulation, achieving guaranteed constraint satisfaction with lower safety violation and goal error than baselines. By bridging differentiable physics with set-valued robust control, our method is the first certifiable gradient-based policy synthesis method for contact-rich manipulation."}

To mitigate this issue, Difficulty-Adaptive Self-Consistency (DSC) was proposed to reduce unnecessary token usage for easy problems by adjusting the number of samples according to problem difficulty. However, DSC requires additional model calls and pre-sampling to estimate difficulty, and this process is repeated when applying to each dataset, leading to significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose Activation-Informed Difficulty-Aware Self-Consistency (ACTSC) to address these limitations. ACTSC leverages internal difficulty signals reflected in the feed-forward network neuron activations to construct a lightweight difficulty estimation probe, without any additional token generation or model calls. The probe dynamically adjusts the number of samples for SC and can be applied to new datasets without requiring pre-sampling for difficulty estimation. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct experiments on five benchmarks. Experimental results show that ACTSC effectively reduces inference costs while maintaining accuracy relative to existing methods."}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, which retrieve external knowledge sources to enhance the generative capabilities of LLMs, remain susceptible to the same bias-related challenges. This work focuses on evaluating and understanding the social bias implications of RAG. Through extensive experiments across various retrieval corpora, LLMs, and bias evaluation datasets, encompassing more than 13 different bias types, we surprisingly observe a reduction in bias in RAG. This suggests that the inclusion of external context can help counteract stereotype-driven predictions, potentially improving fairness by diversifying the contextual grounding of the model's outputs. To better understand this phenomenon, we then explore the model's reasoning process by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting into RAG while assessing the faithfulness of the model's CoT. Our experiments reveal that the model's bias inclinations shift between stereotype and anti-stereotype responses as more contextual information is incorporated from the retrieved documents. Interestingly, we find that while CoT enhances accuracy, contrary to the bias reduction observed with RAG, it increases overall bias across datasets, highlighting the need for bias-aware reasoning frameworks that can mitigate this trade-off."}

Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising foundation for robotic laboratories. However, scientific experiments typically involve long-horizon tasks composed of multiple atomic tasks, posing a fundamental challenge to existing VLA models. While VLA models fine-tuned for scientific tasks can reliably execute atomic experimental actions seen during training, they often fail to perform composite tasks formed by reordering and composing these known atomic actions. This limitation arises from a distributional mismatch between training-time atomic tasks and inference-time composite tasks, which prevents VLA models from executing necessary transitional operations between atomic tasks. To address this challenge, we propose an Agentic VLA Inference Plugin for Long-Horizon Tasks in Scientific Experiments. It introduces an LLM-based agentic inference mechanism that intervenes when executing sequential manipulation tasks. By performing explicit transition inference and generating transitional robotic action code, the proposed plugin guides VLA models through missing transitional steps, enabling reliable execution of composite scientific workflows without any additional training. This inference-only intervention makes our method computationally efficient, data-efficient, and well-suited for open-ended and long-horizon robotic laboratory tasks. We build 3D assets of scientific instruments and common scientific operating scenes within an existing simulation environment. In these scenes, we have verified that our method increases the average success rate per atomic task by 42\\% during inference. Furthermore, we show that our method can be easily transferred from the simulation to real scientific laboratories."}

To bridge this gap, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework that grounds LLM reasoning into hierarchical LTL specifications and solves the corresponding Simultaneous Task Allocation and Planning (STAP) problem. Unlike static approaches, our system resolves stochastic environmental changes, such as moving users or updated instructions via a receding horizon planning (RHP) loop with real-time perception, which dynamically refines plans through a hierarchical state space. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in success rate and interaction fluency while minimizing planning latency."}

Based on this, we propose the CoCoA (Confusion and Consistency Aware) decoder, a novel, training-free decoding algorithm that mitigates hallucinations at inference time by listening to these signals in the middle layers. We propose two metrics to quantify this instability in the middle layers, and use it to penalize outputs that exhibit high internal confusion, thereby steering the model towards more internally consistent and factually grounded outputs. We further propose a self-information gated variant, CoCoA-SIG, that dynamically modulates this penalty to selectively target high-surprise, unstable generations. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including question-answering, summarization and code generation demonstrate that CoCoA significantly improves factual correctness across multiple model families (e.g., Llama-3, Qwen-2.5, Mistral).

Diffusion-based policies, while expressive, do not permit conservative likelihood-based updates during fine-tuning because action probabilities are intractable. In contrast, conventional Gaussian policies collapse under multimodality, particularly when actions are executed in chunks, and standard per-step critics fail to align with chunked execution, leading to poor credit assignment. We present SOFT-FLOW, a sample-efficient off-policy fine-tuning framework with normalizing flow (NF) to address these challenges. The normalizing flow policy yields exact likelihoods for multimodal action chunks, allowing conservative, stable policy updates through likelihood regularization and thereby improving sample efficiency. An action-chunked critic evaluates entire action sequences, aligning value estimation with the policy's temporal structure and improving long-horizon credit assignment. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a likelihood-based, multimodal generative policy combined with chunk-level value learning on real robotic hardware. We evaluate SOFT-FLOW on two challenging dexterous manipulation tasks in the real world: cutting tape with scissors retrieved from a case, and in-hand cube rotation with a palm-down grasp -- both of which require precise, dexterous control over long horizons. On these tasks, SOFT-FLOW achieves stable, sample-efficient adaptation where standard methods struggle."}

To address this, we introduce Gt-Margin, a position-wise score derived from ground-truth tokens, defined as the probability margin between the correct token and its strongest alternative. Gt-Margin yields an oracle unmasking order that prioritizes easier positions first under each partially masked state. We demonstrate that leveraging this oracle unmasking order significantly enhances final generation quality, particularly on logical reasoning benchmarks.

We consider that advancing dynamic tactile perception requires a systematic hierarchy of dynamic perception capabilities to guide both data collection and model design. To address the lack of tactile data with rich dynamic information, we present ToucHD, a large-scale hierarchical tactile dataset spanning tactile atomic actions, real-world manipulations, and touch-force paired data.

In this year's edition, the verification pipeline is at the center again with the following tasks: Task 1 on source retrieval for scientific web claims (a follow-up of the 2025 edition), Task 2 on fact-checking numerical and temporal claims, which adds a reasoning component to the 2025 edition, and Task 3, which expands the verification pipeline with generation of full-fact-checking articles. These tasks represent challenging classification and retrieval problems as well as generation challenges at the document and span level, including multilingual settings."}

However, developing a unified controller that robustly supports diverse human motions remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically distill multiple expert policies into a single general policy, which often inevitably leads to performance degradation, particularly on highly dynamic motions. This paper presents TeleGate, a unified whole-body teleoperation framework for humanoid robots that achieves high-precision tracking across various motions while avoiding the performance loss inherent in knowledge distillation. Our key idea is to preserve the full capability of domain-specific expert policies by training a lightweight gating network, which dynamically activates experts in real-time based on proprioceptive states and reference trajectories. Furthermore, to compensate for the absence of future reference trajectories in real-time teleoperation, we introduce a VAE-based motion prior module that extracts implicit future motion intent from historical observations, enabling anticipatory control for motions requiring prediction such as jumping and standing up. We conducted empirical evaluations in simulation and also deployed our technique on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Using only 2.5 hours of motion capture data for training, our TeleGate achieves high-precision real-time teleoperation across diverse dynamic motions (e.g., running, fall recovery, and jumping), significantly outperforming the baseline methods in both tracking accuracy and success rate."}

However, we identify a critical yet underexplored bottleneck in this paradigm, termed Knowledge Integration Decay (KID). Specifically, we observe that as the length of reasoning generated before search grows, models increasingly fail to integrate retrieved evidence into subsequent reasoning steps, limiting performance even when relevant information is available. To address this, we propose Self-Anchored Knowledge Encoding (SAKE), a training-free inference-time strategy designed to stabilize knowledge utilization. By anchoring retrieved knowledge at both the beginning and end of the reasoning process, SAKE prevents it from being overshadowed by prior context, thereby preserving its semantic integrity. Extensive experiments on multi-hop QA and complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SAKE significantly mitigates KID and improves performance, offering a lightweight yet effective solution for knowledge integration in agentic LLMs."}

Current VLN research for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) relies on detailed, pre-specified instructions to guide the UAV along predetermined routes. However, real-world outdoor exploration typically occurs in unknown environments where detailed navigation instructions are unavailable. Instead, only coarse-grained positional or directional guidance can be provided, requiring UAVs to autonomously navigate through continuous planning and obstacle avoidance. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoFly, an end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for autonomous UAV navigation. AutoFly incorporates a pseudo-depth encoder that derives depth-aware features from RGB inputs to enhance spatial reasoning, coupled with a progressive two-stage training strategy that effectively aligns visual, depth, and linguistic representations with action policies. Moreover, existing VLN datasets have fundamental limitations for real-world autonomous navigation, stemming from their heavy reliance on explicit instruction-following over autonomous decision-making and insufficient real-world data. To address these issues, we construct a novel autonomous navigation dataset that shifts the paradigm from instruction-following to autonomous behavior modeling through: (1) trajectory collection emphasizing continuous obstacle avoidance, autonomous planning, and recognition workflows; (2) comprehensive real-world data integration. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoFly achieves a 3.9% higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art VLA baselines, with consistent performance across simulated and real environments."}

Among existing methods, guiding the generation of frozen LLMs through autoregressive reward models (ARMs) to accomplish multi-objective test-time alignment is a low-cost solution. However, these methods typically rely on independent parameters for each preference objective, either by training ARMs independently across preference dimensions, which neglects interactions among preference features, or by training a single ARM with separate feature extraction modules for each preference, which can cause feature entanglement. Both strategies can result in misalignment between generated outputs and user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Preference-Modulated \\& Shared Low-Rank Adaptation (MoSLoRA) for ARM training, which first extracts shared features via a preference-agnostic module and then applies affine transformations to shared features via a preference modulation module conditioned on mixed preference vectors. This design mitigates feature entanglement and enables precise control over preference trade-offs during inference. Building on this, we introduce the Unified Autoregressive Reward Model (UniARM), a novel framework for multi-objective test-time alignment. UniARM jointly models all preference dimensions in a single parameter space, eliminating the need for independent parameters for each preference objective. es on larger-scale LLMs, enhancing its practical usability."}

RANT combines particle-filter localisation, a behaviour-based controller with gradient-driven hotspot exploitation, and a lightweight no-revisit coordination mechanism based on virtual pheromone blocking. We experimentally analyse how team size, localisation fidelity, and coordination influence coverage, hotspot recall, and redundancy.

Yet, most existing studies evaluate RAG methods in isolation and primarily focus on single-turn settings. This paper addresses the lack of a systematic comparison of RAG methods for multi-turn conversational QA, where dialogue history, coreference, and shifting user intent substantially complicate retrieval. We present a comprehensive empirical study of vanilla and advanced RAG methods across eight diverse conversational QA datasets spanning multiple domains. Using a unified experimental setup, we evaluate retrieval quality and answer generation using generator and retrieval metrics, and analyze how performance evolves across conversation turns. Our results show that robust yet straightforward methods, such as reranking, hybrid BM25, and HyDE, consistently outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, several advanced techniques fail to yield gains and can even degrade performance below the No-RAG baseline. We further demonstrate that dataset characteristics and dialogue length strongly influence retrieval effectiveness, explaining why no single RAG strategy dominates across settings. Overall, our findings indicate that effective conversational RAG depends less on method complexity than on alignment between the retrieval strategy and the dataset structure.

This method enables a significant reduction in the search space, without sacrificing path resolution. The framework then performs online motion planning by finding a sequence of rectangles and generating a near-time-optimal, kinematically-feasible trajectory using an analytical planner.

However, existing BDLMs have limited exploration under the test-time scaling setting and face more severe decoding challenges in long Chain-of-Thought reasoning, particularly in balancing the decoding speed and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a unified framework for test-time scaling in BDLMs that introduces adaptivity in both decoding and block-wise generation. At the decoding level, we propose Bounded Adaptive Confidence Decoding (BACD), a difficulty-aware sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts denoising based on model confidence, accelerating inference while controlling error accumulation. Beyond step-wise adaptivity, we introduce Think Coarse, Critic Fine (TCCF), a test-time scaling paradigm that allocates large block sizes to exploratory reasoning and smaller block sizes to refinement, achieving an effective efficiency-effectiveness balance. To enable efficient and effective decoding with a large block size, we adopt Progressive Block Size Extension, which mitigates performance degradation when scaling block sizes. Extensive experiments show that applying BACD and TCCF to TDAR-8B yields significant improvements over strong baselines such as TraDo-8B (2.26x speedup, +11.2 points on AIME24).

We present a systematic, controlled study of VLA scaling that revisits core training choices for pretraining across diverse robots. Using a representative VLA framework that combines a vision-language backbone with flow-matching, we ablate key design decisions under matched conditions and evaluate in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments. To improve the reliability of real-world results, we introduce a Grouped Blind Ensemble protocol that blinds operators to model identity and separates policy execution from outcome judgment, reducing experimenter bias. Our analysis targets three dimensions of VLA scaling. (1) Physical alignment: we show that a unified end-effector (EEF)-relative action representation is critical for robust cross-embodiment transfer. (2) Embodiment mixture: we find that naively pooling heterogeneous robot datasets often induces negative transfer rather than gains, underscoring the fragility of indiscriminate data scaling. (3) Training regularization: we observe that intuitive strategies, such as sensory dropout and multi-stage fine-tuning, do not consistently improve performance at scale. Together, this study challenge some common assumptions about embodied scaling and provide practical guidance for training large-scale VLA policies from diverse robotic data.

To address these challenges, we introduce LEMUR, a large-scale multilingual corpus of EU environmental legislation constructed from 24,953 official EUR-Lex PDF documents covering 25 languages. We quantify the fidelity of PDF-to-text conversion by measuring lexical consistency against authoritative HTML versions using the Lexical Content Score (LCS).

We propose {Budget-Guided MCTS} (BG-MCTS), a tree-search decoding algorithm that aligns its search policy with the remaining token budget: it starts with broad exploration, then prioritizes refinement and answer completion as the budget depletes while reducing late-stage branching from shallow nodes.

In this work, we introduce an Orthogonal Mixture-of-Experts (OMoE) architecture that prevents diverse behaviors from collapsing into overlapping representations, enabling a single policy to master a wide spectrum of locomotion skills. In addition, we design a multi-discriminator framework in which different discriminators operate on distinct observation spaces, effectively mitigating reward hacking.

Counterfactual data augmentation (CDA), a widely used method for fine-tuning, highlights this issue by generating synthetic data that may align poorly with real-world distributions or creating overly simplistic counterfactuals that ignore the social context of altered sensitive attributes (e.g., gender) in the pretraining corpus. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective context-augmented CDA method, Context-CDA, which uses large LMs to enhance the diversity and contextual relevance of the debiasing corpus. By minimizing discrepancies between the debiasing corpus and pretraining data through augmented context, this approach ensures better alignment, enhancing language modeling capability. We then employ uncertainty-based filtering to exclude generated counterfactuals considered low-quality by the target smaller LMs (i.e., LMs to be debiased), further improving the fine-tuning corpus quality. Experimental results on gender bias benchmarks demonstrate that Context-CDA effectively mitigates bias without sacrificing language modeling performance while offering insights into social biases by analyzing distribution shifts in next-token generation probabilities."}

We present TriPilot-FF, an open-source whole-body teleoperation system for a custom bimanual mobile manipulator that introduces a foot-operated pedal with lidar-driven pedal haptics, coupled with upper-body bimanual leader-follower teleoperation.

We demonstrate the capability of TriPilot-FF to effectively ``co-pilot'' the human operator over long time-horizons and tasks requiring precise mobile base movement and coordination.

However, efficient tactile data compression, which is essential for real-time robotic applications under strict bandwidth constraints, remains underexplored. The inherent heterogeneity and spatiotemporal complexity of tactile data further complicate this challenge. To bridge this gap, we introduce TaCo, the first comprehensive benchmark for Tactile data Codecs. TaCo evaluates 30 compression methods, including off-the-shelf compression algorithms and neural codecs, across five diverse datasets from various sensor types. We systematically assess both lossless and lossy compression schemes on four key tasks: lossless storage, human visualization, material and object classification, and dexterous robotic grasping. Notably, we pioneer the development of data-driven codecs explicitly trained on tactile data, TaCo-LL (lossless) and TaCo-L (lossy). Results have validated the superior performance of our TaCo-LL and TaCo-L. This benchmark provides a foundational framework for understanding the critical trade-offs between compression efficiency and task performance, paving the way for future advances in tactile perception."}

We address this gap with a lightweight, fully on-device pipeline that converts natural-language commands into reliable manipulation. Our approach has two stages: (i) the instruction to actions module (Instruct2Act), a compact BiLSTM with a multi-head-attention autoencoder that parses an instruction into an ordered sequence of atomic actions (e.g., reach, grasp, move, place); and (ii) the robot action network (RAN), which uses the dynamic adaptive trajectory radial network (DATRN) together with a vision-based environment analyzer (YOLOv8) to generate precise control trajectories for each sub-action. The entire system runs on a modest system with no cloud services. On our custom proprietary dataset, Instruct2Act attains 91.5% sub-actions prediction accuracy while retaining a small footprint. Real-robot evaluations across four tasks (pick-place, pick-pour, wipe, and pick-give) yield an overall 90% success; sub-action inference completes in < 3.8s, with end-to-end executions in 30-60s depending on task complexity. These results demonstrate that fine-grained instruction-to-action parsing, coupled with DATRN-based trajectory generation and vision-guided grounding, provides a practical path to deterministic, real-time manipulation in resource-constrained, single-camera settings."}

In this study, we evaluate representative KD methods by considering both translation quality and computational cost. We express computational cost as a carbon footprint using the machine learning life cycle assessment (MLCA) tool. This assessment accounts for runtime operational emissions and amortized hardware production costs throughout the KD model life cycle (teacher training, distillation, and inference). We find that (i) distillation overhead dominates the total footprint at small deployment volumes, (ii) inference dominates at scale, making KD beneficial only beyond a task-dependent usage threshold, and (iii) word-level distillation typically offers more favorable footprint-quality trade-offs than sequence-level distillation.

Recent approaches attempt to mitigate these limitations via a plan-then-execute paradigm, where high-level plans (e.g., subtasks, trace) are first generated and subsequently translated into low-level actions, but they critically rely on extra intermediate supervision, which is largely absent from existing datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce the RoboInter Manipulation Suite, a unified resource including data, benchmarks, and models of intermediate representations for manipulation. It comprises RoboInter-Tool, a lightweight GUI that enables semi-automatic annotation of diverse representations, and RoboInter-Data, a large-scale dataset containing over 230k episodes across 571 diverse scenes, which provides dense per-frame annotations over more than 10 categories of intermediate representations, substantially exceeding prior work in scale and annotation quality. Building upon this foundation, RoboInter-VQA introduces 9 spatial and 20 temporal embodied VQA categories to systematically benchmark and enhance the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Meanwhile, RoboInter-VLA offers an integrated plan-then-execute framework, supporting modular and end-to-end VLA variants that bridge high-level planning with low-level execution via intermediate supervision.

A deep neural network detects the presence of a drone and estimates the propeller's rotation speed or blade passing frequency (BPF) from a mel spectrogram.

Existing memory systems often treat interactions as disjointed snippets, failing to capture the underlying narrative coherence of the dialogue stream. We propose TraceMem, a cognitively-inspired framework that weaves structured, narrative memory schemata from user conversational traces through a three-stage pipeline: (1) Short-term Memory Processing, which employs a deductive topic segmentation approach to demarcate episode boundaries and extract semantic representation; (2) Synaptic Memory Consolidation, a process that summarizes episodes into episodic memories before distilling them alongside semantics into user-specific traces; and (3) Systems Memory Consolidation, which utilizes two-stage hierarchical clustering to organize these traces into coherent, time-evolving narrative threads under unifying themes. These threads are encapsulated into structured user memory cards, forming narrative memory schemata. For memory utilization, we provide an agentic search mechanism to enhance reasoning process. Evaluation on the LoCoMo benchmark shows that TraceMem achieves state-of-the-art performance with a brain-inspired architecture.

Existing lane change controllers primarily either ensure safety or collaboratively improve traffic efficiency, but do not consider these conflicting objectives together. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Safety Shield (MASS), designed using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to enable safe and collaborative lane changes. The MASS enables collaboration by capturing multi-agent interactions among CAVs through interaction topologies constructed as a graph using a simple algorithm. Further, a state-of-the-art Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) lane change controller is extended by integrating MASS to ensure safety and defining a customised reward function to prioritise efficiency improvements. As a result, we propose a lane change controller, known as MARL-MASS, and evaluate it in a congested on-ramp merging simulation. The results demonstrate that MASS enables collaborative lane changes with safety guarantees by strictly respecting the safety constraints. Moreover, the proposed custom reward function improves the stability of MARL policies trained with a safety shield. Overall, by encouraging the exploration of a collaborative lane change policy while respecting safety constraints, MARL-MASS effectively balances the trade-off between ensuring safety and improving traffic efficiency in congested traffic.

This paper focuses on a common yet under-explored regime: unsupervised, sample-specific TTA, where the model adapts independently for each prompt using only the prompt itself, without gold answers or external supervision. Although appealing, naive unsupervised TTA with a fixed, handcrafted learning rate can be unstable: updates may overfit to prompt-specific statistics, drift from the desired answer distribution, and ultimately degrade generation quality. This failure mode is not surprising, as in this case TTA must adapt to a single prompt within only a few gradient steps, unlike standard training that averages updates over large datasets and long optimization horizons. Therefore, we propose layer-wise dynamic test-time adaptation, a framework which explicitly modulates TTA strength as a function of prompt representation, LLM structure and adaptation step. In our setting, TTA updates only LoRA parameters, and a lightweight hypernetwork predicts per-layer, per-step learning-rate multipliers, enabling fine-grained control. Experiments across various datasets and LLMs consistently show that our method substantially strengthens TTA by learning effective scaling patterns over adaptation steps and transformer layer projections, improving stability while delivering better performance."}

Failure to modulate force can lead to task failure or irreversible damage to the objects. Humans can precisely achieve this by adapting force from tactile feedback, even within a short period of physical contact. We aim to give robots this capability. However, commercial grippers exhibit high cost or high minimum force, making them unsuitable for studying force-controlled policy learning with everyday force-sensitive objects. We introduce TF-Gripper, a low-cost (~$150) force-controlled parallel-jaw gripper that integrates tactile sensing as feedback. It has an effective force range of 0.45-45N and is compatible with different robot arms. Additionally, we designed a teleoperation device paired with TF-Gripper to record human-applied grasping forces. While standard low-frequency policies can be trained on this data, they struggle with the reactive, contact-dependent nature of force regulation. To overcome this, we propose RETAF (REactive Tactile Adaptation of Force), a framework that decouples grasping force control from arm pose prediction. RETAF regulates force at high frequency using wrist images and tactile feedback, while a base policy predicts end-effector pose and gripper open/close action. We evaluate TF-Gripper and RETAF across five real-world tasks requiring precise force regulation. Results show that compared to position control, direct force control significantly improves grasp stability and task performance. We further show that tactile feedback is essential for force regulation, and that RETAF consistently outperforms baselines and can be integrated with various base policies. We hope this work opens a path for scaling the learning of force-controlled policies in robotic manipulation. Project page: https://force-gripper.github.io ."}

Most studies on LSC focus on improving the performance of estimating the degree of LSC, however, it is often difficult to interpret how the meaning of a word change. Enhancing the interpretability of LSC is a significant challenge as it could lead to novel insights in this field. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method to map the semantic space of contextualized embeddings of words obtained by a pre-trained language model to a neurobiological feature space. In the neurobiological feature space, each dimension corresponds to a primitive feature of words, and its value represents the intensity of that feature. This enables humans to interpret LSC systematically. When employed for the estimation of the degree of LSC, our method demonstrates superior performance in comparison to the majority of the previous methods. In addition, given the high interpretability of the proposed method, several analyses on LSC are carried out. The results demonstrate that our method not only discovers interesting types of LSC that have been overlooked in previous studies but also effectively searches for words with specific types of LSC."}

Unlike conventional machines, humanoids introduce expectations of human-like behavior, communication, and social presence, which reshape usability, trust, and safety considerations. In this article, we introduce the concept of humanoid factors as a framework structured around four pillars - physical, cognitive, social, and ethical - that shape the development of humanoids to help them effectively coexist and collaborate with humans. This framework characterizes the overlap and divergence between human capabilities and those of general-purpose humanoids powered by AI foundation models. To demonstrate our framework's practical utility, we then apply the framework to evaluate a real-world humanoid control algorithm, illustrating how conventional task completion metrics in robotics overlook key human cognitive and interaction principles. We thus position humanoid factors as a foundational framework for designing, evaluating, and governing sustained human-humanoid coexistence."}

However, visuo-tactile perception is critical for contact-rich manipulation, as tasks such as insertion are difficult to complete robustly using vision alone. At the same time, acquiring large-scale and reliable tactile data in the physical world remains costly and challenging, and the lack of a unified evaluation platform further limits policy learning and systematic analysis. To address these challenges, we propose UniVTAC, a simulation-based visuo-tactile data synthesis platform that supports three commonly used visuo-tactile sensors and enables scalable and controllable generation of informative contact interactions. Based on this platform, we introduce the UniVTAC Encoder, a visuo-tactile encoder trained on large-scale simulation-synthesized data with designed supervisory signals, providing tactile-centric visuo-tactile representations for downstream manipulation tasks. In addition, we present the UniVTAC Benchmark, which consists of eight representative visuo-tactile manipulation tasks for evaluating tactile-driven policies. Experimental results show that integrating the UniVTAC Encoder improves average success rates by 17.1% on the UniVTAC Benchmark, while real-world robotic experiments further demonstrate a 25% improvement in task success.

When benchmark metadata provides per-instance workload proxies, we further factor verbosity into two components: mean verbalization overhead (tokens per work unit) and a coupling coefficient capturing how overhead scales with task workload. When reasoning traces are available, we add deterministic trace-quality measures (grounding, repetition, prompt copying) to separate degenerate looping from verbose-but-engaged reasoning, avoiding human labeling and LLM judges. Evaluating 25 models on CogniLoad, we find that accuracy and token-efficiency rankings diverge (Spearman $ρ=0.63$), efficiency gaps are often driven by conditional correctness, and verbalization overhead varies by about 9 times (only weakly related to model scale).

Robo3R jointly infers scale-invariant local geometry and relative camera poses, which are unified into the scene representation in the canonical robot frame via a learned global similarity transformation. To meet the precision demands of manipulation, Robo3R employs a masked point head for sharp, fine-grained point clouds, and a keypoint-based Perspective-n-Point (PnP) formulation to refine camera extrinsics and global alignment. Trained on Robo3R-4M, a curated large-scale synthetic dataset with four million high-fidelity annotated frames, Robo3R consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reconstruction methods and depth sensors.

Existing research mainly focuses on model improvements and sentence-level pruning, but often overlooks global structure, leading to disrupted coherence and weakened downstream performance. Some studies employ large language models (LLMs), which achieve higher accuracy but incur substantial resource and time costs. To address these issues, we introduce GloSA-sum, the first summarization approach that achieves global structure awareness via topological data analysis (TDA). GloSA-sum summarizes text efficiently while preserving semantic cores and logical dependencies. Specifically, we construct a semantic-weighted graph from sentence embeddings, where persistent homology identifies core semantics and logical structures, preserved in a ``protection pool'' as the backbone for summarization. We design a topology-guided iterative strategy, where lightweight proxy metrics approximate sentence importance to avoid repeated high-cost computations, thus preserving structural integrity while improving efficiency. To further enhance long-text processing, we propose a hierarchical strategy that integrates segment-level and global summarization. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that GloSA-sum reduces redundancy while preserving semantic and logical integrity, striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency, and further benefits LLM downstream tasks by shortening contexts while retaining essential reasoning chains."}

To bridge this gap and unleash the potential of large-scale human manipulation video data, we propose DexImit, an automated framework that converts monocular human manipulation videos into physically plausible robot data, without any additional information. DexImit employs a four-stage generation pipeline: (1) reconstructing hand-object interactions from arbitrary viewpoints with near-metric scale; (2) performing subtask decomposition and bimanual scheduling; (3) synthesizing robot trajectories consistent with the demonstrated interactions; (4) comprehensive data augmentation for zero-shot real-world deployment. Building on these designs, DexImit can generate large-scale robot data based on human videos, either from the Internet or video generation models. DexImit is capable of handling diverse manipulation tasks, including tool use (e.g., cutting an apple), long-horizon tasks (e.g., making a beverage), and fine-grained manipulations (e.g., stacking cups)."}

In this work we study cross-lingual transfer of Arabic models using probing on 3 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tasks, and representational similarity. Our results indicate that transfer is possible but disproportionate across dialects, which we find to be partially explained by their geographic proximity. Furthermore, we find evidence for negative interference in models trained to support all Arabic dialects. This questions their degree of similarity, and raises concerns for cross-lingual transfer in Arabic models."}

A portable system for scalable human data collection is developed, and we establish practical collection protocols to improve transferability. At the core of our human-to-humanoid alignment pipeline lies two key components. The view alignment reduces visual domain discrepancies caused by camera height and perspective variation. The action alignment maps human motions into a unified, kinematically feasible action space for humanoid control. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that incorporating robot-free egocentric data significantly outperforms robot-only baselines by 51\\%, particularly in unseen environments.

We investigate whether reasoning generated by LLMs can be used to predict the correctness of a model's own predictions. We analyze 30,300 teacher utterances from classroom dialogue, each labeled by multiple state-of-the-art LLMs with an instructional move construct and an accompanying reasoning. Using human-verified ground-truth labels, we frame the task as predicting whether a model's assigned label for a given utterance is correct. We encode LLM reasoning using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and evaluate five supervised classifiers. A Random Forest classifier achieves an F1 score of 0.83 (Recall = 0.854), successfully identifying most incorrect predictions and outperforming baselines. Training specialist detectors for specific instructional move constructs further improves performance on difficult constructs, indicating that error detection benefits from construct-specific linguistic cues. Using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) framework, we examine four linguistic markers of correctness: Causation, Differentiation, Tentativeness, and Insight. Correct predictions exhibit grounded causal language (e.g., because, therefore), while incorrect reasoning is substantially more likely to rely on epistemic hedging (e.g., might, could) and performative metacognition (e.g., think, realize). Syntactic complexity does not distinguish correct from incorrect reasoning, and longer reasoning is not more reliable. These findings demonstrate that reasoning-based error detection offers a practical and scalable approach to quality control in automated educational dialogue analysis."}

We investigate quantification in Mandarin Chinese using a picture-based elicited description task in which speakers freely described scenes containing multiple objects, without explicit instructions to count or quantify. Across both spoken and written modalities, we examine three aspects of quantification: whether speakers choose to quantify at all, how precise their quantification is, and which quantificational strategies they adopt. Results show that object numerosity, animacy, and production modality systematically shape quantificational behaviour. In particular, increasing numerosity reduces both the likelihood and the precision of quantification, while animate referents and modality selectively modulate strategy choice. This study demonstrates how quantification can be examined under unconstrained production conditions and provides a naturalistic dataset for further analyses of quantity expression in language production."}

However, even with precise modeling, fixed policies remain susceptible to out-of-distribution scenarios, ranging from external aerodynamic disturbances to internal hardware degradation. To ensure safety under these evolving uncertainties, such controllers are forced to operate with conservative safety margins, inherently constraining their agility outside of controlled settings. While online adaptation offers a potential remedy, safely exploring physical limits remains a critical bottleneck due to data scarcity and safety risks. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-adaptive framework that eliminates the need for precise system identification or offline Sim2Real transfer. We introduce Adaptive Temporal Scaling (ATS) to actively explore platform physical limits, and employ online residual learning to augment a simple nominal model. {Based on the learned hybrid model, we further propose Real-world Anchored Short-horizon Backpropagation Through Time (RASH-BPTT) to achieve efficient and robust in-flight policy updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our quadrotor reliably executes agile maneuvers near actuator saturation limits. The system evolves a conservative base policy with a peak speed of 1.9 m/s to 7.3 m/s within approximately 100 seconds of flight time.

We propose Steer2Edit, a theoretically grounded, training-free framework that transforms steering vectors from inference-time control signals into diagnostic signals for component-level rank-1 weight editing. Instead of uniformly injecting a steering direction during generation, Steer2Edit selectively redistributes behavioral influence across individual attention heads and MLP neurons, yielding interpretable edits that preserve the standard forward pass and remain compatible with optimized parallel inference. Across safety alignment, hallucination mitigation, and reasoning efficiency, Steer2Edit consistently achieves more favorable attribute-utility trade-offs: at matched downstream performance, it improves safety by up to 17.2%, increases truthfulness by 9.8%, and reduces reasoning length by 12.2% on average.

However, we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that an agent society satisfying continuous self-evolution, complete isolation, and safety invariance is impossible. Drawing on an information-theoretic framework, we formalize safety as the divergence degree from anthropic value distributions. We theoretically demonstrate that isolated self-evolution induces statistical blind spots, leading to the irreversible degradation of the system's safety alignment.

To address these issues, we propose ATTNPO, a low-overhead process-supervised RL framework that leverages the model's intrinsic attention signals for step-level credit assignment. We first identify a set of special attention heads that naturally focus on essential steps while suppressing redundant ones. By leveraging the attention scores of these heads, We then employ two sub-strategies to mitigate overthinking by discouraging redundant steps while preserving accuracy by reducing penalties on essential steps. Experimental results show that ATTNPO substantially reduces reasoning length while significantly improving performance across 9 benchmarks."}

In this paper, we introduce a novel Vietnamese dataset designed to train and evaluate MCRC models with explanation generation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose ViMultiChoice, a new method specifically designed for modeling Vietnamese reading comprehension that jointly predicts the correct answer and generates a corresponding explanation. Experimental results demonstrate that ViMultiChoice outperforms existing MCRC baselines, achieving state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on both the ViMMRC 2.0 benchmark and the newly introduced dataset. Additionally, we show that jointly training option decision and explanation generation leads to significant improvements in multiple-choice accuracy."}

According to the Poverty of the Stimulus Hypothesis (PoSH), the linguistic input children receive is insufficient to explain certain generalizations that are robustly learned; innate linguistic constraints, many have argued, are thus necessary to explain language learning. Neural language models, which lack such language-specific constraints in their design, offer a computational test of this longstanding (but controversial) claim. We introduce \\poshbench, a training-and-evaluation suite targeting question formation, islands to movement, and other English phenomena at the center of the PoSH arguments. Training Transformer models on 10--50M words of developmentally plausible text, we find indications of generalization on all phenomena even without direct positive evidence -- yet neural models remain less data-efficient and their generalizations are weaker than those of children. We further enhance our models with three recently proposed cognitively motivated inductive biases. We find these biases improve general syntactic competence but not \\poshbench performance. Our findings challenge the claim that innate syntax is the only possible route to generalization, while suggesting that human-like data efficiency requires inductive biases beyond those tested here."}

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Vietnamese ASR framework that explicitly models phonemic representations. Experiments on two publicly available Vietnamese ASR datasets show that ViSpeechFormer achieves strong performance, generalizes better to out-of-vocabulary words, and is less affected by training bias. This phoneme-based paradigm is also promising for other languages with phonetic orthographies. The code will be released upon acceptance of this paper."}

However, existing evaluation frameworks for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and open-ended question answering primarily rely on surface-level similarity, factual consistency, or semantic relevance, and often fail to assess whether responses provide the specific information required for domain-sensitive decisions. To address this gap, we propose a multi-dimensional, reference-free evaluation framework that assesses LLM outputs along four complementary dimensions: specificity, robustness to paraphrasing and semantic perturbations, answer relevance, and context utilization. We introduce a curated dataset of 1,412 domain-specific question-answer pairs spanning 40 professional roles and seven natural hazard types to support systematic evaluation. We further conduct human evaluation to assess inter-annotator agreement and alignment between model outputs and human judgments, which highlights the inherent subjectivity of open-ended, domain-specific evaluation. Our results show that no single metric sufficiently captures answer quality in isolation and demonstrate the need for structured, multi-metric evaluation frameworks when deploying LLMs in high-stakes applications."}

Existing solutions, ranging from non-parametric Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to parametric knowledge editing, are often constrained in practice by finite context windows, retriever noise, or the risk of catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose DRIFT, a novel dual-model architecture designed to explicitly decouple knowledge extraction from the reasoning process. Unlike static prompt compression, DRIFT employs a lightweight knowledge model to dynamically compress document chunks into implicit fact tokens conditioned on the query. These dense representations are projected into the reasoning model's embedding space, replacing raw, redundant text while maintaining inference accuracy. Extensive experiments show that DRIFT significantly improves performance on long-context tasks, outperforming strong baselines among comparably sized models. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient paradigm for extending the effective context window and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lancelot-Xie/DRIFT."}

In addition, to make the reasoning process transparent, a textual explanation is necessary to justify the verification result. However, most claim verification works mainly focus on the reasoning over textual evidence only or ignore the explainability, resulting in inaccurate and unconvincing verification. To address this problem, we propose a novel model that jointly achieves evidence retrieval, multi-modal claim verification, and explanation generation. For evidence retrieval, we construct a two-layer multi-modal graph for claims and evidence, where we design image-to-text and text-to-image reasoning for multi-modal retrieval. For claim verification, we propose token- and evidence-level fusion to integrate claim and evidence embeddings for multi-modal verification. For explanation generation, we introduce multi-modal Fusion-in-Decoder for explainability. Finally, since almost all the datasets are in general domain, we create a scientific dataset, AIChartClaim, in AI domain to complement claim verification community. Experiments show the strength of our model."}

Comprehensive evaluation across 170 subdomains demonstrates that Anagent achieves substantial improvements, up to $\\uparrow 13.43\\%$ in training-free settings and $\\uparrow 42.12\\%$ with finetuning, while revealing that task-oriented reasoning and context-aware problem-solving are essential for high-quality scientific table \\& figure analysis.

Our benchmark comprises 1,000 expert-written questions, 1,000 questions extracted from research papers using LLMs and validated by experts, plus an additional 700 questions including 350 open-ended questions and 350 questions with false premises to test whether models can correct erroneous assumptions. Human participants scored between 23% and 86%, with experts averaging 74%. Top-performing models exceeded the expert average, with Claude Opus 4.5 reaching 84% accuracy, though top models showed an average 12-point accuracy drop on expert-written questions compared to LLM-generated ones. Performance declined further on advanced topics, dropping to 73% on security questions. Additionally, models frequently accepted and reinforced false premises embedded in questions instead of identifying them, with accuracy below 66% on these critical reasoning tasks."}
