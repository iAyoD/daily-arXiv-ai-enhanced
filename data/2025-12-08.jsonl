In this study, we developed a chatbot for the University of Limerick's Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering to provide course information to students. A custom dataset of 1,203 question-answer pairs in SQuAD format was constructed using the university book of modules, supplemented with manually and synthetically generated entries. We fine-tuned BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) using PyTorch and evaluated performance with Exact Match and F1 scores. Results show that even modest fine-tuning improves hypothesis framing and knowledge extraction, demonstrating the feasibility of adapting foundation models to educational domains. While domain-specific BERT variants such as BioBERT and SciBERT exist for biomedical and scientific literature, no foundation model has yet been tailored to university course materials. Our work addresses this gap by showing that fine-tuning BERT with academic QA pairs yields effective results, highlighting the potential to scale towards the first domain-specific QA model for universities and enabling autonomous educational knowledge systems."}

Clinical notes for patients' assessments, diagnoses, and treatments are captured in these EHRs in free-form text by physicians, who spend a considerable amount of time entering and editing them. Manually writing clinical notes takes a considerable amount of a doctor's valuable time, increasing the patient's waiting time and possibly delaying diagnoses. Large language models (LLMs) possess the ability to generate news articles that closely resemble human-written ones. We investigate the usage of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt engineering to improve the LLM's response in clinical note generation. In our prompts, we use as input International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and basic patient information. We investigate a strategy that combines the traditional CoT with semantic search results to improve the quality of generated clinical notes. Additionally, we infuse a knowledge graph (KG) built from clinical ontology to further enrich the domain-specific knowledge of generated clinical notes.

Integrated into a novel robotic system, Aerially Transforming Morphobot (ATMO), internal deflectors intercept and redirect rotor wake downward, passively steering airflow momentum that would otherwise be wasted. This electronics-free solution achieves up to a 40% recovery of vertical thrust in configurations where no useful thrust would otherwise be produced, substantially extending hover and maneuvering capabilities during transformation. Our findings highlight a new direction for morphing aerial robot design, where passive aerodynamic structures, inspired by thrust vectoring in rockets and aircraft, enable efficient, agile flight without added mechanical complexity."}

Although CoT examples facilitate reasoning, we noticed that their excessive inclusion during meta-training degrades performance when CoT supervision is limited. To mitigate such behavior, we propose CoT-Recipe, a formal approach to modulate the mix of CoT and non-CoT examples in meta-training sequences. We demonstrate that careful modulation via CoT-Recipe can increase the accuracy of transformers on novel tasks by up to 300% even when there are no CoT examples available in-context.

The underlying challenge is that the optimization formulation becomes brittle and numerically unstable with changing scales, especially under potentially nonlinear constraints that impose dynamic restrictions, due to the kernel-based formulation. This paper proposes to address this problem via the development of a scale-agnostic and adaptive ergodic coverage optimization method based on the maximum mean discrepancy metric (MMD). Our approach allows the optimizer to solve for the scale of differential constraints while annealing the hyperparameters to best suit the problem domain and ensure physical consistency. We also derive a variation of the ergodic metric in the log space, providing additional numerical conditioning without loss of performance. We compare our approach with existing coverage planning methods and demonstrate the utility of our approach on a wide range of coverage problems."}

This wastes inference-time compute and can hurt accuracy. Existing attempts to stop early either manipulate decoding with extra sampling and heuristics, rely on auxiliary verifier models, or operate only as post-hoc analysis pipelines without formal guarantees. We introduce LYNX, an online early-exit mechanism that turns a model's own hidden-state awareness into confidence-controlled stopping decisions. LYNX attaches exit decisions to naturally occurring reasoning cues (e.g., \"hmm\", \"wait\") during generation, trains a lightweight probe on hidden states at those cue tokens using supervision from forced exits, and wraps the resulting scores in split conformal prediction to obtain distribution-free control over premature exits. Crucially, we train and calibrate this probe once on a generic mathematical corpus and reuse it unchanged across benchmarks, decoding temperatures, and even non-mathematical tasks. Across three model families spanning 1.5B to 32B parameters, a single mathematically trained probe per base model yields strong accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On GSM8K, LYNX matches or improves baseline accuracy while reducing tokens by 40--65\\%; on MATH-500 it improves accuracy by up to 12 points with roughly 35--60\\% fewer tokens; on AIME 2024 it recovers baseline accuracy with more than 50\\% token savings; and on CommonsenseQA, a non-math benchmark, it transfers zero-shot with modest accuracy gains and up to 70\\% fewer tokens. Compared to state-of-the-art early-exit methods, LYNX offers competitive or superior Pareto frontiers while remaining fully online, requiring no proxy models at inference, and providing explicit, user-tunable confidence guarantees."}

Despite recent advancements, many large-scale robotic policies still remain sensitive to key sources of observational variation such as changes in camera perspective, lighting, and the presence of distractor objects. We posit that the limited generalizability of these models arises from the substantial diversity required to robustly cover these quasistatic axes, coupled with the current scarcity of large-scale robotic datasets that exhibit rich variation across them. In this work, we propose to systematically examine what robots need to generalize across these challenging axes by introducing two key auxiliary tasks, state similarity and invariance to observational perturbations, applied to both demonstration data and static visual data. We then show that via these auxiliary tasks, leveraging both more-expensive robotic demonstration data and less-expensive, visually rich synthetic images generated from non-physics-based simulation (for example, Unreal Engine) can lead to substantial increases in generalization to unseen camera viewpoints, lighting configurations, and distractor conditions. Our results demonstrate that co-training on this diverse data improves performance by 18 percent over existing generative augmentation methods.

This paper presents XR-DT, an eXtended Reality-enhanced Digital Twin framework for agentic mobile robots, that bridges physical and virtual spaces to enable bi-directional understanding between humans and robots. Our hierarchical XR-DT architecture integrates virtual-, augmented-, and mixed-reality layers, fusing real-time sensor data, simulated environments in the Unity game engine, and human feedback captured through wearable AR devices. Within this framework, we design an agentic mobile robot system with a unified diffusion policy for context-aware task adaptation. We further propose a chain-of-thought prompting mechanism that allows multimodal large language models to reason over human instructions and environmental context, while leveraging an AutoGen-based multi-agent coordination layer to enhance robustness and collaboration in dynamic tasks. Initial experimental results demonstrate accurate human and robot trajectory prediction, validating the XR-DT framework's effectiveness in HRI tasks.

We challenge the naive assumption that linguistic change is simplification by quantitatively analyzing over 2,000 years of Sanskrit, demonstrating how weakly-supervised hybrid methods can yield new insights into the evolution of morphologically rich, low-resource languages. Our approach addresses data scarcity through weak supervision, using 100+ high-precision regex patterns to generate pseudo-labels for fine-tuning a multilingual BERT. We then fuse symbolic and neural outputs via a novel confidence-weighted ensemble, creating a system that is both scalable and interpretable. Applying this framework to a 1.47-million-word diachronic corpus, our ensemble achieves a 52.4% overall feature detection rate. Our findings reveal that Sanskrit's overall morphological complexity does not decrease but is instead dynamically redistributed: while earlier verbal features show cyclical patterns of decline, complexity shifts to other domains, evidenced by a dramatic expansion in compounding and the emergence of new philosophical terminology. Critically, our system produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, with confidence strongly correlating with accuracy (Pearson r = 0.92) and low overall calibration error (ECE = 0.043), bolstering the reliability of these findings for computational philology."}

This is particularly beneficial when 1) the inner-loop controller is imperfect, unmodifiable, and uncertain; and 2) the dynamic model exhibits significant uncertainty. Stability analysis, formal safety guarantee proof, and hardware experiments with a PUMA robotic manipulator are presented.

Despite many advantages, LM judges display concerning biases that can impair their integrity in evaluations. One such bias is self-preference: LM judges preferring their own answers over those produced by other LMs or humans. The bias is hard to eliminate as frontier LM judges can distinguish their own outputs from those of others, even when the evaluation candidates are not labeled with their sources. In this paper, we investigate strategies to mitigate self-preference by reducing the LM judges' ability to recognize their own outputs. We apply black-box perturbations to evaluation candidates in pairwise comparison to obfuscate the authorship and reduce self-recognition. We find that perturbations as simple as synonym replacement for a few words predictably reduce self-preference. However, we also uncover fundamental challenges to eliminating the bias: when we extrapolate our perturbations to a more complete neutralization of stylistic differences between the evaluation candidates, self-preference recovers. Our findings suggest that self-recognition and self-preference can happen on many semantic levels, and complete mitigation remains challenging despite promising initial results."}

However, these approaches either require additional test-time compute or assume access to more powerful teacher models, making them costly and less practical. In this work, we propose Self Critique and Refinement-based Preference Optimization (SCRPO), which is a self-supervised training framework that first constructs a preference dataset by leveraging the LLM's own critique and refinement capabilities, and then applies preference learning to improve the same LLM for faithful summarization. Experiments on three summarization benchmarks (XSUM CNNDM and SAMSum), demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods in terms of faithfulness metrics while either maintaining or improving other metrics that measure the overall quality of the summary.

To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose the Sparse-Quantized Format (SQ-format), which is a unified data format for quantization and sparsification potentially easily supported by new hardware and existing GPUs. SQ-format makes use of the fact that sparse matrix can be accelerated in high-precision, and low-precision matrix multiplication can also be accelerated accordingly. As such, SQ-format is proposed to achieve Pareto improvement between performance and throughput.

Experiments show that RAG markedly improves factual accuracy; open-source models gain up to +56.8 percentage points (for example, Qwen3 8B improves from 35.0 to 91.8), approaching proprietary model performance. RAG-style fine-tuning further boosts both factual recall and contextual reasoning, improving results on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. MusWikiDB also yields approximately 6 percentage points higher accuracy and 40% faster retrieval than a general-purpose Wikipedia corpus. We release MusWikiDB and ArtistMus to advance research in music information retrieval and domain-specific question answering, establishing a foundation for retrieval-augmented reasoning in culturally rich domains such as music."}

While AI-feedback-based self-improving alignment methods have been explored as a scalable alternative, they have largely remained constrained to conventional alignment values. In this work, we explore both a more holistic alignment objective and a scalable, self-improving alignment approach. Aiming to transcend conventional alignment norms, we introduce Collective Agency (CA)-a unified and open-ended alignment value that encourages integrated agentic capabilities. We also propose Dynamic Alignment-an alignment framework that enables an LLM to iteratively align itself. Dynamic Alignment comprises two key components: (1) automated training dataset generation with LLMs, and (2) a self-rewarding mechanism, where the policy model evaluates its own output candidates and assigns rewards for GRPO-based learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully aligns the model to CA while preserving general NLP capabilities."}

Numerous systems have been proposed for battery detection and removal from WEEE recycling lines, including X-ray and RGB-based visual inspection methods, typically driven by AI-powered object detection models (e.g., Mask R-CNN, YOLO, ResNets). Despite advances in optimizing detection techniques and model modifications, a fully autonomous solution capable of accurately identifying and sorting batteries across diverse WEEEs types has yet to be realized. In response to these challenges, we present our novel approach which integrates a specialized X-ray transmission dual energy imaging subsystem with advanced pre-processing algorithms, enabling high-contrast image reconstruction for effective differentiation of dense and thin materials in WEEE. Devices move along a conveyor belt through a high-resolution X-ray imaging system, where YOLO and U-Net models precisely detect and segment battery-containing items. An intelligent tracking and position estimation algorithm then guides a Delta robot equipped with a suction gripper to selectively extract and properly discard the targeted devices.

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel scenario-aware uncertainty quantification framework to provide the predicted trajectories with prediction intervals and reliability assessment. To begin with, predicted trajectories from the trained predictor and their ground truth are projected onto the map-derived reference routes within the Frenet coordinate system. We then employ CopulaCPTS as the conformal calibration method to generate temporal prediction intervals for distinct scenarios as the uncertainty measure. Building upon this, within the proposed trajectory reliability discriminator (TRD), mean error and calibrated confidence intervals are synergistically analyzed to establish reliability models for different scenarios. Subsequently, the risk-aware discriminator leverages a joint risk model that integrates longitudinal and lateral prediction intervals within the Frenet coordinate to identify critical points. This enables segmentation of trajectories into reliable and unreliable segments, holding the advantage of informing downstream planning modules with actionable reliability results. We evaluated our framework using the real-world nuPlan dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in scenario-aware uncertainty quantification and reliability assessment across diverse driving contexts."}

We compared three supervised transformer-based encoders (BioClinicalModernBERT, ModernBERT, Clinical Longformer) against four generative LLM configurations (Llama 3.1-8B, GPT-4o, GPT-OSS-20b). We introduced a novel inference strategy using lesion-tagged inputs and anatomy-aware prompting to ground model reasoning. Performance was evaluated using class-specific F1-scores.\n  Results: The anatomy-informed GPT-OSS-20b model achieved the highest performance, yielding an incidentaloma-positive macro-F1 of 0.79. This surpassed all supervised baselines (maximum macro-F1: 0.70) and closely matched the inter-annotator agreement of 0.76. Explicit anatomical grounding yielded statistically significant performance gains across GPT-based models (p < 0.05), while a majority-vote ensemble of the top systems further improved the macro-F1 to 0.90. Error analysis revealed that anatomy-aware LLMs demonstrated superior contextual reasoning in distinguishing actionable findings from benign lesions.\n  Conclusion: Generative LLMs, when enhanced with structured lesion tagging and anatomical context, significantly outperform traditional supervised encoders and achieve performance comparable to human experts.

Recent approaches have sought to address this challenge by training on large collections of heterogeneous robotic datasets. However, unlike vision or language data, robotic demonstrations exhibit substantial heterogeneity across embodiments and action spaces as well as other prominent variations such as senor configurations and action control frequencies. The lack of explicit designs for handling such heterogeneity causes existing methods to struggle with integrating diverse factors, thereby limiting their generalization and leading to degraded performance when transferred to new settings. In this paper, we present HiMoE-VLA, a novel vision-language-action (VLA) framework tailored to effectively handle diverse robotic data with heterogeneity. Specifically, we introduce a Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) architecture for the action module which adaptively handles multiple sources of heterogeneity across layers and gradually abstracts them into shared knowledge representations. Through extensive experimentation with simulation benchmarks and real-world robotic platforms, HiMoE-VLA demonstrates a consistent performance boost over existing VLA baselines, achieving higher accuracy and robust generalization across diverse robots and action spaces.

Owing to computational and token-cost constraints, we evaluate a curated set of 100 representative problems across multiple large language models (LLMs), including GPT-OSS and LLaMA variants, under standard prompting, CoT, and ToT strategies. Our results show that CoT improves baseline accuracy from 78% (standard prompting) to 83% on average, while ToT further increases performance by up to 5 percentage points, achieving 88% accuracy with GPT-OSS-120B. These improvements highlight that ToT is particularly effective in medium-to-large-scale models but may offer less advantage for smaller ones. Overall, our findings establish ToT as a robust framework for solving mathematical problems in low-resource languages such as Bengali. More broadly, this study shows that structured reasoning methods like ToT can provide more reliable and globally consistent outcomes than CoT, paving the way for better reasoning strategies in multilingual NLP."}

A significant challenge in robotic assistance lies in surgical path planning, which often relies on the registration of intraoperative 2D images with preoperative 3D CT scans. This requirement can be burdensome and costly, particularly in procedures like vertebroplasty, where preoperative CT scans are not routinely performed. To address this issue, we introduce a differentiable rendering-based framework for 3D transpedicular path planning utilizing bi-planar 2D X-rays. Our method integrates differentiable rendering with a vertebral atlas generated through a Statistical Shape Model (SSM) and employs a learned similarity loss to refine the SSM shape and pose dynamically, independent of fixed imaging geometries. We evaluated our framework in two stages: first, through vertebral reconstruction from orthogonal X-rays for benchmarking, and second, via clinician-in-the-loop path planning using arbitrary-view X-rays. Our results indicate that our method outperformed a normalized cross-correlation baseline in reconstruction metrics (DICE: 0.75 vs. 0.65) and achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model ReVerteR (DICE: 0.77), while maintaining generalization to arbitrary views. Success rates for bipedicular planning reached 82% with synthetic data and 75% with cadaver data, exceeding the 66% and 31% rates of a 2D-to-3D baseline, respectively. In conclusion, our framework facilitates versatile, CT-free 3D path planning for robot-assisted vertebroplasty, effectively accommodating real-world imaging diversity without the need for preoperative CT scans."}

We produce 500k traces in English, Italian, and Spanish, using a retrievalaugmented generation approach over medical information from Wikipedia. The traces are generated to solve medical questions drawn from MedQA and MedMCQA, which we extend to Italian and Spanish.

Safe sets are computed by optimizing Lyapunov functions through an original iterative Sum-of-Squares (SOS) procedure. The method is first demonstrated on a two-state benchmark, where it accurately recovers a prescribed safe region as the 1-level set of a polynomial Lyapunov function. We then describe the distinguishing characteristics of the studied vehicle-with-driver system: the control dynamics mimic human driver behavior through a delayed preview-tracking model that, with suitable parameter choices, can also emulate digital controllers. To enable SOS optimization, a polynomial approximation of the nonlinear vehicle model is derived, together with its operating-envelope constraints. The framework is then applied to understeering and oversteering scenarios, and the estimated safe sets are compared with reference boundaries obtained from exhaustive simulations. The results show that SOS techniques can efficiently deliver Lyapunov-defined safe regions, supporting their potential use for real-time safety assessment, for example as a supervisory layer for active vehicle control."}

We introduce Interleaved Latent Visual Reasoning (ILVR), a framework that unifies dynamic state evolution with precise perceptual modeling. ILVR interleaves textual generation with latent visual representations that act as specific, evolving cues for subsequent reasoning. To enable this, we employ a self-supervision strategy where a Momentum Teacher Model selectively distills relevant features from helper images into sparse supervision targets. This adaptive selection mechanism guides the model to autonomously generate context-aware visual signals. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ILVR significantly outperforms existing approaches, effectively bridging the gap between fine-grained perception and sequential multimodal reasoning."}

The model uses physically based rendering (PBR) in the near-infrared domain. It assumes single-bounce reflections and retroreflections over rasterized rendered images from shading or ray tracing, including light emitted from the sensor as well as stray light from other, non-correlated sources such as sunlight. Beams from the sensor and sensitivity of the receiving diodes are modeled with flexible beam steering patterns and with non-vanishing diameter.\n  Different (all non-real time) computational approaches can be chosen based on system properties, computing capabilities, and desired output properties.\n  Model parameters include system-specific properties, namely the physical spread of the LiDAR beam, combined with the sensitivity of the receiving diode; the intensity of the emitted light; the conversion between the intensity of reflected light and the echo pulse width; and scenario parameters such as environment lighting, positioning, and surface properties of the target(s) in the relevant infrared domain. System-specific properties of the model are determined from laboratory measurements of the photometric luminance on different target surfaces aligned with a goniometer at 0.01° resolution, which marks the best available resolution for measuring the beam pattern.\n  The approach is calibrated for and tested on two automotive LiDAR systems, the Valeo Scala Gen. 2 and the Blickfeld Cube 1. Both systems differ notably in their properties and available interfaces, but the relevant model parameters could be extracted successfully."}

Conformal In-Context Learning (CICLe) has been proposed as a resource-efficient framework that integrates a lightweight base classifier with Conformal Prediction to guide LLM prompting by adaptively reducing the set of candidate classes. However, its broader applicability and efficiency benefits beyond a single domain have not yet been systematically explored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of CICLe across diverse NLP classification benchmarks. The results show that CICLe consistently improves over its base classifier and outperforms few-shot prompting baselines when the sample size is sufficient for training the base classifier, and performs comparably in low-data regimes. In terms of efficiency, CICLe reduces the number of shots and prompt length by up to 34.45% and 25.16%, respectively, and enables the use of smaller models with competitive performance. CICLe is furthermore particularly advantageous for text classification tasks with high class imbalance. These findings highlight CICLe as a practical and scalable approach for efficient text classification, combining the robustness of traditional classifiers with the adaptability of LLMs, and achieving substantial gains in data and computational efficiency."}

At the core of our approach, each task is defined by the intended motion of keypoints selected on objects in the scene. Instead of assuming a fixed number of keypoints or uniformly spaced time intervals, COIL supports task specifications with variable spatial and temporal granularity, adapting to different user intents and task requirements. To robustly ground this correspondence-oriented task representation into actions, we design a conditional policy with a spatio-temporal attention mechanism that effectively fuses information across multiple input modalities. The policy is trained via a scalable self-supervised pipeline using demonstrations collected in simulation, with correspondence labels automatically generated in hindsight. COIL generalizes across tasks, objects, and motion patterns, achieving superior performance compared to prior methods on real-world manipulation tasks under both sparse and dense specifications."}

Existing methods often rely on shallow cues (e.g., names or topics) to simulate authorial style, without robust evaluation. In this work, we present a training framework for style-conditioned story generation using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a custom multi-reward setup. The style reward is derived from a fine-tuned sentence transformer using authorship verification (AV) signals, combined with content and completeness scores to stabilize long-form narrative generation. We conduct experiments using fiction by Mark Twain, a prominent 19th-century American author, with The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn serving as the reference style exemplar. Our 8B model outperforms larger baselines such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 4 in AV-style metrics, achieving a style score of 0.628 and competitive content quality. Results demonstrate the feasibility of agentic stylistic generation with moderate model size and task-specific training. While the output is clearly style-aligned, narrative completeness remains a challenge, indicating future work is needed to better model global coherence and story resolution."}

However, they lack a grounded understanding of physical dynamics. This limitation arises from training VLMs on static internet-scale visual-language data that contain no causal interactions or action-conditioned changes. Consequently, it remains challenging to leverage VLMs for fine-grained robotic manipulation tasks that require physical understanding, reasoning, and corresponding action planning. To overcome this, we present SIMPACT, a test-time, SIMulation-enabled ACTion Planning framework that equips VLMs with physical reasoning through simulation-in-the-loop world modeling, without requiring any additional training. From a single RGB-D observation, SIMPACT efficiently constructs physics simulations, enabling the VLM to propose informed actions, observe simulated rollouts, and iteratively refine its reasoning. By integrating language reasoning with physics prediction, our simulation-enabled VLM can understand contact dynamics and action outcomes in a physically grounded way. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on five challenging, real-world rigid-body and deformable manipulation tasks that require fine-grained physical reasoning, outperforming existing general-purpose robotic manipulation models. Our results demonstrate that embedding physics understanding via efficient simulation into VLM reasoning at test time offers a promising path towards generalizable embodied intelligence.

Gender, Interruptions, and Emotional Tone in U.S. Supreme Court Oral Arguments", "comment": "12 pages, 5 figures, 1 table. Includes appendix. Code available at: https://github.com/1TSHARUKA/Emotional_Interruption_Analysis", "summary": "This study examines how interruptions during U.S. Supreme Court oral arguments shape both the semantic content and emotional tone of advocates' speech, with a focus on gendered dynamics in judicial discourse. Using the ConvoKit Supreme Court Corpus (2010-2019), we analyze 12,663 speech chunks from advocate-justice interactions to assess whether interruptions alter the meaning of an advocate's argument and whether interruptions toward female advocates exhibit more negative emotional valence. Semantic shifts are quantified using GloVe-based sentence embeddings, while sentiment is measured through lexicon-based analysis. We find that semantic similarity between pre- and post-interruption speech remains consistently high, suggesting that interruptions do not substantially alter argumentative content. However, interruptions directed at female advocates contain significantly higher levels of negative sentiment. These results deepen empirical understanding of gendered communication in elite institutional settings and demonstrate the value of computational linguistic methods for studying power, discourse, and equity in judicial proceedings."}

However, this inpainting method introduces computational overhead that increases inference latency. In this work, we propose a simple alternative: simulating inference delay at training time and conditioning on action prefixes directly, eliminating any inference-time overhead. Our method requires no modifications to the model architecture or robot runtime, and can be implemented with only a few additional lines of code. In simulated experiments, we find that training-time RTC outperforms inference-time RTC at higher inference delays. In real-world experiments on box building and espresso making tasks with the $π_{0.6}$ VLA, we demonstrate that training-time RTC maintains both task performance and speed parity with inference-time RTC while being computationally cheaper. Our results suggest that training-time action conditioning is a practical drop-in replacement for inference-time inpainting in real-time robot control."}

Here, we ask whether assigning personas to models improves performance on difficult objective multiple-choice questions. We study both domain-specific expert personas and low-knowledge personas, evaluating six models on GPQA Diamond (Rein et al. 2024) and MMLU-Pro (Wang et al. 2024), graduate-level questions spanning science, engineering, and law.\n  We tested three approaches:\n  -In-Domain Experts: Assigning the model an expert persona (\"you are a physics expert\") matched to the problem type (physics problems) had no significant impact on performance (with the exception of the Gemini 2.0 Flash model).\n  -Off-Domain Experts (Domain-Mismatched): Assigning the model an expert persona (\"you are a physics expert\") not matched to the problem type (law problems) resulted in marginal differences.\n  -Low-Knowledge Personas: We assigned the model negative capability personas (layperson, young child, toddler), which were generally harmful to benchmark accuracy.\n  Across both benchmarks, persona prompts generally did not improve accuracy relative to a no-persona baseline. Expert personas showed no consistent benefit across models, with few exceptions. Domain-mismatched expert personas sometimes degraded performance. Low-knowledge personas often reduced accuracy. These results are about the accuracy of answers only; personas may serve other purposes (such as altering the tone of outputs), beyond improving factual performance."}

In this paper, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based medical QA system that combines domain-specific knowledge retrieval with open-source LLMs to answer medical questions. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art open LLMs (LLaMA~2 and Falcon) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient domain specialization. The system retrieves relevant medical literature to ground the LLM's answers, thereby improving factual correctness and reducing hallucinations. We evaluate the approach on benchmark datasets (PubMedQA and MedMCQA) and show that retrieval augmentation yields measurable improvements in answer accuracy compared to using LLMs alone. Our fine-tuned LLaMA~2 model achieves 71.8% accuracy on PubMedQA, substantially improving over the 55.4% zero-shot baseline, while maintaining transparency by providing source references. We also detail the system design and fine-tuning methodology, demonstrating that grounding answers in retrieved evidence reduces unsupported content by approximately 60%. These results highlight the potential of RAG-augmented open-source LLMs for reliable biomedical QA, pointing toward practical clinical informatics applications."}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this limitation by enabling access to up-to-date, culturally grounded, and multilingual information; however, multilingual multimodal RAG remains largely underexplored. We introduce M4-RAG, a massive-scale benchmark covering 42 languages and 56 regional dialects and registers, comprising over 80,000 culturally diverse image-question pairs for evaluating retrieval-augmented VQA across languages and modalities. To balance realism with reproducibility, we build a controlled retrieval environment containing millions of carefully curated multilingual documents relevant to the query domains, approximating real-world retrieval conditions while ensuring consistent experimentation. Our systematic evaluation reveals that although RAG consistently benefits smaller VLMs, it fails to scale to larger models and often even degrades their performance, exposing a critical mismatch between model size and current retrieval effectiveness. M4-RAG provides a foundation for advancing next-generation RAG systems capable of reasoning seamlessly across languages, modalities, and cultural contexts."}
