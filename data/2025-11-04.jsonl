However, the existing\ndiffusion-based paradigm often struggles to capture strong temporal\ndependencies across multiple steps, particularly when incorporating\nproprioceptive input. This limitation can lead to task failures, where the\npolicy overfits to proprioceptive cues at the expense of capturing the visually\nderived features of the task. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Deep\nKoopman-boosted Dual-branch Diffusion Policy (D3P) algorithm. D3P introduces a\ndual-branch architecture to decouple the roles of different sensory modality\ncombinations. The visual branch encodes the visual observations to indicate\ntask progression, while the fused branch integrates both visual and\nproprioceptive inputs for precise manipulation. Within this architecture, when\nthe robot fails to accomplish intermediate goals, such as grasping a drawer\nhandle, the policy can dynamically switch to execute action chunks generated by\nthe visual branch, allowing recovery to previously observed states and\nfacilitating retrial of the task. To further enhance visual representation\nlearning, we incorporate a Deep Koopman Operator module that captures\nstructured temporal dynamics from visual inputs. During inference, we use the\ntest-time loss of the generative model as a confidence signal to guide the\naggregation of the temporally overlapping predicted action chunks, thereby\nenhancing the reliability of policy execution.

However,\npath planning for these robots in unknown environments presents a significant\nchallenge, requiring a delicate balance between efficient exploration and\nrobust planning. Traditional path planners, which treat the environment as a\ngeometric grid, often suffer from redundant searches and are prone to failure\nin complex scenarios due to their lack of semantic understanding. To overcome\nthese limitations, we reframe path planning in unknown environments as a\nsemantic reasoning task. We introduce a Semantic Agent for Tensegrity robots\n(SATPlanner) driven by a Large Language Model (LLM). SATPlanner leverages\nhigh-level environmental comprehension to generate efficient and reliable\nplanning strategies.At the core of SATPlanner is an Adaptive Observation Window\nmechanism, inspired by the \"fast\" and \"slow\" thinking paradigms of LLMs. This\nmechanism dynamically adjusts the perceptual field of the agent: it narrows for\nrapid traversal of open spaces and expands to reason about complex obstacle\nconfigurations. This allows the agent to construct a semantic belief of the\nenvironment, enabling the search space to grow only linearly with the path\nlength (O(L)) while maintaining path quality. We extensively evaluate\nSATPlanner in 1,000 simulation trials, where it achieves a 100% success rate,\noutperforming other real-time planning algorithms. Critically, SATPlanner\nreduces the search space by 37.2% compared to the A* algorithm while achieving\ncomparable, near-optimal path lengths.

This transformation from concave\nto convex is initiated by changes in turgor pressure and the release of stored\nelastic energy from prestresses in the concave state, which accelerate this\nmovement, leading to inversion of the lobes bi-axial curvature. Possessing two\nlow-energy states, the leaves can be characterized as bistable systems.

To address highly cluttered, non-monotone scenarios,\nwe propose a Selective Guided Forward Search (SGFS) that efficiently relocates\nonly critical obstacles and to feasible relocation points. Furthermore, we\nadopt a refinement method for adaptive subgoal selection to eliminate\nunnecessary pick-and-place actions, thereby improving overall solution quality.\nExtensive evaluations on nine benchmark rearrangement tasks demonstrate that\nMO-SeGMan generates feasible motion plans in all cases, consistently achieving\nfaster solution times and superior solution quality compared to the baselines.\nThese results highlight the robustness and scalability of the proposed\nframework for complex rearrangement planning problems."}

Although\nexisting methods have made significant progress, two challenges remain\nunresolved. First, the modality gap between egocentric RGB observations and the\nfloor plan hinders the integration of visual and spatial information for both\nlocal obstacle avoidance and global planning. Second, accurate localization is\ncritical for navigation performance, but remains challenging at deployment in\nunseen environments due to the lack of explicit geometric alignment between RGB\ninputs and floor plans. We propose a novel diffusion-based policy, denoted as\nGlocDiff, which integrates global path planning from the floor plan with local\ndepth-aware features derived from RGB observations. The floor plan offers\nexplicit global guidance, while the depth features provide implicit geometric\ncues, collectively enabling precise prediction of optimal navigation directions\nand robust obstacle avoidance. Moreover, GlocDiff introduces noise perturbation\nduring training to enhance robustness against pose estimation errors, and we\nfind that combining this with a relatively stable VO module during inference\nresults in significantly improved navigation performance. Extensive experiments\non the FloNa benchmark demonstrate GlocDiff's efficiency and effectiveness in\nachieving superior navigation performance, and the success of real-world\ndeployments also highlights its potential for widespread practical\napplications."}

A physics-based pose selector first\nidentifies feasible contact regions with optimal force distribution based on\nsurface geometry.

Recent work integrates future images into the\nunderstanding-acting loop, yielding unified VLAs that jointly understand,\ngenerate, and act -- reading text and images and producing future images and\nactions. However, these models either rely on external experts for modality\nunification or treat image generation and action prediction as separate\nprocesses, limiting the benefits of direct synergy between these tasks. Our\ncore philosophy is to optimize generation and action jointly through a\nsynchronous denoising process, where the iterative refinement enables actions\nto evolve from initialization, under constant and sufficient visual guidance.\nWe ground this philosophy in our proposed Unified Diffusion VLA and Joint\nDiscrete Denoising Diffusion Process (JD3P), which is a joint diffusion process\nthat integrates multiple modalities into a single denoising trajectory to serve\nas the key mechanism enabling understanding, generation, and acting to be\nintrinsically synergistic.

Traditional rigid robotic hands, with\nlimited degrees of freedom and compliance, rely on complex model-based and\nheavy feedback controllers to manage such interactions. Soft robots, by\ncontrast, exhibit embodied mechanical intelligence: their underactuated\nstructures and passive flexibility of their whole body, naturally accommodate\nuncertain contacts and enable adaptive behaviors. To harness this capability,\nwe propose a lightweight actuation-space learning framework that infers\ndistributional control representations for whole-body soft robotic grasping,\ndirectly from deterministic demonstrations using a flow matching model\n(Rectified Flow),without requiring dense sensing or heavy control loops. Using\nonly 30 demonstrations (less than 8% of the reachable workspace), the learned\npolicy achieves a 97.5% grasp success rate across the whole workspace,\ngeneralizes to grasped-object size variations of +-33%, and maintains stable\nperformance when the robot's dynamic response is directly adjusted by scaling\nthe execution time from 20% to 200%. These results demonstrate that\nactuation-space learning, by leveraging its passive redundant DOFs and\nflexibility, converts the body's mechanics into functional control intelligence\nand substantially reduces the burden on central controllers for this\nuncertain-rich task."}
