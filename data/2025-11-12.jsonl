However, to unlock such multimodal potential, robots need to learn the correlations between an object's visual appearance and the sound it generates when they interact with it. Such an active sensorimotor experience requires new interaction capabilities, representations, and exploration methods to guide the robot in efficiently building increasingly rich audiovisual knowledge. In this work, we present CAVER, a novel robot that builds and utilizes rich audiovisual representations of objects. CAVER includes three novel contributions: 1) a novel 3D printed end-effector, attachable to parallel grippers, that excites objects' audio responses, 2) an audiovisual representation that combines local and global appearance information with sound features, and 3) an exploration algorithm that uses and builds the audiovisual representation in a curiosity-driven manner that prioritizes interacting with high uncertainty objects to obtain good coverage of surprising audio with fewer interactions. We demonstrate that CAVER builds rich representations in different scenarios more efficiently than several exploration baselines, and that the learned audiovisual representation leads to significant improvements in material classification and the imitation of audio-only human demonstrations. https://caver-bot.github.io/"}

Yet most robot learning algorithms remain blind to time. We introduce time-aware policy learning, a reinforcement learning framework that enables robots to explicitly perceive and reason with time as a first-class variable. The framework augments conventional reinforcement policies with two complementary temporal signals, the remaining time and a time ratio, which allow a single policy to modulate its behavior continuously from rapid and dynamic to cautious and precise execution. By jointly optimizing punctuality and stability, the robot learns to balance efficiency, robustness, resiliency, and punctuality without re-training or reward adjustment. Across diverse manipulation domains from long-horizon pick and place, to granular-media pouring, articulated-object handling, and multi-agent object delivery, the time-aware policy produces adaptive behaviors that outperform standard reinforcement learning baselines by up to 48% in efficiency, 8 times more robust in sim-to-real transfer, and 90% in acoustic quietness while maintaining near-perfect success rates. Explicit temporal reasoning further enables real-time human-in-the-loop control and multi-agent coordination, allowing robots to recover from disturbances, re-synchronize after delays, and align motion tempo with human intent. By treating time not as a constraint but as a controllable dimension of behavior, time-aware policy learning provides a unified foundation for efficient, robust, resilient, and human-aligned robot autonomy."}

We demonstrate the utility of the recently released HoloOcean 2.0 simulator with improved dynamics for torpedo AUV vehicles and a new ROS 2 interface. We have successfully demonstrated a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) and Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) setup for testing and evaluating a CougUV torpedo autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that was built and developed in our lab.

Existing methods typically build networks on top of 2D visual backbones and depend heavily on labeled data for training, which is often scarce in real-world scenarios, causing a sim-to-real gap. Moreover, these approaches reduce the 3D-based problem to 2D domain, neglecting the 3D priors. To address these, we propose Robot Topological Alignment Graph (RoboTAG), which incorporates a 3D branch to inject 3D priors while enabling co-evolution of the 2D and 3D representations, alleviating the reliance on labels. Specifically, the RoboTAG consists of a 3D branch and a 2D branch, where nodes represent the states of the camera and robot system, and edges capture the dependencies between these variables or denote alignments between them. Closed loops are then defined in the graph, on which a consistency supervision across branches can be applied. This design allows us to utilize in-the-wild images as training data without annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is effective across robot types, highlighting its potential to alleviate the data bottleneck in robotics."}

Aimed at achieving a similar level of capability in large language models (LLMs) for embodied intelligence, data quality plays a crucial role in training a foundational model with diverse robot skills. In this study, we investigate the collection of data for manipulation tasks using teleoperation devices. Different devices yield varying effects when paired with corresponding controller strategies, including position-based inverse kinematics (IK) control, torque-based inverse dynamics (ID) control, and optimization-based compliance control. In this paper, we develop a teleoperation pipeline that is compatible with different teleoperation devices and manipulator controllers. Within the pipeline, we construct the optimal QP formulation with the dynamic nullspace and the impedance tracking as the novel optimal controller to achieve compliant pose tracking and singularity avoidance. Regarding the optimal controller, it adaptively adjusts the weights assignment depending on the robot joint manipulability that reflects the state of joint configuration for the pose tracking in the form of impedance control and singularity avoidance with nullspace tracking. Analysis of quantitative experimental results suggests the quality of the teleoperated trajectory data, including tracking error, occurrence of singularity, and the smoothness of the joints' trajectory, with different combinations of teleoperation interface and the motion controller."}

Task and motion planning (TAMP) methods interleave the two processes of task planning and motion planning to ensure goal achievement and motion feasibility. Within the TAMP context, we are concerned with the mobile manipulation (MoMa) of multiple objects, where it is necessary to interleave actions for navigation and manipulation.\n  In particular, we aim to compute where and how each object should be placed given underspecified goals, such as ``set up dinner table with a fork, knife and plate.'' We leverage the rich common sense knowledge from large language models (LLMs), e.g., about how tableware is organized, to facilitate both task-level and motion-level planning. In addition, we use computer vision methods to learn a strategy for selecting base positions to facilitate MoMa behaviors, where the base position corresponds to the robot's ``footprint'' and orientation in its operating space. Altogether, this article provides a principled TAMP framework for MoMa tasks that accounts for common sense about object rearrangement and is adaptive to novel situations that include many objects that need to be moved. We performed quantitative experiments in both real-world settings and simulated environments. We evaluated the success rate and efficiency in completing long-horizon object rearrangement tasks. While the robot completed 84.4\\% real-world object rearrangement trials, subjective human evaluations indicated that the robot's performance is still lower than experienced human waiters."}

We present Video Prediction for Robot Actions (ViPRA), a simple pretraining-finetuning framework that learns continuous robot control from these actionless videos. Instead of directly predicting actions, we train a video-language model to predict both future visual observations and motion-centric latent actions, which serve as intermediate representations of scene dynamics. We train these latent actions using perceptual losses and optical flow consistency to ensure they reflect physically grounded behavior. For downstream control, we introduce a chunked flow matching decoder that maps latent actions to robot-specific continuous action sequences, using only 100 to 200 teleoperated demonstrations. This approach avoids expensive action annotation, supports generalization across embodiments, and enables smooth, high-frequency continuous control upto 22 Hz via chunked action decoding. Unlike prior latent action works that treat pretraining as autoregressive policy learning, explicitly models both what changes and how. Our method outperforms strong baselines, with a 16% gain on the SIMPLER benchmark and a 13% improvement across real world manipulation tasks.

These methods often compare only against hand-crafted heuristics, dismissing model-based approaches as impractical given the system complexity and uncertain wind forecasts. We revisit this assumption about the efficacy of model-based control for station-keeping by developing First-Order Model Predictive Control (FOMPC). By implementing the wind and balloon dynamics as differentiable functions in JAX, we enable gradient-based trajectory optimization for online planning. FOMPC outperforms a state-of-the-art RL policy, achieving a 24% improvement in time-within-radius (TWR) without requiring offline training, though at the cost of greater online computation per control step. Through systematic ablations of modeling assumptions and control factors, we show that online planning is effective across many configurations, including under simplified wind and dynamics models."}

We propose that polyurethane rubber, used for high-load applications like shoe soles, rubber wheels, and industrial gaskets, may provide improved physical gel resilience, potentially at the cost of sensitivity. To compare the resilience and sensitivity of silicone and polyurethane VBTS gels, we propose a series of standard evaluation benchmarking protocols. Our resilience tests assess sensor durability across normal loading, shear loading, and abrasion. For sensitivity, we introduce model-free assessments of force and spatial sensitivity to directly measure the physical capabilities of each gel without effects introduced from data and model quality.

Unlike traditional centralized planning methods, our system does not dictate robot paths but instead provides stop commands, functioning as a virtual traffic light. In simulation experiments with multiple robots, our approach increased the success rate of robots reaching their goals while reducing deadlocks.

Current neural controllers for humanoids remain modest in size, target a limited behavior set, and are trained on a handful of GPUs over several days. We show that scaling up model capacity, data, and compute yields a generalist humanoid controller capable of creating natural and robust whole-body movements. Specifically, we posit motion tracking as a natural and scalable task for humanoid control, leverageing dense supervision from diverse motion-capture data to acquire human motion priors without manual reward engineering. We build a foundation model for motion tracking by scaling along three axes: network size (from 1.2M to 42M parameters), dataset volume (over 100M frames, 700 hours of high-quality motion data), and compute (9k GPU hours). Beyond demonstrating the benefits of scale, we show the practical utility of our model through two mechanisms: (1) a real-time universal kinematic planner that bridges motion tracking to downstream task execution, enabling natural and interactive control, and (2) a unified token space that supports various motion input interfaces, such as VR teleoperation devices, human videos, and vision-language-action (VLA) models, all using the same policy. Scaling motion tracking exhibits favorable properties: performance improves steadily with increased compute and data diversity, and learned representations generalize to unseen motions, establishing motion tracking at scale as a practical foundation for humanoid control."}

A search strategy is proposed that exploits a probabilistic visibility volume (VV) to plan its future motion with iterative deepening $A^\\ast$. The probabilistic VV is a time-varying three-dimensional representation of the sensing constraints for a particular distribution of the POI's state. To find the path most likely to view the POI, the planner uses a heuristic to optimistically estimate the probability of viewing the POI over a time horizon. The probabilistic VV is max-pooled to create a variable-timestep planner that reduces the search space and balances long-term and short-term planning. The proposed path planning method is compared to prior work with a Monte-Carlo simulation and is shown to outperform the baseline methods in cluttered environments when the UAV's sensor has a higher false alarm probability."}

Model-based locomotion approaches typically adopt heuristic methods or planning based on the linear inverted pendulum model. These methods account for linear velocity in footstep planning, while excluding angular velocity, which leads to angular momentum being handled exclusively via ground reaction force (GRF). Footstep planning based on MPC that takes angular velocity into account recasts the angular momentum control problem as a dual-input approach that coordinates GRFs and footstep placement, instead of optimizing GRFs alone, thereby improving tracking performance. A mutual-feedback loop couples the footstep planner and the GRF MPC, with each using the other's solution to iteratively update footsteps and GRFs. The use of optimal solutions reduces body oscillation and enables extended stance and swing phases. The method is validated on a quadruped robot, demonstrating robust locomotion with reduced oscillations, longer stance and swing phases across various terrains."}

A global path has already been computed, and the robot is provided with waypoints along this path. As the UGV travels between these waypoints, the algorithm aims to avoid collisions with dynamic obstacles. These obstacles follow polynomial trajectories, with their initial positions randomized in the local map and velocities randomized between O and the allowable physical velocity limit of the robot, along with some random accelerations. The developed algorithm is tested in several scenarios where many dynamic obstacles move randomly in the environment.

Recent work has identified game theory, particularly the concept of Nash Equilibrium (NE), as a key enabler for behavior-aware decision-making. Yet, existing work falls short of fully unleashing the power of game-theoretic reasoning. Specifically, popular optimization-based methods require simplified robot dynamics and tend to get trapped in local minima due to convexification. Other works that rely on payoff matrices suffer from poor scalability due to the explicit enumeration of all possible trajectories. To bridge this gap, we introduce Game-Theoretic Nested Search (GTNS), a novel, scalable, and provably correct approach for computing NEs in general dynamical systems. GTNS efficiently searches the action space of all agents involved, while discarding trajectories that violate the NE constraint (no unilateral deviation) through an inner search over a lower-dimensional space.

While conventional numerical optimization methods can efficiently handle simple dynamics and cost structures, they often become intractable for the nonlinear or non-differentiable systems commonly encountered in robotics. This article provides a tutorial on probabilistic inference-based MPC, presenting a unified theoretical foundation and a comprehensive overview of representative methods. Probabilistic inference-based MPC approaches, such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control, have gained significant attention by reinterpreting optimal control as a problem of probabilistic inference. Rather than relying on gradient-based numerical optimization, these methods estimate optimal control distributions through sampling-based techniques, accommodating arbitrary cost functions and dynamics. We first derive the optimal control distribution from the standard optimal control problem, elucidating its probabilistic interpretation and key characteristics. The widely used MPPI algorithm is then derived as a practical example, followed by discussions on prior and variational distribution design, tuning principles, and theoretical aspects. This article aims to serve as a systematic guide for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand, implement, and extend these methods in robotics and beyond."}

However, effective multi-agent interaction necessitates robust perspective-taking capabilities, enabling models to interpret both physical and epistemic viewpoints. Current training paradigms often neglect these interactive contexts, resulting in challenges when models must reason about the subjectivity of individual perspectives or navigate environments with multiple observers. This study evaluates whether explicitly incorporating diverse points of view using the ReAct framework, an approach that integrates reasoning and acting, can enhance an LLM's ability to understand and ground the demands of other agents. We extend the classic Director task by introducing active visual exploration across a suite of seven scenarios of increasing perspective-taking complexity. These scenarios are designed to challenge the agent's capacity to resolve referential ambiguity based on visual access and interaction, under varying state representations and prompting strategies, including ReAct-style reasoning. Our results demonstrate that explicit perspective cues, combined with active exploration strategies, significantly improve the model's interpretative accuracy and collaborative effectiveness. These findings highlight the potential of integrating active perception with perspective-taking mechanisms in advancing LLMs' application in robotics and multi-agent systems, setting a foundation for future research into adaptive and context-aware AI systems."}

Despite their success in open-loop evaluations, these systems often exhibit significant performance degradation in closed-loop scenarios due to causal confusion. This confusion is fundamentally exacerbated by the overreliance of the imitation learning paradigm on expert trajectories, which often contain unattributable noise and interfere with the modeling of causal relationships between environmental contexts and appropriate driving actions.\n  To address this fundamental limitation, we propose Perception-Guided Self-Supervision (PGS) - a simple yet effective training paradigm that leverages perception outputs as the primary supervisory signals, explicitly modeling causal relationships in decision-making. The proposed framework aligns both the inputs and outputs of the decision-making module with perception results, such as lane centerlines and the predicted motions of surrounding agents, by introducing positive and negative self-supervision for the ego trajectory. This alignment is specifically designed to mitigate causal confusion arising from the inherent noise in expert trajectories.\n  Equipped with perception-driven supervision, our method, built on a standard end-to-end architecture, achieves a Driving Score of 78.08 and a mean success rate of 48.64% on the challenging closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods, including those employing more complex network architectures and inference pipelines. These results underscore the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed PGS framework and point to a promising direction for addressing causal confusion and enhancing real-world generalization in autonomous driving."}

With the ever-increasing incorporation of these data-driven models into the estimation domain, model predictions with reliable margins of error are a requirement -- especially for safety-critical applications. This paper discusses the application of a novel real-time, data-driven estimation approach based on the multi-fidelity residual physics-informed neural process (MFR-PINP) toward the real-time state estimation of a robotic system. Specifically, we address the model-mismatch issue of selecting an accurate kinematic model by tasking the MFR-PINP to also learn the residuals between simple, low-fidelity predictions and complex, high-fidelity ground-truth dynamics. To account for model uncertainty present in a physical implementation, robust uncertainty guarantees from the split conformal (SC) prediction framework are modeled in the training and inference paradigms. We provide implementation details of our MFR-PINP-based estimator for a hybrid online learning setting to validate our model's usage in real-time applications. Experimental results of our approach's performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art variants of the Kalman filter (i.e. unscented Kalman filter and deep Kalman filter) in estimation scenarios showed promising results for the MFR-PINP model as a viable option in real-time estimation tasks."}

However, extending these methods to quadruped robots remains challenging due to their distinct and highly dynamic motion patterns. Models that perform well on pedestrian data often experience severe degradation when deployed on legged platforms. To tackle this challenge, we introduce X-IONet, a cross-platform inertial odometry framework that operates solely using a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). X-IONet incorporates a rule-based expert selection module to classify motion platforms and route IMU sequences to platform-specific expert networks. The displacement prediction network features a dual-stage attention architecture that jointly models long-range temporal dependencies and inter-axis correlations, enabling accurate motion representation. It outputs both displacement and associated uncertainty, which are further fused through an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for robust state estimation. Extensive experiments on public pedestrian datasets and a self-collected quadruped robot dataset demonstrate that X-IONet achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 14.3% and Relative Trajectory Error (RTE) by 11.4% on pedestrian data, and by 52.8% and 41.3% on quadruped robot data.

In this paper, we propose a learning framework that enables the robot to acquire a diverse repertoire of omnidirectional gaits without reference motions. Each body part is controlled by a phase variable capable of forward and backward evolution, with a phase coverage reward to promote the exploration of the leg phase space. Additionally, morphological symmetry of the robot is incorporated via data augmentation, improving sample efficiency and enforcing both motion-level and task-level symmetry in learned behaviors. Extensive experiments show that the robot successfully acquires 22 omnidirectional gaits exhibiting both dynamic and symmetric movements, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework."}

However, current intent inference methods often ignore subtle motion that can be strong indicators for a sudden change in intent. Specifically, we aim to tackle 1) if we can detect sudden jumps in operator trajectories, 2) how we appropriately use these sudden jump motions to infer an operator's goal state, and 3) how to incorporate these discontinuous and continuous dynamics to infer operator motion. Our framework, called Psychic, models these small indicative motions through a jump-drift-diffusion stochastic differential equation to cover discontinuous and continuous dynamics. Kramers-Moyal (KM) coefficients allow us to detect jumps with a trajectory which we pair with a statistical outlier detection algorithm to nominate goal transitions. Through identifying jumps, we can perform early detection of existing goals and discover undefined goals in unstructured scenarios. Our framework then applies a Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) model using KM coefficients with the goal transitions as a control input to infer an operator's motion behavior in unstructured scenarios. We demonstrate Psychic can produce probabilistic reachability sets and compare our strategy to a negative log-likelihood model fit. We perform a retrospective study on 600 operator trajectories in a hands-free teleoperation task to evaluate the efficacy of our opensource package, Psychic, in both offline and online learning."}

Here, we propose a tactile-encoded BCI that leverages sensory afferents through a novel tactile-evoked P300 paradigm, allowing intuitive and reliable decoding of supernumerary motor intentions even when superimposed with voluntary actions. The interface was evaluated in a multi-day experiment comprising of a single motor recognition task to validate baseline BCI performance and a dual task paradigm to assess the potential influence between the BCI and natural human movement. The brain interface achieved real-time and reliable decoding of four supernumerary degrees of freedom, with significant performance improvements after only three days of training. Importantly, after training, performance did not differ significantly between the single- and dual-BCI task conditions, and natural movement remained unimpaired during concurrent supernumerary control. Lastly, the interface was deployed in a movement augmentation task, demonstrating its ability to command two supernumerary robotic arms for functional assistance during bimanual tasks. These results establish a new neural interface paradigm for movement augmentation through stimulation of sensory afferents, expanding motor degrees of freedom without impairing natural movement."}

The resection planner operates directly on segmented CT volumes of prostate phantoms, automatically generating tool trajectories for a three-phase median lobe resection workflow: left/median trough resection, right/median trough resection, and median blunt dissection. The retraction network, PushCVAE, trained on surgeon demonstrations, generates retractions according to the procedural phase.

While recent rectified flow approaches have advanced visuomotor policy learning, they suffer from a key limitation: After iterative distillation, generated actions may deviate from the ground-truth actions corresponding to the current visual observation, leading to accumulated error as the reflow process repeats and unstable task execution. We present Selective Flow Alignment (SeFA), an efficient and accurate visuomotor policy learning framework. SeFA resolves this challenge by a selective flow alignment strategy, which leverages expert demonstrations to selectively correct generated actions and restore consistency with observations, while preserving multimodality. This design introduces a consistency correction mechanism that ensures generated actions remain observation-aligned without sacrificing the efficiency of one-step flow inference. Extensive experiments across both simulated and real-world manipulation tasks show that SeFA Policy surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and flow-based policies, achieving superior accuracy and robustness while reducing inference latency by over 98%. By unifying rectified flow efficiency with observation-consistent action generation, SeFA provides a scalable and dependable solution for real-time visuomotor policy learning.
