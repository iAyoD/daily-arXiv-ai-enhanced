However, to unlock such multimodal potential, robots need to learn the correlations between an object's visual appearance and the sound it generates when they interact with it. Such an active sensorimotor experience requires new interaction capabilities, representations, and exploration methods to guide the robot in efficiently building increasingly rich audiovisual knowledge. In this work, we present CAVER, a novel robot that builds and utilizes rich audiovisual representations of objects. CAVER includes three novel contributions: 1) a novel 3D printed end-effector, attachable to parallel grippers, that excites objects' audio responses, 2) an audiovisual representation that combines local and global appearance information with sound features, and 3) an exploration algorithm that uses and builds the audiovisual representation in a curiosity-driven manner that prioritizes interacting with high uncertainty objects to obtain good coverage of surprising audio with fewer interactions. We demonstrate that CAVER builds rich representations in different scenarios more efficiently than several exploration baselines, and that the learned audiovisual representation leads to significant improvements in material classification and the imitation of audio-only human demonstrations. https://caver-bot.github.io/", "AI": {"tldr": "CAVER\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u672b\u7aef\u6267\u884c\u5668\u3001\u89c6\u542c\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u89c6\u542c\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6750\u6599\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u6f14\u793a\u6a21\u4eff\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u542c\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u5916\u89c2\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u58f0\u97f3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u8fd9\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1) 3D\u6253\u5370\u672b\u7aef\u6267\u884c\u5668\u6fc0\u53d1\u7269\u4f53\u97f3\u9891\u54cd\u5e94\uff1b2) \u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5916\u89c2\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u58f0\u97f3\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u89c6\u542c\u8868\u5f81\uff1b3) \u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "CAVER\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6bd4\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6784\u5efa\u4e30\u5bcc\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89c6\u542c\u8868\u5f81\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6750\u6599\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u7eaf\u97f3\u9891\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u7684\u6a21\u4eff\u3002", "conclusion": "CAVER\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u542c\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Yet most robot learning algorithms remain blind to time. We introduce time-aware policy learning, a reinforcement learning framework that enables robots to explicitly perceive and reason with time as a first-class variable. The framework augments conventional reinforcement policies with two complementary temporal signals, the remaining time and a time ratio, which allow a single policy to modulate its behavior continuously from rapid and dynamic to cautious and precise execution. By jointly optimizing punctuality and stability, the robot learns to balance efficiency, robustness, resiliency, and punctuality without re-training or reward adjustment. Across diverse manipulation domains from long-horizon pick and place, to granular-media pouring, articulated-object handling, and multi-agent object delivery, the time-aware policy produces adaptive behaviors that outperform standard reinforcement learning baselines by up to 48% in efficiency, 8 times more robust in sim-to-real transfer, and 90% in acoustic quietness while maintaining near-perfect success rates. Explicit temporal reasoning further enables real-time human-in-the-loop control and multi-agent coordination, allowing robots to recover from disturbances, re-synchronize after delays, and align motion tempo with human intent. By treating time not as a constraint but as a controllable dimension of behavior, time-aware policy learning provides a unified foundation for efficient, robust, resilient, and human-aligned robot autonomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9996\u8981\u53d8\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5269\u4f59\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u7387\u4e24\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f7f\u5355\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u8c28\u614e\u7cbe\u786e\u6267\u884c\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u8c03\u8282\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u591a\u6570\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u7f3a\u4e4f\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u65f6\u95f4\u610f\u8bc6\u662f\u52a8\u7269\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u52a8\u4f5c\u5982\u4f55\u6392\u5e8f\u3001\u8c03\u6574\u8282\u594f\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u589e\u5f3a\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5269\u4f59\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u7387\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u51c6\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5956\u52b1\u8c03\u6574\u5c31\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u65f6\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u64cd\u4f5c\u9886\u57df\uff08\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u62fe\u653e\u3001\u9897\u7c92\u4ecb\u8d28\u503e\u5012\u3001\u5173\u8282\u5bf9\u8c61\u5904\u7406\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u8c61\u9012\u9001\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe48%\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u8f6c\u79fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u9ad88\u500d\uff0c\u58f0\u5b66\u5b89\u9759\u5ea6\u63d0\u534790%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u4e3a\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u7ef4\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u6709\u97e7\u6027\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Existing methods typically build networks on top of 2D visual backbones and depend heavily on labeled data for training, which is often scarce in real-world scenarios, causing a sim-to-real gap. Moreover, these approaches reduce the 3D-based problem to 2D domain, neglecting the 3D priors. To address these, we propose Robot Topological Alignment Graph (RoboTAG), which incorporates a 3D branch to inject 3D priors while enabling co-evolution of the 2D and 3D representations, alleviating the reliance on labels. Specifically, the RoboTAG consists of a 3D branch and a 2D branch, where nodes represent the states of the camera and robot system, and edges capture the dependencies between these variables or denote alignments between them.

Within the pipeline, we construct the optimal QP formulation with the dynamic nullspace and the impedance tracking as the novel optimal controller to achieve compliant pose tracking and singularity avoidance. Regarding the optimal controller, it adaptively adjusts the weights assignment depending on the robot joint manipulability that reflects the state of joint configuration for the pose tracking in the form of impedance control and singularity avoidance with nullspace tracking.

Task and motion planning (TAMP) methods interleave the two processes of task planning and motion planning to ensure goal achievement and motion feasibility. Within the TAMP context, we are concerned with the mobile manipulation (MoMa) of multiple objects, where it is necessary to interleave actions for navigation and manipulation.\n  In particular, we aim to compute where and how each object should be placed given underspecified goals, such as ``set up dinner table with a fork, knife and plate.'' We leverage the rich common sense knowledge from large language models (LLMs), e.g., about how tableware is organized, to facilitate both task-level and motion-level planning. In addition, we use computer vision methods to learn a strategy for selecting base positions to facilitate MoMa behaviors, where the base position corresponds to the robot's ``footprint'' and orientation in its operating space. Altogether, this article provides a principled TAMP framework for MoMa tasks that accounts for common sense about object rearrangement and is adaptive to novel situations that include many objects that need to be moved. We performed quantitative experiments in both real-world settings and simulated environments. We evaluated the success rate and efficiency in completing long-horizon object rearrangement tasks.

Videos, including those of humans or teleoperated robots, capture rich physical interactions. However, most of them lack labeled actions, which limits their use in robot learning. We present Video Prediction for Robot Actions (ViPRA), a simple pretraining-finetuning framework that learns continuous robot control from these actionless videos. Instead of directly predicting actions, we train a video-language model to predict both future visual observations and motion-centric latent actions, which serve as intermediate representations of scene dynamics. We train these latent actions using perceptual losses and optical flow consistency to ensure they reflect physically grounded behavior. For downstream control, we introduce a chunked flow matching decoder that maps latent actions to robot-specific continuous action sequences, using only 100 to 200 teleoperated demonstrations. This approach avoids expensive action annotation, supports generalization across embodiments, and enables smooth, high-frequency continuous control upto 22 Hz via chunked action decoding.

Because of their nonlinear, underactuated dynamics and the partial observability of wind fields, prior work has largely relied on model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods to design near-optimal control schemes for station-keeping. These methods often compare only against hand-crafted heuristics, dismissing model-based approaches as impractical given the system complexity and uncertain wind forecasts. We revisit this assumption about the efficacy of model-based control for station-keeping by developing First-Order Model Predictive Control (FOMPC). By implementing the wind and balloon dynamics as differentiable functions in JAX, we enable gradient-based trajectory optimization for online planning. FOMPC outperforms a state-of-the-art RL policy, achieving a 24% improvement in time-within-radius (TWR) without requiring offline training, though at the cost of greater online computation per control step. Through systematic ablations of modeling assumptions and control factors, we show that online planning is effective across many configurations, including under simplified wind and dynamics models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5(FOMPC)\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7a7a\u6c14\u7403\u7ad9\u63a7\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e8624%\u7684\u7ad9\u63a7\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u9ad8\u7a7a\u6c14\u7403\u7ad9\u63a7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7531\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u98ce\u573a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u800c\u53ea\u80fd\u4f9d\u8d56\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528JAX\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u98ce\u573a\u548c\u6c14\u7403\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86FOMPC\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "FOMPC\u5728\u65f6\u95f4-\u534a\u5f84\u5185\u505c\u7559\u65f6\u95f4(TWR)\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684RL\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u4e8624%\uff0c\u4f46\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63a7\u5236\u6b65\u9aa4\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u5728\u7ebf\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u90fd\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u98ce\u573a\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u7a7a\u6c14\u7403\u7ad9\u63a7\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We propose that polyurethane rubber, used for high-load applications like shoe soles, rubber wheels, and industrial gaskets, may provide improved physical gel resilience, potentially at the cost of sensitivity. To compare the resilience and sensitivity of silicone and polyurethane VBTS gels, we propose a series of standard evaluation benchmarking protocols. Our resilience tests assess sensor durability across normal loading, shear loading, and abrasion. For sensitivity, we introduce model-free assessments of force and spatial sensitivity to directly measure the physical capabilities of each gel without effects introduced from data and model quality.

In our approach, each robot autonomously plans its path and shares this information with a centralized node. The centralized system detects potential conflicts and allows only one of the conflicting robots to proceed at a time, instructing others to stop outside the conflicting area to avoid deadlocks. Unlike traditional centralized planning methods, our system does not dictate robot paths but instead provides stop commands, functioning as a virtual traffic light. In simulation experiments with multiple robots, our approach increased the success rate of robots reaching their goals while reducing deadlocks.

Current neural controllers for humanoids remain modest in size, target a limited behavior set, and are trained on a handful of GPUs over several days. We show that scaling up model capacity, data, and compute yields a generalist humanoid controller capable of creating natural and robust whole-body movements. Specifically, we posit motion tracking as a natural and scalable task for humanoid control, leverageing dense supervision from diverse motion-capture data to acquire human motion priors without manual reward engineering. We build a foundation model for motion tracking by scaling along three axes: network size (from 1.2M to 42M parameters), dataset volume (over 100M frames, 700 hours of high-quality motion data), and compute (9k GPU hours). Beyond demonstrating the benefits of scale, we show the practical utility of our model through two mechanisms: (1) a real-time universal kinematic planner that bridges motion tracking to downstream task execution, enabling natural and interactive control, and (2) a unified token space that supports various motion input interfaces, such as VR teleoperation devices, human videos, and vision-language-action (VLA) models, all using the same policy. Scaling motion tracking exhibits favorable properties: performance improves steadily with increased compute and data diversity, and learned representations generalize to unseen motions, establishing motion tracking at scale as a practical foundation for humanoid control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u3001\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u81ea\u7136\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u5168\u8eab\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u901a\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5343\u4e2aGPU\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u5f62\u63a7\u5236\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u672a\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6536\u76ca\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u4eba\u5f62\u795e\u7ecf\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u89c4\u6a21\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u5f62\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5bc6\u96c6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u5956\u52b1\u5de5\u7a0b\u3002\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6269\u5c55\uff1a\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\uff081.2M\u523042M\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\uff08\u8d85\u8fc71\u4ebf\u5e27\uff0c700\u5c0f\u65f6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\uff09\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff089k GPU\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u7740\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u7a33\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u901a\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u6807\u8bb0\u7a7a\u95f4\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f93\u5165\u63a5\u53e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u5f62\u63a7\u5236\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u4eba\u5f62\u63a7\u5236\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

The UAV is modeled as a variable-speed Dubins vehicle with a line-of-sight sensor in an urban environment that may occlude the sensor's view of the POI. A search strategy is proposed that exploits a probabilistic visibility volume (VV) to plan its future motion with iterative deepening $A^\\ast$. The probabilistic VV is a time-varying three-dimensional representation of the sensing constraints for a particular distribution of the POI's state. To find the path most likely to view the POI, the planner uses a heuristic to optimistically estimate the probability of viewing the POI over a time horizon. The probabilistic VV is max-pooled to create a variable-timestep planner that reduces the search space and balances long-term and short-term planning.

In this paper, we explore the phenomenon of layer jamming, which is a popular stiffness modulation mechanism that provides an equivalent capability for soft robots. More specifically, we focus on mechanical layer jamming, which we realise through two-layer multi material structure with tooth-like protrusions. We identify key design parameters for mechanical layer jamming systems, including the ability to modulate stiffness, and perform a variety of comprehensive tests placing the specimens under bending and torsional loads to understand the influence of our selected design parameters (mainly tooth geometry) on the performance of the jammed structures.

Model-based locomotion approaches typically adopt heuristic methods or planning based on the linear inverted pendulum model. These methods account for linear velocity in footstep planning, while excluding angular velocity, which leads to angular momentum being handled exclusively via ground reaction force (GRF). Footstep planning based on MPC that takes angular velocity into account recasts the angular momentum control problem as a dual-input approach that coordinates GRFs and footstep placement, instead of optimizing GRFs alone, thereby improving tracking performance. A mutual-feedback loop couples the footstep planner and the GRF MPC, with each using the other's solution to iteratively update footsteps and GRFs. The use of optimal solutions reduces body oscillation and enables extended stance and swing phases. The method is validated on a quadruped robot, demonstrating robust locomotion with reduced oscillations, longer stance and swing phases across various terrains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u811a\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u811a\u6b65\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6765\u7a33\u5065\u8c03\u8282\u8eab\u4f53\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u4e0d\u671f\u671b\u7684\u8eab\u4f53\u65cb\u8f6c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u5012\u7acb\u6446\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u811a\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u7ebf\u6027\u901f\u5ea6\u4f46\u6392\u9664\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u53ea\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5730\u9762\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eMPC\u7684\u811a\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\u8003\u8651\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c06\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u534f\u8c03\u5730\u9762\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\u548c\u811a\u6b65\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u53cc\u8f93\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5355\u72ec\u4f18\u5316\u5730\u9762\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\u3002\u811a\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u548c\u5730\u9762\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u529bMPC\u5f62\u6210\u76f8\u4e92\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5404\u81ea\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u65b9\u7684\u89e3\u6765\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\u811a\u6b65\u548c\u5730\u9762\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8eab\u4f53\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u7ad9\u7acb\u548c\u6446\u52a8\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u5728\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u632f\u8361\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u7ad9\u7acb\u548c\u6446\u52a8\u9636\u6bb5\u5ef6\u957f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u811a\u6b65\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5730\u9762\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\u7684\u53cc\u8f93\u5165\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002"}}

This paper develops a novel approach that combines tangentbased path planning and extrapolation methods to create a new decision-making algorithm for local path planning. In the assumed scenario, a UGV has a prior knowledge of its initial and target points within the dynamic environment. A global path has already been computed, and the robot is provided with waypoints along this path. As the UGV travels between these waypoints, the algorithm aims to avoid collisions with dynamic obstacles. These obstacles follow polynomial trajectories, with their initial positions randomized in the local map and velocities randomized between O and the allowable physical velocity limit of the robot, along with some random accelerations. The developed algorithm is tested in several scenarios where many dynamic obstacles move randomly in the environment. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed local path planning strategy by gradually generating a collision free path which allows the robot to navigate safely between initial and the target locations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5207\u7ebf\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5916\u63a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u907f\u969c\u5bfc\u822a", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u52a8\u6001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u6765\u907f\u514d\u78b0\u649e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u5f85\u63d0\u5347", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5207\u7ebf\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5916\u63a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u822a\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u9075\u5faa\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u907f\u969c\u51b3\u7b56", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9010\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u822a", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u786e\u4fdd\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u822a"}}

We present a thorough experimental analysis of the results obtained using two approaches; one that uses sensor fusion between the camera and LiDAR to detect and track the obstacles and the other uses only the LiDAR point cloud for the detection and tracking. In the end, we propose a hybrid approach that merges the advantages of both approaches to build an informative obstacles map of the surrounding environment to the USV.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86USV\u5728\u6d77\u6d0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u969c\u788d\u7269\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u548c\u7eafLiDAR\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u6c34\u9762\u8247(USV)\u5728\u6d77\u6d0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5f00\u53d1\u9c81\u68d2\u6709\u6548\u7684\u969c\u788d\u7269\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6700\u65b0\u6d77\u6d0b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728ROS\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u96c6\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528MIT\u6d77\u6d0b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u540c\u6b65LiDAR\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u7eafLiDAR\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u76f8\u673a\u548cLiDAR\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7eafLiDAR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u6d4b\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u548c\u7eafLiDAR\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3aUSV\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5468\u56f4\u73af\u5883\u969c\u788d\u7269\u5730\u56fe\u3002"}}

Recent work has identified game theory, particularly the concept of Nash Equilibrium (NE), as a key enabler for behavior-aware decision-making. Yet, existing work falls short of fully unleashing the power of game-theoretic reasoning. Specifically, popular optimization-based methods require simplified robot dynamics and tend to get trapped in local minima due to convexification. Other works that rely on payoff matrices suffer from poor scalability due to the explicit enumeration of all possible trajectories. To bridge this gap, we introduce Game-Theoretic Nested Search (GTNS), a novel, scalable, and provably correct approach for computing NEs in general dynamical systems. GTNS efficiently searches the action space of all agents involved, while discarding trajectories that violate the NE constraint (no unilateral deviation) through an inner search over a lower-dimensional space. Our algorithm enables explicit selection among equilibria by utilizing a user-specified global objective, thereby capturing a rich set of realistic interactions. We demonstrate the approach on a variety of autonomous driving and racing scenarios where we achieve solutions in mere seconds on commodity hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGame-Theoretic Nested Search (GTNS)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b80\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u7b80\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u9677\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6536\u76ca\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u679a\u4e3e\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u8f68\u8ff9\u800c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "method": "GTNS\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5957\u641c\u7d22\u9ad8\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u6240\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5185\u5c42\u641c\u7d22\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u4e22\u5f03\u8fdd\u53cd\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u5168\u5c40\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u5747\u8861\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u8d5b\u8f66\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u666e\u901a\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u4ec5\u9700\u6570\u79d2\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "GTNS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

Electrostatic film actuators offer several advantages, including thinness, flexibility, lightweight construction, and high open-loop positioning accuracy. However, the actuation stress exhibited by conventional actuators in air still needs improvement, particularly for the widely used three-phase electrode design. To enhance the output performance of actuators, this paper presents a two-layer electrostatic film actuator with an integrated brake. By alternately distributing electrodes on both the top and bottom layers, a smaller effective electrode pitch is achieved under the same fabrication constraints, resulting in an actuation stress of approximately 241~N/m$^2$, representing a 90.5\\% improvement over previous three-phase actuators operating in air. Furthermore, its integrated electrostatic adhesion mechanism enables load retention under braking mode. Several demonstrations, including a tug-of-war between a conventional single-layer actuator and the proposed two-layer actuator, a payload operation, a one-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, and a dual-mode gripper, were conducted to validate the actuator's advantageous capabilities in both actuation and braking modes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u5c42\u9759\u7535\u8584\u819c\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u5c42\u7684\u7535\u6781\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u5236\u9020\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7535\u6781\u95f4\u8ddd\uff0c\u4f7f\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u63d0\u534790.5%\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u5236\u52a8\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7535\u673a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u5927\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u3001\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u5236\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u7d27\u51d1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9759\u7535\u8584\u819c\u6267\u884c\u5668\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u8f7b\u8584\u3001\u67d4\u6027\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u548c\u9ad8\u5f00\u73af\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7b49\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7a7a\u6c14\u4e2d\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u4ecd\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u5c42\u9759\u7535\u8584\u819c\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u9876\u5c42\u548c\u5e95\u5c42\u4ea4\u66ff\u5206\u5e03\u7535\u6781\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7535\u6781\u95f4\u8ddd\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u9759\u7535\u5438\u9644\u5236\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u5236\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3002", "result": "\u6267\u884c\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea6241 N/m\u00b2\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u4e09\u76f8\u6267\u884c\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u4e8690.5%\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u6f14\u793a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u5236\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u5c42\u6267\u884c\u5668\u7684\u62d4\u6cb3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u5355\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u548c\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u5939\u722a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u53cc\u5c42\u9759\u7535\u8584\u819c\u6267\u884c\u5668\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u9a71\u52a8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u5236\u52a8\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u7d27\u51d1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u5236\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u5f02\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In contrast to typical swarm robotics research, our robots are elongated and exhibit complex kinematics, introducing unique challenges. Despite its relevance to real-world applications such as logistics automation, remote mining, airport baggage transport, and agricultural operations, this problem has not been addressed in the existing literature.\n  To tackle this new class of swarm robotics problems, we propose a purely reaction-based, decentralized swarm intelligence strategy tailored to automate elongated, articulated vehicles. The method presented in this paper prioritizes jackknifing avoidance and establishes a foundation for mutual collision avoidance.

While conventional numerical optimization methods can efficiently handle simple dynamics and cost structures, they often become intractable for the nonlinear or non-differentiable systems commonly encountered in robotics. This article provides a tutorial on probabilistic inference-based MPC, presenting a unified theoretical foundation and a comprehensive overview of representative methods. Probabilistic inference-based MPC approaches, such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control, have gained significant attention by reinterpreting optimal control as a problem of probabilistic inference. Rather than relying on gradient-based numerical optimization, these methods estimate optimal control distributions through sampling-based techniques, accommodating arbitrary cost functions and dynamics. We first derive the optimal control distribution from the standard optimal control problem, elucidating its probabilistic interpretation and key characteristics. The widely used MPPI algorithm is then derived as a practical example, followed by discussions on prior and variational distribution design, tuning principles, and theoretical aspects.

However, effective multi-agent interaction necessitates robust perspective-taking capabilities, enabling models to interpret both physical and epistemic viewpoints. Current training paradigms often neglect these interactive contexts, resulting in challenges when models must reason about the subjectivity of individual perspectives or navigate environments with multiple observers. This study evaluates whether explicitly incorporating diverse points of view using the ReAct framework, an approach that integrates reasoning and acting, can enhance an LLM's ability to understand and ground the demands of other agents. We extend the classic Director task by introducing active visual exploration across a suite of seven scenarios of increasing perspective-taking complexity. These scenarios are designed to challenge the agent's capacity to resolve referential ambiguity based on visual access and interaction, under varying state representations and prompting strategies, including ReAct-style reasoning. Our results demonstrate that explicit perspective cues, combined with active exploration strategies, significantly improve the model's interpretative accuracy and collaborative effectiveness.

Despite their success in open-loop evaluations, these systems often exhibit significant performance degradation in closed-loop scenarios due to causal confusion. This confusion is fundamentally exacerbated by the overreliance of the imitation learning paradigm on expert trajectories, which often contain unattributable noise and interfere with the modeling of causal relationships between environmental contexts and appropriate driving actions.\n  To address this fundamental limitation, we propose Perception-Guided Self-Supervision (PGS) - a simple yet effective training paradigm that leverages perception outputs as the primary supervisory signals, explicitly modeling causal relationships in decision-making. The proposed framework aligns both the inputs and outputs of the decision-making module with perception results, such as lane centerlines and the predicted motions of surrounding agents, by introducing positive and negative self-supervision for the ego trajectory. This alignment is specifically designed to mitigate causal confusion arising from the inherent noise in expert trajectories.\n  Equipped with perception-driven supervision, our method, built on a standard end-to-end architecture, achieves a Driving Score of 78.08 and a mean success rate of 48.64% on the challenging closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods, including those employing more complex network architectures and inference pipelines. These results underscore the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed PGS framework and point to a promising direction for addressing causal confusion and enhancing real-world generalization in autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u611f\u77e5\u5f15\u5bfc\u81ea\u76d1\u7763(PGS)\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u8f93\u51fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u8d1f\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u9f50\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u5757\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u566a\u58f0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u95ed\u73afBench2Drive\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5f00\u73af\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u95ed\u73af\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56e0\u56e0\u679c\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6df7\u6dc6\u6e90\u4e8e\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u53ef\u5f52\u56e0\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e72\u6270\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u9a7e\u9a76\u52a8\u4f5c\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "PGS\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u8f93\u51fa(\u5982\u8f66\u9053\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u548c\u5468\u56f4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd0\u52a8)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u8d1f\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u9f50\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u56fa\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u95ed\u73afBench2Drive\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f9778.08\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u5206\u6570\u548c48.64%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PGS\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u56e0\u679c\u6df7\u6dc6\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

With the ever-increasing incorporation of these data-driven models into the estimation domain, model predictions with reliable margins of error are a requirement -- especially for safety-critical applications. This paper discusses the application of a novel real-time, data-driven estimation approach based on the multi-fidelity residual physics-informed neural process (MFR-PINP) toward the real-time state estimation of a robotic system. Specifically, we address the model-mismatch issue of selecting an accurate kinematic model by tasking the MFR-PINP to also learn the residuals between simple, low-fidelity predictions and complex, high-fidelity ground-truth dynamics. To account for model uncertainty present in a physical implementation, robust uncertainty guarantees from the split conformal (SC) prediction framework are modeled in the training and inference paradigms. We provide implementation details of our MFR-PINP-based estimator for a hybrid online learning setting to validate our model's usage in real-time applications. Experimental results of our approach's performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art variants of the Kalman filter (i.e. unscented Kalman filter and deep Kalman filter) in estimation scenarios showed promising results for the MFR-PINP model as a viable option in real-time estimation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6b8b\u5dee\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u8fc7\u7a0b(MFR-PINP)\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7b80\u5355\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u590d\u6742\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u771f\u5b9e\u52a8\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u88c2\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u9009\u62e9\u51c6\u786e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6b8b\u5dee\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u8fc7\u7a0b(MFR-PINP)\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u771f\u5b9e\u52a8\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u88c2\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u5efa\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u53d8\u4f53(\u65e0\u8ff9\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668)\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cMFR-PINP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f30\u8ba1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "MFR-PINP\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u8bef\u5dee\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002"}}

However, extending these methods to quadruped robots remains challenging due to their distinct and highly dynamic motion patterns. Models that perform well on pedestrian data often experience severe degradation when deployed on legged platforms. To tackle this challenge, we introduce X-IONet, a cross-platform inertial odometry framework that operates solely using a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). X-IONet incorporates a rule-based expert selection module to classify motion platforms and route IMU sequences to platform-specific expert networks. The displacement prediction network features a dual-stage attention architecture that jointly models long-range temporal dependencies and inter-axis correlations, enabling accurate motion representation. It outputs both displacement and associated uncertainty, which are further fused through an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for robust state estimation. Extensive experiments on public pedestrian datasets and a self-collected quadruped robot dataset demonstrate that X-IONet achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 14.3% and Relative Trajectory Error (RTE) by 11.4% on pedestrian data, and by 52.8% and 41.3% on quadruped robot data.

However, existing controllers cannot fully exploit these morphological features and largely rely on predefined gait patterns or joint trajectories, which prevents the generation of diverse and flexible locomotion and limits their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a learning framework that enables the robot to acquire a diverse repertoire of omnidirectional gaits without reference motions.

However, current intent inference methods often ignore subtle motion that can be strong indicators for a sudden change in intent. Specifically, we aim to tackle 1) if we can detect sudden jumps in operator trajectories, 2) how we appropriately use these sudden jump motions to infer an operator's goal state, and 3) how to incorporate these discontinuous and continuous dynamics to infer operator motion. Our framework, called Psychic, models these small indicative motions through a jump-drift-diffusion stochastic differential equation to cover discontinuous and continuous dynamics. Kramers-Moyal (KM) coefficients allow us to detect jumps with a trajectory which we pair with a statistical outlier detection algorithm to nominate goal transitions. Through identifying jumps, we can perform early detection of existing goals and discover undefined goals in unstructured scenarios. Our framework then applies a Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) model using KM coefficients with the goal transitions as a control input to infer an operator's motion behavior in unstructured scenarios. We demonstrate Psychic can produce probabilistic reachability sets and compare our strategy to a negative log-likelihood model fit.

The brain interface achieved real-time and reliable decoding of four supernumerary degrees of freedom, with significant performance improvements after only three days of training. Importantly, after training, performance did not differ significantly between the single- and dual-BCI task conditions, and natural movement remained unimpaired during concurrent supernumerary control. Lastly, the interface was deployed in a movement augmentation task, demonstrating its ability to command two supernumerary robotic arms for functional assistance during bimanual tasks.

This work presents a coordinated model-based resection planner and learning-based retraction network that work together to enable semi-autonomous tissue resection using a dual-arm transurethral concentric tube robot (the Virtuoso). The resection planner operates directly on segmented CT volumes of prostate phantoms, automatically generating tool trajectories for a three-phase median lobe resection workflow: left/median trough resection, right/median trough resection, and median blunt dissection. The retraction network, PushCVAE, trained on surgeon demonstrations, generates retractions according to the procedural phase. The procedure is executed under Level-3 (supervised) autonomy on a prostate phantom composed of hydrogel materials that replicate the mechanical and cutting properties of tissue. As a feasibility study, we demonstrate that our combined autonomous system achieves a 97.1% resection of the targeted volume of the median lobe.

While existing methods can adapt behaviors, they often fail to guarantee safety in safety-critical domains. We propose a safety-guaranteed, optimal, and efficient approach to solve the learning problem from preferences, rankings, or demonstrations using Weighted Signal Temporal Logic (WSTL). WSTL learning problems, when implemented naively, lead to multi-linear constraints in the weights to be learned. By introducing structural pruning and log-transform procedures, we reduce the problem size and recast the problem as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program while preserving safety guarantees.

While recent rectified flow approaches have advanced visuomotor policy learning, they suffer from a key limitation: After iterative distillation, generated actions may deviate from the ground-truth actions corresponding to the current visual observation, leading to accumulated error as the reflow process repeats and unstable task execution. We present Selective Flow Alignment (SeFA), an efficient and accurate visuomotor policy learning framework. SeFA resolves this challenge by a selective flow alignment strategy, which leverages expert demonstrations to selectively correct generated actions and restore consistency with observations, while preserving multimodality. This design introduces a consistency correction mechanism that ensures generated actions remain observation-aligned without sacrificing the efficiency of one-step flow inference. Extensive experiments across both simulated and real-world manipulation tasks show that SeFA Policy surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and flow-based policies, achieving superior accuracy and robustness while reducing inference latency by over 98%. By unifying rectified flow efficiency with observation-consistent action generation, SeFA provides a scalable and dependable solution for real-time visuomotor policy learning.
