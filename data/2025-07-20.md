TL;DR: EaGERS是一个无需训练、模型无关的流程，通过视觉语言模型生成自然语言解释，并通过多模态嵌入相似性和多数投票将其定位到空间子区域，最终仅从相关区域生成响应。在DocVQA数据集上表现优于基准模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升DocVQA任务的透明度和可重复性，同时避免额外的模型微调。

Method: 1. 生成自然语言解释；2. 通过多模态嵌入相似性和多数投票定位到空间子区域；3. 仅从相关区域生成响应。

Result: 在DocVQA数据集上，EaGERS在精确匹配和ANLS指标上优于基准模型。

Conclusion: EaGERS无需额外训练即可提升DocVQA任务的性能和透明度。

Abstract: We introduce EaGERS, a fully training-free and model-agnostic pipeline that
(1) generates natural language rationales via a vision language model, (2)
grounds these rationales to spatial sub-regions by computing multimodal
embedding similarities over a configurable grid with majority voting, and (3)
restricts the generation of responses only from the relevant regions selected
in the masked image. Experiments on the DocVQA dataset demonstrate that our
best configuration not only outperforms the base model on exact match accuracy
and Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity metrics but also enhances
transparency and reproducibility in DocVQA without additional model
fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MindJourney框架通过将视觉语言模型（VLM）与基于视频扩散的可控世界模型结合，提升了3D空间推理能力，无需微调即可在基准测试中平均提升8%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在3D空间推理任务中表现不佳，缺乏对3D动态的内部建模能力。

Method: MindJourney框架通过VLM迭代生成相机轨迹，世界模型合成多视角图像，VLM基于多视角证据进行推理。

Result: 在SAT基准测试中平均性能提升8%，优于基于强化学习的VLM。

Conclusion: 结合世界模型的测试时扩展方法为3D推理提供了一种简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D space is central to human cognition and indispensable
for embodied tasks such as navigation and manipulation. However,
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks
as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion:
they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore
propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this
missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video
diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the
world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then
reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive
exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average
8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT,
showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a
simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also
improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement
learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world
models for test-time scaling.

### [3] [NeuraLeaf: Neural Parametric Leaf Models with Shape and Deformation Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12714)
*Yang Yang,Dongni Mao,Hiroaki Santo,Yasuyuki Matsushita,Fumio Okura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuraLeaf是一种用于植物叶片建模和重建的神经参数模型，通过分离2D基础形状和3D变形，解决了叶片形状多样性和柔性变形的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 植物叶片在农业和计算机图形学中具有重要意义，但其多样性和柔性变形对建模提出了独特挑战。

Method: NeuraLeaf将叶片几何分离为2D基础形状和3D变形，利用2D叶片图像数据集学习基础形状，并提出无骨架的蒙皮模型处理3D变形。

Result: NeuraLeaf成功生成多种叶片形状并实现精确的3D观测拟合。

Conclusion: NeuraLeaf为叶片建模提供了一种高效方法，并公开了实现和数据集。

Abstract: We develop a neural parametric model for 3D leaves for plant modeling and
reconstruction that are essential for agriculture and computer graphics. While
neural parametric models are actively studied for humans and animals, plant
leaves present unique challenges due to their diverse shapes and flexible
deformation. To this problem, we introduce a neural parametric model for
leaves, NeuraLeaf. Capitalizing on the fact that flattened leaf shapes can be
approximated as a 2D plane, NeuraLeaf disentangles the leaves' geometry into
their 2D base shapes and 3D deformations. This representation allows learning
from rich sources of 2D leaf image datasets for the base shapes, and also has
the advantage of simultaneously learning textures aligned with the geometry. To
model the 3D deformation, we propose a novel skeleton-free skinning model and
create a newly captured 3D leaf dataset called DeformLeaf. We show that
NeuraLeaf successfully generates a wide range of leaf shapes with deformation,
resulting in accurate model fitting to 3D observations like depth maps and
point clouds. Our implementation and dataset are available at
https://neuraleaf-yang.github.io/.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的单模态大型语言模型（MLLM）Mono-InternVL及其改进版Mono-InternVL-1.5，通过引入视觉参数空间和创新的预训练策略，解决了现有模型优化不稳定和灾难性遗忘的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单模态MLLM在结构和预训练策略上存在优化不稳定和灾难性遗忘的挑战，需要一种更稳定的方法来学习视觉知识。

Method: 提出Mono-InternVL，采用多模态专家混合架构和创新的内源性视觉预训练（EViP）；进一步改进为Mono-InternVL-1.5，引入视觉注意力专家和高效预训练流程。

Abstract: This paper focuses on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
which integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single model.
Existing structures and pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often
suffer from unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. To address these
challenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a
pre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data
via delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an
advanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a
multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an
innovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize
its visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves
competitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively
expensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper
and stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++
introduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and
re-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,
it includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these
designs, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,
while still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate
our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out
of 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared
to its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves
similar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.

Abstract: Crop mapping involves identifying and classifying crop types using spatial
data, primarily derived from remote sensing imagery. This study presents the
first comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,
encompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer
learning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,
we conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite
image-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise
classification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of
varied training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified
optimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.
The evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural
sites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from
CDL trusted pixels and field surveys.
  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval
preprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal
performance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid
training and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and
direct transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques
enhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop
classes while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,
workflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a
sufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate
and generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that
matches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop
mapping. Repository:

Conclusion: 该研究填补了CT眼动数据集的空白，并提出了创新的3D扫描路径预测方法，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding radiologists' eye movement during Computed Tomography (CT)
reading is crucial for developing effective interpretable computer-aided
diagnosis systems. However, CT research in this area has been limited by the
lack of publicly available eye-tracking datasets and the three-dimensional
complexity of CT volumes. To address these challenges, we present the first
publicly available eye gaze dataset on CT, called CT-ScanGaze. Then, we
introduce CT-Searcher, a novel 3D scanpath predictor designed specifically to
process CT volumes and generate radiologist-like 3D fixation sequences,
overcoming the limitations of current scanpath predictors that only handle 2D
inputs. Since deep learning models benefit from a pretraining step, we develop
a pipeline that converts existing 2D gaze datasets into 3D gaze data to
pretrain CT-Searcher. Through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on
CT-ScanGaze, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and provide a
comprehensive assessment framework for 3D scanpath prediction in medical
imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-DGCNN++是一种改进的多尺度动态图卷积网络，通过分层多尺度融合和语义特征提取，显著提升了树种类分类和3D物体识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在多尺度处理中未能捕捉树结构语义关系的问题。

Method: 采用分层多尺度融合动态图卷积网络，结合局部、分支和冠层尺度的语义特征提取与跨尺度信息传播。

Result: 在STPCTLS上达到94.96%的准确率，FOR-species20K上提升6.1%，在ModelNet40和ModelNet10上也表现优异。

Conclusion: MS-DGCNN++在资源受限的应用中保持高准确率，并可推广到其他点云处理任务。

Abstract: Tree species classification from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds is
challenging because of the complex multi-scale geometric structures in forest
environments. Existing approaches using multi-scale dynamic graph convolutional
neural networks (MS-DGCNN) employ parallel multi-scale processing, which fails
to capture the semantic relationships between the hierarchical levels of the
tree architecture. We present MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multiscale fusion
dynamic graph convolutional network that uses semantically meaningful feature
extraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information
propagation. Our method employs scale-specific feature engineering, including
standard geometric features for the local scale, normalized relative vectors
for the branch scale, and distance information for the canopy scale. This
hierarchical approach replaces uniform parallel processing with semantically
differentiated representations that are aligned with the natural tree
structure. Under the same proposed tree species data augmentation strategy for
all experiments, MS-DGCNN++ achieved an accuracy of 94.96 \% on STPCTLS,
outperforming DGCNN, MS-DGCNN, and the state-of-the-art model PPT. On
FOR-species20K, it achieves 67.25\% accuracy (6.1\% improvement compared to
MS-DGCNN). For standard 3D object recognition, our method outperformed DGCNN
and MS-DGCNN with overall accuracies of 93.15\% on ModelNet40 and 94.05\% on
ModelNet10. With lower parameters and reduced complexity compared to
state-of-the-art transformer approaches, our method is suitable for
resource-constrained applications while maintaining a competitive accuracy.
Beyond tree classification, the method generalizes to standard 3D object
recognition, establishing it as a versatile solution for diverse point cloud
processing applications. The implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/said-ohamouddou/MS-DGCNN2.

Abstract: Action anticipation has become a prominent topic in Human Action Recognition
(HAR). However, its application to real-world sports scenarios remains limited
by the availability of suitable annotated datasets. This work presents a novel
dataset of manually annotated soccer penalty kicks to predict shot direction
based on pre-kick player movements. We propose a deep learning classifier to
benchmark this dataset that integrates HAR-based feature embeddings with
contextual metadata. We evaluate twenty-two backbone models across seven
architecture families (MViTv2, MViTv1, SlowFast, Slow, X3D, I3D, C2D),
achieving up to 63.9% accuracy in predicting shot direction (left or right),
outperforming the real goalkeepers' decisions. These results demonstrate the
dataset's value for anticipatory action recognition and validate our model's
potential as a generalizable approach for sports-based predictive tasks.

TL;DR: Funnel-HOI框架通过编码器阶段引入HOI特定线索，结合非对称共注意力机制和新型损失函数，显著提升了人-物交互检测的性能。

Method: 提出Funnel-HOI框架，先探测物体再关联动作，利用非对称共注意力机制和多模态信息增强交互表示。

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO数据集上，未见和罕见HOI类别性能分别提升12.4%和8.4%。

Conclusion: 编码器阶段的HOI特定线索设计对提升交互检测性能至关重要。

Abstract: Human-object interaction detection (HOID) refers to localizing interactive
human-object pairs in images and identifying the interactions. Since there
could be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is
limited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot
learning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object
detectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their
primary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or
disentangled interpretations of interactions. We advocate that HOI-specific
cues must be anticipated at the encoder stage itself to obtain a stronger scene
interpretation. Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI
inspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then
associate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding. We first
probe an image for the presence of objects (well-defined concepts) and then
probe for actions (abstract concepts) associated with them. A novel asymmetric
co-attention mechanism mines these cues utilizing multimodal information
(incorporating zero-shot capabilities) and yields stronger interaction
representations at the encoder level. Furthermore, a novel loss is devised that
considers objectaction relatedness and regulates misclassification penalty
better than existing loss functions for guiding the interaction classifier.
Extensive experiments on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets across
fully-supervised and six zero-shot settings reveal our state-of-the-art
performance, with up to 12.4% and 8.4% gains for unseen and rare HOI
categories, respectively.

Method: 结合3D场景重建和2D视频扩散模型（CogNVS），通过自监督训练和零样本应用。

Result: CogNVS在动态场景新视角合成中表现优于大多数现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新结合3D重建与2D扩散模型，实现了高效且高质量的新视角合成。

Abstract: We explore novel-view synthesis for dynamic scenes from monocular videos.
Prior approaches rely on costly test-time optimization of 4D representations or
do not preserve scene geometry when trained in a feed-forward manner. Our
approach is based on three key insights: (1) covisible pixels (that are visible
in both the input and target views) can be rendered by first reconstructing the
dynamic 3D scene and rendering the reconstruction from the novel-views and (2)
hidden pixels in novel views can be "inpainted" with feed-forward 2D video
diffusion models. Notably, our video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) can be
self-supervised from 2D videos, allowing us to train it on a large corpus of
in-the-wild videos. This in turn allows for (3) CogNVS to be applied zero-shot
to novel test videos via test-time finetuning. We empirically verify that
CogNVS outperforms almost all prior art for novel-view synthesis of dynamic
scenes from monocular videos.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球主要死因，但现有风险分层方法难以检测早期亚临床变化。研究旨在整合视网膜微血管特征和血清脂质组学数据，填补早期心血管疾病发病机制的认知空白。

Method: 采用深度学习图像处理技术量化视网膜微血管特征，并通过超高效液相色谱-电喷雾电离高分辨质谱（UHPLC ESI HRMS）分析血清脂质组学数据，进行大规模协变量调整和分层相关性分析。

Conclusion: 该研究为心血管疾病的早期检测、靶向预防和个性化医疗提供了新的无创生物标志物，具有重要的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of mortality,
yet current risk stratification methods often fail to detect early, subclinical
changes. Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal
microvasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as
potential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics
framework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived
through deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to
highlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the
conventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate
adjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,
which is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal
phenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum
lipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography
Electrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS).
Strong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly
between average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as
triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These
associations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under
metabolic stress. By linking detailed
  vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a
critical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration
not only offers a novel perspective on microvascular metabolic associations but
also presents a significant opportunity for the identification of robust,
non-invasive biomarkers. Ultimately, these findings may support improved early
detection, targeted prevention, and personalized approaches in cardiovascular
healthcare.

Abstract: Automated structural defect segmentation in civil infrastructure faces a
critical challenge: achieving high accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency for real-time deployment. This paper presents FORTRESS
(Function-composition Optimized Real-Time Resilient Structural Segmentation), a
new architecture that balances accuracy and speed by using a special method
that combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network integration. FORTRESS incorporates three key innovations: a systematic
depthwise separable convolution framework achieving a 3.6x parameter reduction
per layer, adaptive TiKAN integration that selectively applies function
composition transformations only when computationally beneficial, and
multi-scale attention fusion combining spatial, channel, and KAN-enhanced
features across decoder levels. The architecture achieves remarkable efficiency
gains with 91% parameter reduction (31M to 2.9M), 91% computational complexity
reduction (13.7 to 1.17 GFLOPs), and 3x inference speed improvement while
delivering superior segmentation performance. Evaluation on benchmark
infrastructure datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art results with an F1- score
of 0.771 and a mean IoU of 0.677, significantly outperforming existing methods
including U-Net, SA-UNet, and U- KAN. The dual optimization strategy proves
essential for optimal performance, establishing FORTRESS as a robust solution
for practical structural defect segmentation in resource-constrained
environments where both accuracy and computational efficiency are paramount.

accuracy, enhanced responsiveness, reduced computational overhead, and improved
interpretability of our approach, thus establishing a new benchmark for
state-of-the-art performance in traffic accident anticipation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HairShifter提出了一种新颖的“锚帧+动画”框架，用于视频发型转换，结合了高质量图像转换与平滑视频动画，解决了时空一致性和动态适应性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频发型转换在社交媒体、游戏等领域需求增长，但现有方法在时空一致性和动态适应性上存在挑战。

Method: HairShifter框架包含图像发型转换模块（IHT）和多尺度门控SPADE解码器，确保空间融合和时间一致性。

Result: 实验表明，HairShifter在视频发型转换中实现了最先进的性能，兼具视觉质量、时间一致性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: HairShifter为视频发型转换提供了新方向，并建立了该领域的强基线。

Abstract: Hair transfer is increasingly valuable across domains such as social media,
gaming, advertising, and entertainment. While significant progress has been
made in single-image hair transfer, video-based hair transfer remains
challenging due to the need for temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and
dynamic adaptability. In this work, we propose HairShifter, a novel "Anchor
Frame + Animation" framework that unifies high-quality image hair transfer with
smooth and coherent video animation. At its core, HairShifter integrates a
Image Hair Transfer (IHT) module for precise per-frame transformation and a
Multi-Scale Gated SPADE Decoder to ensure seamless spatial blending and
temporal coherence. Our method maintains hairstyle fidelity across frames while
preserving non-hair regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairShifter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in video hairstyle transfer, combining
superior visual quality, temporal consistency, and scalability. The code will
be publicly available. We believe this work will open new avenues for
video-based hairstyle transfer and establish a robust baseline in this field.

TL;DR: Mamba Snake是一种基于状态空间建模的新型深度蛇形框架，用于统一医学图像分割（UMIS），通过多轮廓演化和能量图形状先验优化分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统像素级方法在多尺度结构异质性和器官间关系建模方面表现不佳，限制了UMIS的效果。

Method: 提出Mamba Snake框架，结合状态空间建模和蛇形算法，引入Mamba Evolution Block（MEB）和双分类协同机制。

Result: 在五个临床数据集上表现优异，Dice系数平均提升3%。

Conclusion: Mamba Snake通过建模宏观拓扑关系和微观轮廓细化，显著提升了UMIS的性能。

Abstract: Unified Medical Image Segmentation (UMIS) is critical for comprehensive
anatomical assessment but faces challenges due to multi-scale structural
heterogeneity. Conventional pixel-based approaches, lacking object-level
anatomical insight and inter-organ relational modeling, struggle with
morphological complexity and feature conflicts, limiting their efficacy in
UMIS. We propose Mamba Snake, a novel deep snake framework enhanced by state
space modeling for UMIS. Mamba Snake frames multi-contour evolution as a
hierarchical state space atlas, effectively modeling macroscopic inter-organ
topological relationships and microscopic contour refinements. We introduce a
snake-specific vision state space module, the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB),
which leverages effective spatiotemporal information aggregation for adaptive
refinement of complex morphologies. Energy map shape priors further ensure
robust long-range contour evolution in heterogeneous data. Additionally, a
dual-classification synergy mechanism is incorporated to concurrently optimize
detection and segmentation, mitigating under-segmentation of microstructures in
UMIS. Extensive evaluations across five clinical datasets reveal Mamba Snake's
superior performance, with an average Dice improvement of 3\% over
state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在MEAD和HDTF基准测试中达到最优性能，并展示了零样本生成能力。

Conclusion: Think-Before-Draw框架显著提升了情感说话头生成的自然性和表现力。

Abstract: Emotional talking-head generation has emerged as a pivotal research area at
the intersection of computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence,
with its core value lying in enhancing human-computer interaction through
immersive and empathetic engagement.With the advancement of multimodal large
language models, the driving signals for emotional talking-head generation has
shifted from audio and video to more flexible text. However, current
text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts,
oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus
failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the
Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth
semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought
(CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded
facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level
semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness
optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive
guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a "global emotion
localization--local muscle control" mechanism to refine micro-expression
dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD
and HDTF. Additionally, we collected a set of portrait images to evaluate our
model's zero-shot generation capability.

Abstract: Reliable anticipation of traffic accidents is essential for advancing
autonomous driving systems. However, this objective is limited by two
fundamental challenges: the scarcity of diverse, high-quality training data and
the frequent absence of crucial object-level cues due to environmental
disruptions or sensor deficiencies. To tackle these issues, we propose a
comprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive
temporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that
utilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create
high-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly
enriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we
construct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships
through strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators,
effectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise.
Furthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture
diverse real-world driving risks. Extensive experiments on public and newly
released datasets confirm that our framework enhances both the accuracy and
lead time of accident anticipation, offering a robust solution to current data
and modeling limitations in safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

Conclusion: 系统验证了多无人机协作在海洋跟踪中的可行性，为规模化自主监测奠定基础。

Abstract: This paper introduces an autonomous UAV vision system for continuous,
real-time tracking of marine animals, specifically sharks, in dynamic marine
environments. The system integrates an onboard computer with a stabilised RGB-D
camera and a custom-trained OSTrack pipeline, enabling visual identification
under challenging lighting, occlusion, and sea-state conditions. A key
innovation is the inter-UAV handoff protocol, which enables seamless transfer
of tracking responsibilities between drones, extending operational coverage
beyond single-drone battery limitations. Performance is evaluated on a curated
shark dataset of 5,200 frames, achieving a tracking success rate of 81.9\%
during real-time flight control at 100 Hz, and robustness to occlusion,
illumination variation, and background clutter. We present a seamless UAV
handoff framework, where target transfer is attempted via high-confidence
feature matching, achieving 82.9\% target coverage. These results confirm the
viability of coordinated UAV operations for extended marine tracking and lay
the groundwork for scalable, autonomous monitoring.

Motivation: 解决任务特定人类演示依赖性强、数据获取成本高的问题，提升泛化能力。

Method: 引入ATARA框架加速数据收集，提出AnyPos逆动力学模型解决数据分布不匹配问题，并集成视频条件动作验证模块。

Result: 实验显示AnyPos-ATARA在测试准确率提升51%，下游任务成功率提高30-40%。

Conclusion: 任务无关范式结合ATARA和AnyPos显著提升了模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise on task-conditioned
control in complex settings such as bimanual manipulation. However, the heavy
reliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and
incurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of
task-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from
task-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this
paradigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety
risks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a
scalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $
30\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective
learning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution
mismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics
model equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder
(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module
to verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation
tasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%
improvement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in
downstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using
replay-based video validation. Project Page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ReToM的局部代表令牌合并策略，用于提升Stable Diffusion模型的效率，同时保持图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Stable Diffusion模型中注意力操作的高计算复杂度问题，现有令牌合并方法未充分考虑图像生成模型的特点。

Method: 定义局部边界为注意力输入中的窗口，调整窗口大小，并通过计算相似度选择每个窗口中最具代表性的令牌进行合并。

Result: 实验显示ReToM在FID上提升6.2%，CLIP分数更高，推理时间相近。

Conclusion: ReToM有效平衡了视觉质量和计算效率。

Abstract: Stable diffusion is an outstanding image generation model for text-to-image,
but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the
quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods
improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention
operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image
generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose
local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging
strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge
tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries
as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we
introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative
token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting
the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most
salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental
results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP
scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time.
We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality
and computational efficiency.

Result: KCR-Transformer在减少FLOPs的同时保持或提高预测精度。

Conclusion: KCR-Transformer在多种视觉任务中表现优异，优于原始模型。

Abstract: Self-attention and transformer architectures have become foundational
components in modern deep learning. Recent efforts have integrated transformer
blocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision, giving rise to
various efficient vision transformers. In this work, we introduce Transformer
with Kernel Complexity Reduction, or KCR-Transformer, a compact transformer
block equipped with differentiable channel selection, guided by a novel and
sharp theoretical generalization bound. KCR-Transformer performs input/output
channel selection in the MLP layers of transformer blocks to reduce the
computational cost. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis
establishing a tight generalization bound for networks equipped with
KCR-Transformer blocks. Leveraging such strong theoretical results, the channel
pruning by KCR-Transformer is conducted in a generalization-aware manner,
ensuring that the resulting network retains a provably small generalization
error. Our KCR-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact
transformer networks, such as ViT and Swin, and it reduces the FLOPs of the
vision transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction
accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in the
vision transformers with KCR-Transformer blocks, leading to KCR-Transformer
networks with different backbones. The resulting TCR-Transformers achieve
superior performance on various computer vision tasks, achieving even better
performance than the original models with even less FLOPs and parameters.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SVM-City的多域感知户外场景理解数据集和City-VLM模型，解决了现有LVLMs在户外场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）主要针对室内场景，难以处理户外大规模、多视角和多模态的场景理解问题。

Method: 构建了SVM-City数据集，包含多尺度、多视角和多模态数据，并设计了City-VLM模型，通过联合概率分布空间实现多模态融合。

Result: City-VLM在问答任务中平均性能提升18.14%，展示了在多种户外场景中的实用性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: SVM-City和City-VLM为户外场景理解提供了有效解决方案，填补了现有技术的空白。

Abstract: Scene understanding enables intelligent agents to interpret and comprehend
their environment. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face
two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene
understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale
environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g.,
bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze
single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid
viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception
outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual
information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first
multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named
\textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale
scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and
multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k
images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from
vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To
effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we
introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding
and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is
realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than
implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation).
Experimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show
City-VLM achieves $18.14 \%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in
question-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and
generalization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.

Result: 实验表明DeQA-Doc在多种退化类型下显著优于现有方法，提供准确且通用的文档质量评估。

Conclusion: DeQA-Doc为文档质量评估提供了高效解决方案，代码和模型权重已开源。

Abstract: Document quality assessment is critical for a wide range of applications
including document digitization, OCR, and archival. However, existing
approaches often struggle to provide accurate and robust quality scores,
limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. With the rapid progress in
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), recent MLLM-based methods have
achieved remarkable performance in image quality assessment. In this work, we
extend this success to the document domain by adapting DeQA-Score, a
state-of-the-art MLLM-based image quality scorer, for document quality
assessment. We propose DeQA-Doc, a framework that leverages the visual language
capabilities of MLLMs and a soft label strategy to regress continuous document
quality scores. To adapt DeQA-Score to DeQA-Doc, we adopt two complementary
solutions to construct soft labels without the variance information. Also, we
relax the resolution constrains to support the large resolution of document
images. Finally, we introduce ensemble methods to further enhance the
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeQA-Doc significantly
outperforms existing baselines, offering accurate and generalizable document
quality assessment across diverse degradation types. Codes and model weights

Motivation: 长尾场景中类别样本数量的不平衡导致低频类别性能下降，预训练模型具有通用表示能力，但现有方法忽视文本编码器的语义信息。

Method: 提出Sage方法，通过SG-Adapter将类别描述作为语义引导，结合注意力机制增强视觉与文本模态的对齐，并设计分布不匹配感知补偿因子纠正预测偏差。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，Sage能有效提升长尾学习性能。

Conclusion: Sage通过语义引导和分布补偿因子，显著改善了长尾视觉识别的性能。

Abstract: The variance in class-wise sample sizes within long-tailed scenarios often
results in degraded performance in less frequent classes. Fortunately,
foundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong
potential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which
promotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in
long-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual
encoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder,
overlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we
propose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for
long-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance
derived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process.
Specifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as
semantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder. The
introduced guidance is passesed through the attention mechanism and enables the
model to focus more on semantically relevant content, strengthening the
alignment between the visual and textual modalities. Due to the inconsistent
class-conditional distributions neglected by the existing loss function, the
resulting prediction bias causes performance improvements for the tail class
less than for the head class, even when the multi-modal alignment is enhanced.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel distribution mismatch-aware
compensation factor, which is specifically designed to rectify the prediction
bias caused by the ignored inconsistent distribution based on our theoretical
analysis, and is seamlessly integrated into the loss function. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
Sage in enhancing performance in long-tailed learning.

Result: 在SUTD-TrafficQA数据集上，FIQ表现优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FIQ通过增强对视频基础内容的理解，提升了模型的泛化能力和推理能力。

Abstract: Video question answering (VQA) is a multimodal task that requires the
interpretation of a video to answer a given question. Existing VQA methods
primarily utilize question and answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal
characteristics of video content. However, these annotations are typically
event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each
video. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts,
and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented
scene representation. This issue limits the model's capacity for generalization
and higher-level reasoning. In this paper, we propose a fundamental question
generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question
answering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability
of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ
generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the
training data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&A pairs enable
the model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced
generalizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign
module that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features,
ensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the
adaptability of downstream tasks. Experiments on SUTD-TrafficQA demonstrate
that our FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
baseline methods.

TL;DR: MCoT-RE是一种无需训练的零样本CIR框架，通过多角度思维链和重排序，平衡文本修改和视觉上下文，显著提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本CIR方法存在信息丢失和跨模态交互不足的问题，MCoT-RE旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: 利用多角度思维链生成两个不同的描述，结合参考图像进行多粒度重排序，实现精确检索。

Result: 在FashionIQ和CIRR数据集上，Recall@10和Recall@1分别提升6.24%和8.58%。

Conclusion: MCoT-RE在无需训练的方法中达到最优性能，有效平衡文本修改和视觉上下文。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image from
a gallery using a composed query consisting of a reference image and a
modification text. Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot
methods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable
limitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality
independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal
interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text,
without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference
image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with
re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes
multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit
modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one
focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual
context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we
combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained
re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning
with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context
of the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves
state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of
up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.

TL;DR: FAR-Net提出了一种多阶段融合框架，通过增强语义对齐和自适应协调模块，解决了现有方法在图像检索任务中的不足，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在图像检索任务中，早期融合过于关注文本细节而忽视视觉上下文，晚期融合难以捕捉图像区域与文本标记的细粒度语义对齐。

Method: FAR-Net采用多阶段融合框架，包括增强语义对齐模块（ESAM）和自适应协调模块（ARM），分别通过晚期融合和早期融合优化语义对齐与鲁棒性。

Result: 在CIRR和FashionIQ数据集上，FAR-Net显著提升了性能，Recall@1和Recall@50分别提高了2.4%和1.04%。

Conclusion: FAR-Net为图像检索任务提供了鲁棒且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) is a vision language task that retrieves a
target image using a reference image and modification text, enabling intuitive
specification of desired changes. While effectively fusing visual and textual
modalities is crucial, existing methods typically adopt either early or late
fusion. Early fusion tends to excessively focus on explicitly mentioned textual
details and neglect visual context, whereas late fusion struggles to capture
fine-grained semantic alignments between image regions and textual tokens. To
address these issues, we propose FAR-Net, a multi-stage fusion framework
designed with enhanced semantic alignment and adaptive reconciliation,
integrating two complementary modules. The enhanced semantic alignment module
(ESAM) employs late fusion with cross-attention to capture fine-grained
semantic relationships, while the adaptive reconciliation module (ARM) applies
early fusion with uncertainty embeddings to enhance robustness and
adaptability. Experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show consistent performance
gains, improving Recall@1 by up to 2.4% and Recall@50 by 1.04% over existing
state-of-the-art methods, empirically demonstrating that FAR Net provides a
robust and scalable solution to CIR tasks.

Conclusion: DINO-VO在鲁棒性、泛化性和效率上均显著提升，适用于多种场景，包括户外驾驶。

Abstract: Learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) poses robustness,
generalization, and efficiency challenges in robotics. Recent advances in
visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and
generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains
limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a
feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its
sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a
salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore,
we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric
features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a
transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable
precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior
detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater
robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy
and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone
DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on
the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while
running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single
GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor
driving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities.

development of technology, the need for accurate classification of food images
has grown, which is crucial for a variety of application scenarios. However,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的视觉语言导航方法受限于固定知识库和推理能力，无法有效融入经验知识，缺乏进化能力。

Method: SE-VLN包含三个核心模块：分层记忆模块（存储成功与失败案例）、检索增强推理模块（多步决策）和反思模块（持续进化）。

Result: 在未见环境中，SE-VLN的导航成功率分别达到57%和35.2%，比现有最优方法提升了23.9%和15.0%。

Conclusion: SE-VLN展示了作为自进化框架的巨大潜力，其性能随经验库增长而提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to
emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent
generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning.
However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning
abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and
thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this,
we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and
proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the
ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it
was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework
was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a
hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into
reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to
retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection
module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the
SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen
environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0%
over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets,
respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with
increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a
self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

Abstract: Small Multi-Object Tracking (SMOT) is particularly challenging when targets
occupy only a few dozen pixels, rendering detection and appearance-based
association unreliable. Building on the success of the MVA2023 SOD4SB
challenge, this paper introduces the SMOT4SB challenge, which leverages
temporal information to address limitations of single-frame detection. Our
three main contributions are: (1) the SMOT4SB dataset, consisting of 211 UAV
video sequences with 108,192 annotated frames under diverse real-world
conditions, designed to capture motion entanglement where both camera and
targets move freely in 3D; (2) SO-HOTA, a novel metric combining Dot Distance
with HOTA to mitigate the sensitivity of IoU-based metrics to small
displacements; and (3) a competitive MVA2025 challenge with 78 participants and
308 submissions, where the winning method achieved a 5.1x improvement over the
baseline. This work lays a foundation for advancing SMOT in UAV scenarios with
applications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 追求一种无需数据集特定微调即可适应不同分辨率和视差范围的通用立体匹配模型，揭示了局部搜索方法与全局匹配架构之间的固有矛盾。

Method: 设计了一种多分辨率变换器用于长距离对应，结合新型损失函数集中概率于可行匹配，实现了视差、遮挡和置信度的联合估计。

Result: $S^2M^2$在Middlebury v3和ETH3D基准测试中达到最新技术水平，显著优于先前方法，同时保持高效性。

Conclusion: $S^2M^2$通过全局匹配架构实现了高精度与高效率的平衡，为立体匹配领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing
across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific
fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search
methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism
inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On
the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust,
have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and
memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching
architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency
without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design
integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence,
trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible
matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity,
occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the
Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods
across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive
efficiency.

Conclusion: AnyCap项目通过模型、数据集和评估基准的集成，有效提升了可控描述的质量和评估可靠性。

Abstract: Controllable captioning is essential for precise multimodal alignment and
instruction following, yet existing models often lack fine-grained control and
reliable evaluation protocols. To address this gap, we present the AnyCap
Project, an integrated solution spanning model, dataset, and evaluation. We
introduce AnyCapModel (ACM), a lightweight plug-and-play framework that
enhances the controllability of existing foundation models for omni-modal
captioning without retraining the base model. ACM reuses the original captions
from base models while incorporating user instructions and modality features to
generate improved captions. To remedy the data scarcity in controllable
multimodal captioning, we build AnyCapDataset (ACD), covering three modalities,
28 user-instruction types, and 300\,k high-quality data entries. We further
propose AnyCapEval, a new benchmark that provides more reliable evaluation
metrics for controllable captioning by decoupling content accuracy and
stylistic fidelity. ACM markedly improves caption quality across a diverse set
of base models on AnyCapEval. Notably, ACM-8B raises GPT-4o\'s content scores
by 45\% and style scores by 12\%, and it also achieves substantial gains on
widely used benchmarks such as MIA-Bench and VidCapBench.

Motivation: 解决传统流匹配和扩散策略在视觉到动作生成中需要额外条件机制（如交叉注意力）带来的时间和空间开销问题。

Method: 提出将潜在图像作为流源，学习从视觉到动作的内在映射，通过结构化动作潜在空间和上采样动作数据解决模态差异问题。

Result: 在ALOHA平台的复杂双手机器人任务中，VITA性能优于或匹配现有生成策略，并将推理延迟降低50-130%。

Conclusion: VITA是首个仅使用MLP的流匹配策略，能够解决复杂双手机器人任务，展示了其高效性和简单性。

Abstract: We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent
visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional
flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions
(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like
cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating
time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent
images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action
while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative
modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different
modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data
lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional
visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a
structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,
up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we
supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs
through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss
through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end
learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging
bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and
2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency
by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different
conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the
first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual
manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.

image captioning plays a significant role in interpreting vast and complex

Result: 实验表明，SRE在多个数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SRE通过注意力重聚焦和集成学习有效提升了领域泛化性能。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model from source domains and
apply it to unseen target domains with out-of-distribution data. Owing to
CLIP's strong ability to encode semantic concepts, it has attracted increasing
interest in domain generalization. However, CLIP often struggles to focus on
task-relevant regions across domains, i.e., domain-invariant regions, resulting
in suboptimal performance on unseen target domains. To address this challenge,
we propose an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and
Ensemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the
attention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain
shifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated
target domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the
attention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE
utilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant
attention maps between the source data and the simulated target data. Extensive
experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that SRE generally
achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods. The code is available

Abstract: Most existing remote sensing instance segmentation approaches are designed
for close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel
categories or generalize across datasets. This restricts their applicability in
diverse Earth observation scenarios. To address this, we introduce
open-vocabulary (OV) learning for remote sensing instance segmentation. While
current OV segmentation models perform well on natural image datasets, their
direct application to remote sensing faces challenges such as diverse
landscapes, seasonal variations, and the presence of small or ambiguous objects
in aerial imagery. To overcome these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SCORE}$
($\textbf{S}$cene $\textbf{C}$ontext matters in $\textbf{O}$pen-vocabulary
$\textbf{RE}$mote sensing instance segmentation), a framework that integrates
multi-granularity scene context, i.e., regional context and global context, to
enhance both visual and textual representations. Specifically, we introduce
Region-Aware Integration, which refines class embeddings with regional context
to improve object distinguishability. Additionally, we propose Global Context
Adaptation, which enriches naive text embeddings with remote sensing global
context, creating a more adaptable and expressive linguistic latent space for
the classifier. We establish new benchmarks for OV remote sensing instance
segmentation across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that,
our proposed method achieves SOTA performance, which provides a robust solution
for large-scale, real-world geospatial analysis. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法在推理分割任务中因视觉编码器预训练分辨率低而受限，且简单插值位置嵌入效果有限且计算成本高。

Method: 提出HRSeg模型，包含HRP模块（通过裁剪处理高分辨率图像，整合局部和全局特征）和HRE模块（通过高分辨率图像增强掩码特征，优化与文本特征的对齐）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验验证了HRSeg的优越性能。

Conclusion: HRSeg通过高效的高分辨率细粒度感知，显著提升了推理分割任务的性能。

Abstract: The reasoning segmentation task involves segmenting objects within an image
by interpreting implicit user instructions, which may encompass subtleties such
as contextual cues and open-world knowledge. Despite significant advancements
made by existing approaches, they remain constrained by low perceptual
resolution, as visual encoders are typically pre-trained at lower resolutions.
Furthermore, simply interpolating the positional embeddings of visual encoders
to enhance perceptual resolution yields only marginal performance improvements
while incurring substantial computational costs. To address this, we propose
HRSeg, an efficient model with high-resolution fine-grained perception. It
features two key innovations: High-Resolution Perception (HRP) and
High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE). The HRP module processes high-resolution
images through cropping, integrating local and global features for
multi-granularity quality. The HRE module enhances mask features by integrating
fine-grained information from high-resolution images, refining their alignment
with text features for precise segmentation. Extensive ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of our modules, while comprehensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate HRSeg's superior performance.

Result: 在7名参与者中，NeckSense的平均顶点误差为25.9毫米，性能与先进视觉方法相当。

Conclusion: NeckSense展示了生物阻抗可穿戴设备在头部跟踪中的潜力，为未来应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: We present NeckSense, a novel wearable system for head pose tracking that
leverages multi-channel bio-impedance sensing with soft, dry electrodes
embedded in a lightweight, necklace-style form factor. NeckSense captures
dynamic changes in tissue impedance around the neck, which are modulated by
head rotations and subtle muscle activations. To robustly estimate head pose,
we propose a deep learning framework that integrates anatomical priors,
including joint constraints and natural head rotation ranges, into the loss
function design. We validate NeckSense on 7 participants using the current SOTA
pose estimation model as ground truth. Our system achieves a mean per-vertex
error of 25.9 mm across various head movements with a leave-one-person-out
cross-validation method, demonstrating that a compact, line-of-sight-free
bio-impedance wearable can deliver head-tracking performance comparable to SOTA
vision-based methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于摄像头的情感识别方法，结合注视模式与环境语义及时间动态，实现无用户察觉的实时情感识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感识别方法依赖显性信号（如面部表情、语音或手势），忽略环境背景，且生理信号方法复杂且不自然。

Method: 利用标准高清摄像头捕捉用户眼部外观和头部运动，估计注视轨迹，建模注视行为的空间、语义和时间维度。

Result: 揭示了情感是人与环境互动的复杂结果，而非单纯的生理反应，实现了高通用性和低部署成本。

Conclusion: 该方法为无用户察觉、实时且连续的情感识别提供了新途径。

Abstract: Emotion recognition,as a step toward mind reading,seeks to infer internal
states from external cues.Most existing methods rely on explicit signals-such
as facial expressions,speech,or gestures-that reflect only bodily responses and
overlook the influence of environmental context.These cues are often
voluntary,easy to mask,and insufficient for capturing deeper,implicit emotions.
Physiological signal-based approaches offer more direct access to internal
states but require complex sensors that compromise natural behavior and limit
scalability.Gaze-based methods typically rely on static fixation analysis and
fail to capture the rich,dynamic interactions between gaze and the
environment,and thus cannot uncover the deep connection between emotion and
implicit behavior.To address these limitations,we propose a novel
camera-based,user-unaware emotion recognition approach that integrates gaze
fixation patterns with environmental semantics and temporal dynamics.Leveraging
standard HD cameras,our method unobtrusively captures users'eye appearance and
head movements in natural settings-without the need for specialized hardware or
active user participation.From these visual cues,the system estimates gaze
trajectories over time and space, providing the basis for modeling the spatial,
semantic,and temporal dimensions of gaze behavior. This allows us to capture
the dynamic interplay between visual attention and the surrounding
environment,revealing that emotions are not merely physiological responses but
complex outcomes of human-environment interactions.The proposed approach
enables user-unaware,real-time,and continuous emotion recognition,offering high
generalizability and low deployment cost.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的车道性能估计框架（LanePerf），通过整合图像和车道特征，解决了车道检测中模型性能估计的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车道检测在ADAS和ADS中至关重要，但域偏移会影响模型可靠性。传统方法需要大量标注数据，而本文探索了无需真实标签的性能估计方法。

Method: 论文首先将五种图像分类的性能估计方法适配到车道检测任务中，然后提出LanePerf框架，结合预训练图像编码器和DeepSets架构。

Result: 在OpenLane数据集上的实验表明，LanePerf优于基线方法，MAE为0.117，Spearman相关系数为0.727。

Conclusion: LanePerf为ADAS提供了高效的无标签性能估计方法，提升了在复杂驾驶场景中的测试效率和安全性。

Abstract: Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems
(ADAS) and Automated Driving System (ADS), providing essential spatial
information for lateral control. However, domain shifts often undermine model
reliability when deployed in new environments. Ensuring the robustness and
safety of lane detection models typically requires collecting and annotating
target domain data, which is resource-intensive. Estimating model performance
without ground-truth labels offers a promising alternative for efficient
robustness assessment, yet remains underexplored in lane detection. While
previous work has addressed performance estimation in image classification,
these methods are not directly applicable to lane detection tasks. This paper
first adapts five well-performing performance estimation methods from image
classification to lane detection, building a baseline. Addressing the
limitations of prior approaches that solely rely on softmax scores or lane
features, we further propose a new Lane Performance Estimation Framework
(LanePerf), which integrates image and lane features using a pretrained image
encoder and a DeepSets-based architecture, effectively handling zero-lane
detection scenarios and large domain-shift cases. Extensive experiments on the
OpenLane dataset, covering diverse domain shifts (scenes, weather, hours),
demonstrate that our LanePerf outperforms all baselines, achieving a lower MAE
of 0.117 and a higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.727. These
findings pave the way for robust, label-free performance estimation in ADAS,
supporting more efficient testing and improved safety in challenging driving
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D点云重建方法存在信息丢失问题，如纹理缺失平面或复杂结构物体的细节失真，而多视角图像能提供更详细的场景表示。

Method: 提出Argus框架，融合多视角图像和相机姿态生成场景特征，与3D特征交互，形成全面的3D感知场景嵌入。

Result: 实验表明，Argus在多种下游任务中优于现有3D-LMMs。

Conclusion: Argus通过多模态输入扩展了LLMs的3D任务能力，有效弥补了3D点云重建的不足。

Abstract: Advancements in foundation models have made it possible to conduct
applications in various downstream tasks. Especially, the new era has witnessed
a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling
tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point
clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results
in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone
to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds.
Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of
details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense
reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency
with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene
components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on
these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that
leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In
general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model
(3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D
multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to
tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and
camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features
to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach
compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and
helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks.

Result: 实验证明Fed-Cyclic和Fed-Star在新数据集上表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 新数据集和算法为联邦学习提供了更高效和隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning is a collaborative machine learning paradigm that enables
multiple clients to learn a global model without exposing their data to each
other. Consequently, it provides a secure learning platform with
privacy-preserving capabilities. This paper introduces a new dataset containing
23,326 images collected from eight different commercial sources and classified
into 31 categories, similar to the Office-31 dataset. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first image classification dataset specifically designed
for Federated Learning. We also propose two new Federated Learning algorithms,
namely Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star. In Fed-Cyclic, a client receives weights from
its previous client, updates them through local training, and passes them to
the next client, thus forming a cyclic topology. In Fed-Star, a client receives
weights from all other clients, updates its local weights through
pre-aggregation (to address statistical heterogeneity) and local training, and
sends its updated local weights to all other clients, thus forming a star-like
topology. Our experiments reveal that both algorithms perform better than
existing baselines on our newly introduced dataset.

Motivation: 解决运动分析中缺乏真实运动数据和可靠性不明确的问题。

Result: 模型在真实运动数据上表现显著优于基线，MPJPE降低75%。

Conclusion: 真实运动数据对模型性能至关重要，但模型在高速运动指标上仍有局限。

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimation is a promising, flexible alternative to costly
motion capture systems for sports analysis. However, its practical application
is hindered by two factors: a lack of realistic sports datasets and unclear
reliability for sports tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce the
AthleticsPose dataset, a new public dataset featuring ``real'' motions captured
from 23 athletes performing various athletics events on an athletic field.
Using this dataset, we trained a representative 3D pose estimation model and
performed a comprehensive evaluation. Our results show that the model trained
on AthleticsPose significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on an
imitated sports motion dataset, reducing MPJPE by approximately 75 %. These
results show the importance of training on authentic sports motion data, as
models based on imitated motions do not effectively transfer to real-world
motions. Further analysis reveals that estimation accuracy is sensitive to
camera view and subject scale. In case studies of kinematic indicators, the
model demonstrated the potential to capture individual differences in knee
angles but struggled with higher-speed metrics, such as knee-drive velocity,
due to prediction biases. This work provides the research community with a
valuable dataset and clarifies the potential and practical limitations of using
monocular 3D pose estimation for sports motion analysis. Our dataset, code, and
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/SZucchini/AthleticsPose.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）通常使用过多视觉令牌，而实际场景中多数任务无需高分辨率。

Method: 采用动态分辨率处理，结合强化学习和LLM-as-Judge策略，智能决定是否需要高分辨率图像。

Result: 在OCR任务中表现优异，同时在简单任务中大幅节省视觉令牌。

Conclusion: VisionThink在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved
performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often
significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world
scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the
performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models
still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4
resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with
different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,
namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides
whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output
a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing
Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or
thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by
case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding
capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens
on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge
strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully
design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and
reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available

Conclusion: DMQ有效解决了扩散模型量化中的关键问题，提升了性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative
nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,
leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a
DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise
Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned
Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute
quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall
quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having
small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error
accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to
prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that
layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we
introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust
selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting
algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths
such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image
generation quality and model stability. The code is available at

Method: 采用细粒度识别策略，融合患者元数据与X射线图像，并使用细粒度数据集预训练权重。

Result: 细粒度策略和元数据融合使诊断准确率在小数据集上提升2%，在大骨折数据集上提升超过10%。

Conclusion: 该方法在有限数据集下显著提高了手腕病理诊断的准确性，为医学影像分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who
constitute the majority of fracture cases. However, diagnosing these conditions
is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. Computer vision presents
a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a
notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one
modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse
and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to
address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely
limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained
recognition task, aiming to identify subtle X-ray pathologies that conventional
CNNs overlook. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient
metadata with X-ray images. Thirdly, rather than pre-training on a
coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet, we utilize weights trained on a
fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical
domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies. Our results show
that a fine-grained strategy and metadata integration improve diagnostic
accuracy by 2% with a limited dataset and by over 10% with a larger
fracture-focused dataset.

Abstract: To reduce the reliance of visible-infrared person re-identification (ReID)
models on labeled cross-modal samples, this paper explores a weakly supervised
cross-modal person ReID method that uses only single-modal sample identity
labels, addressing scenarios where cross-modal identity labels are unavailable.
To mitigate the impact of missing cross-modal labels on model performance, we
propose a heterogeneous expert collaborative consistency learning framework,
designed to establish robust cross-modal identity correspondences in a weakly
supervised manner. This framework leverages labeled data from each modality to
independently train dedicated classification experts. To associate cross-modal
samples, these classification experts act as heterogeneous predictors,
predicting the identities of samples from the other modality. To improve
prediction accuracy, we design a cross-modal relationship fusion mechanism that
effectively integrates predictions from different experts. Under the implicit
supervision provided by cross-modal identity correspondences, collaborative and
consistent learning among the experts is encouraged, significantly enhancing
the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features and improve
cross-modal identity recognition. Experimental results on two challenging
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: MUPM通过量化不确定性关系，为临床应用提供了高效且实用的工具，尤其在数据冗余识别和不确定性估计方面表现突出。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can process and integrate
information from multimodality sources, such as text and images. However,
interrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual
uni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an
uncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of
large-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty
propagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the
relationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and
joint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting
of cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be
optimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are
generalisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps
surprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be
explained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,
along with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this
learned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these
uncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may
be estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of
cardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the
efficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty
and its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered
practical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are
available at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.

Conclusion: LoViC框架成功解决了扩散变换器在长视频生成中的扩展性问题，通过FlexFormer的统一潜在表示和分段生成策略，实现了在保持时间连贯性的同时生成长时间视频内容

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) for text-to-video
generation, scaling to long-duration content remains challenging due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. While prior efforts -- such as sparse
attention and temporally autoregressive models -- offer partial relief, they
often compromise temporal coherence or scalability. We introduce LoViC, a
DiT-based framework trained on million-scale open-domain videos, designed to
produce long, coherent videos through a segment-wise generation process. At the
core of our approach is FlexFormer, an expressive autoencoder that jointly
compresses video and text into unified latent representations. It supports
variable-length inputs with linearly adjustable compression rates, enabled by a
single query token design based on the Q-Former architecture. Additionally, by
encoding temporal context through position-aware mechanisms, our model
seamlessly supports prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot
generation within a unified paradigm. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.

Motivation: 传统DIR方法在调整正则化参数时需要多次训练，计算成本高。cIDIR旨在通过条件化超参数分布，简化这一过程。

Method: cIDIR利用INRs建模连续可微的变形向量场（DVF），并通过分割掩码优化正则化超参数。

Result: 在DIR-LAB数据集上，cIDIR表现出高精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: cIDIR提供了一种高效且灵活的正则化参数优化方法，适用于DIR任务。

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deformable image registration (DIR) to ensure
that the estimated Deformation Vector Field (DVF) remains smooth, physically
plausible, and anatomically consistent. However, fine-tuning regularization
parameters in learning-based DIR frameworks is computationally expensive, often
requiring multiple training iterations. To address this, we propose cIDI, a
novel DIR framework based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that
conditions the registration process on regularization hyperparameters. Unlike
conventional methods that require retraining for each regularization
hyperparameter setting, cIDIR is trained over a prior distribution of these
hyperparameters, then optimized over the regularization hyperparameters by
using the segmentations masks as an observation. Additionally, cIDIR models a
continuous and differentiable DVF, enabling seamless integration of advanced
regularization techniques via automatic differentiation. Evaluated on the
DIR-LAB dataset, $\operatorname{cIDIR}$ achieves high accuracy and robustness
across the dataset.

Abstract: Existing world models for autonomous driving struggle with long-horizon
generation and generalization to challenging scenarios. In this work, we
develop a model using simple design choices, and without additional supervision
or sensors, such as maps, depth, or multiple cameras. We show that our model
yields state-of-the-art performance, despite having only 469M parameters and
being trained on 280h of video data. It particularly stands out in difficult
scenarios like turning maneuvers and urban traffic. We test whether discrete
token models possibly have advantages over continuous models based on flow
matching. To this end, we set up a hybrid tokenizer that is compatible with
both approaches and allows for a side-by-side comparison. Our study concludes
in favor of the continuous autoregressive model, which is less brittle on
individual design choices and more powerful than the model built on discrete
tokens. Code, models and qualitative results are publicly available at

*Qiang Wang,Mengchao Wang,Fan Jiang,Yaqi Fan,Yonggang Qi,Mu Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FantasyPortrait是一个基于扩散变换器的框架，用于生成高质量、情感丰富的单人和多人面部动画，解决了现有方法在跨重演和多角色控制中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式几何先验，容易产生伪影且难以捕捉细微情感，同时缺乏对多角色动画的支持。

Method: 采用扩散变换器框架，引入表达式增强学习策略和掩码交叉注意力机制，以隐式表示捕捉面部动态并防止特征干扰。

Result: 在定量和定性评估中显著优于现有方法，尤其在跨重演和多角色场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: FantasyPortrait通过创新方法解决了现有挑战，并提供了专门的数据集和基准，推动了该领域的研究。

Abstract: Producing expressive facial animations from static images is a challenging
task. Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial
landmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and
struggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack
support for multi-character animation, as driving features from different
individuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To
address these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer
based framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations
for both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an
expression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations
to capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to
render fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked
cross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression
generation, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in
this area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are
specifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating
multi-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in
challenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts. Our project page is

Conclusion: 生成式AI在解决DNN训练数据不足方面具有潜力，但也存在局限性。

Abstract: While recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) have substantially
enhanced visual AI's capabilities, the challenge of inadequate data diversity
and volume remains, particularly in construction domain. This study presents a
novel image synthesis methodology tailored for construction worker detection,
leveraging the generative-AI platform Midjourney. The approach entails
generating a collection of 12,000 synthetic images by formulating 3000
different prompts, with an emphasis on image realism and diversity. These
images, after manual labeling, serve as a dataset for DNN training. Evaluation
on a real construction image dataset yielded promising results, with the model
attaining average precisions (APs) of 0.937 and 0.642 at
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds of 0.5 and 0.5 to 0.95, respectively.
Notably, the model demonstrated near-perfect performance on the synthetic
dataset, achieving APs of 0.994 and 0.919 at the two mentioned thresholds.
These findings reveal both the potential and weakness of generative AI in
addressing DNN training data scarcity.

### [61] [RGB Pre-Training Enhanced Unobservable Feature Latent Diffusion Model for Spectral Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12967)
*Keli Deng,Jie Nie,Yuntao Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于RGB预训练潜在扩散模型（RGB-LDM）的两阶段方法，用于从RGB图像重建高光谱图像（HSI），通过分离不可观测特征并学习其联合分布，实现了优异的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像重建（SR）的关键挑战在于从RGB图像中估计不可观测的光谱特征，这些特征包含RGB传感器未捕获的重要光谱信息。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1）通过光谱不可观测特征自编码器（SpeUAE）学习光谱结构；2）利用RGB-LDM和空间自编码器（SpaAE）学习光谱-空间联合分布，形成不可观测特征LDM（ULDM）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在高光谱图像重建和下游重光照任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过分离不可观测特征并利用RGB预训练模型的空间知识，该方法有效解决了高光谱图像重建问题。

Abstract: Spectral reconstruction (SR) is a crucial problem in image processing that
requires reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from the corresponding RGB
images. A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which
encapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging
sensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial
joint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable
feature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding
RGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB
pre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this
end, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an
unobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding
spatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can
focus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable
feature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers
the ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.
Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure
representation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to
transform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral
unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress
the unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the
second stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by
the SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively. The ULDM is then acquired to model the
distribution of the coded unobservable feature with guidance from the
corresponding RGB images. Experimental results on SR and downstream relighting
tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于方差的剪枝方法，用于高效压缩模型，减少计算和内存需求，同时最小化微调需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型模型（如Vision Transformers）的训练成本高昂，现有方法在剪枝后需要大量重新训练以恢复性能，这成为部署的挑战。

Method: 通过收集激活统计信息选择剪枝神经元，并将均值激活重新整合到模型中，以保持性能。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k任务中，剪枝后DeiT-Base模型保留70%性能，仅需10轮微调即可恢复99%准确率，同时减少35%计算量和36%模型大小。

Conclusion: 基于方差的剪枝方法在保持性能的同时显著降低了模型的计算和存储需求，适用于资源受限的硬件。

Abstract: Increasingly expensive training of ever larger models such as Vision
Transfomers motivate reusing the vast library of already trained
state-of-the-art networks. However, their latency, high computational costs and
memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment, especially on
resource-constrained hardware. While structured pruning methods can reduce
these factors, they often require costly retraining, sometimes for up to
hundreds of epochs, or even training from scratch to recover the lost accuracy
resulting from the structural modifications. Maintaining the provided
performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding
extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce
Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for
efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first
gathers activation statistics, which are used to select neurons for pruning.
Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to
preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we
demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its
original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99%
of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model
size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44x.

Result: 在三个基准数据集和多种下游任务上，DISSect表现优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: DISSect通过差分信息有效识别噪声对应，为对比学习提供了高效训练方案。

Abstract: The remarkable success of contrastive-learning-based multimodal models has
been greatly driven by training on ever-larger datasets with expensive compute
consumption. Sample selection as an alternative efficient paradigm plays an
important direction to accelerate the training process. However, recent
advances on sample selection either mostly rely on an oracle model to offline
select a high-quality coreset, which is limited in the cold-start scenarios, or
focus on online selection based on real-time model predictions, which has not
sufficiently or efficiently considered the noisy correspondence. To address
this dilemma, we propose a novel Differential-Informed Sample Selection
(DISSect) method, which accurately and efficiently discriminates the noisy
correspondence for training acceleration. Specifically, we rethink the impact
of noisy correspondence on contrastive learning and propose that the
differential between the predicted correlation of the current model and that of
a historical model is more informative to characterize sample quality. Based on
this, we construct a robust differential-based sample selection and analyze its
theoretical insights. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and
various downstream tasks demonstrate the consistent superiority of DISSect over
current state-of-the-art methods. Source code is available at:

Conclusion: 涂鸦标注作为弱监督信号有效提升了图像篡改定位的性能和效率，动态特征调整和不确定性抑制进一步优化了结果。

Abstract: Deep learning-based image manipulation localization (IML) methods have
achieved remarkable performance in recent years, but typically rely on
large-scale pixel-level annotated datasets. To address the challenge of
acquiring high-quality annotations, some recent weakly supervised methods
utilize image-level labels to segment manipulated regions. However, the
performance is still limited due to insufficient supervision signals. In this
study, we explore a form of weak supervision that improves the annotation
efficiency and detection performance, namely scribble annotation supervision.
We re-annotated mainstream IML datasets with scribble labels and propose the
first scribble-based IML (Sc-IML) dataset. Additionally, we propose the first
scribble-based weakly supervised IML framework. Specifically, we employ
self-supervised training with a structural consistency loss to encourage the
model to produce consistent predictions under multi-scale and augmented inputs.
In addition, we propose a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM) that
adaptively integrates prior information from both manipulated and authentic
regions for dynamic feature adjustment, further enhancing feature
discriminability and prediction consistency in complex scenes. We also propose
a gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM) that utilizes gating mechanisms to
regulate information flow during feature fusion, guiding the model toward
emphasizing potential tampered regions. Finally, we propose a confidence-aware
entropy minimization loss (${\mathcal{L}}_{ {CEM }}$). This loss dynamically
regularizes predictions in weakly annotated or unlabeled regions based on model
uncertainty, effectively suppressing unreliable predictions. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms existing fully supervised approaches
in terms of average performance both in-distribution and out-of-distribution.

Motivation: 传统MAR模型在图像生成中表现不如AR模型，研究旨在改进MAR架构以提升性能。

Method: 评估图像tokenizer，引入双向注意力和2D RoPE，构建MaskGIL模型，参数规模从111M到1.4B。

Result: MaskGIL在ImageNet 256x256基准测试中FID达3.71，仅需8步推理，同时开发了文本驱动的图像生成模型。

Conclusion: MaskGIL不仅提升图像生成效率，还扩展至加速AR生成和实时语音转图像，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have made notable progress in image generation,
with Masked AutoRegressive (MAR) models gaining attention for their efficient
parallel decoding. However, MAR models have traditionally underperformed when
compared to standard AR models. This study refines the MAR architecture to
improve image generation quality. We begin by evaluating various image
tokenizers to identify the most effective one. Subsequently, we introduce an
improved Bidirectional LLaMA architecture by replacing causal attention with
bidirectional attention and incorporating 2D RoPE, which together form our
advanced model, MaskGIL. Scaled from 111M to 1.4B parameters, MaskGIL achieves
a FID score of 3.71, matching state-of-the-art AR models in the ImageNet
256x256 benchmark, while requiring only 8 inference steps compared to the 256
steps of AR models. Furthermore, we develop a text-driven MaskGIL model with
775M parameters for generating images from text at various resolutions. Beyond
image generation, MaskGIL extends to accelerate AR-based generation and enable
real-time speech-to-image conversion. Our codes and models are available at

Conclusion: AOFT通过引入近似正交性，有效提升了微调模型的泛化能力，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: A prevalent approach in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained
Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone
parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to
accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived
through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection
matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we
observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within
any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent
in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality
implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error,
signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the
fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as
the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of
fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an
Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the
low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to
generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the
down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices
with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image
classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization
capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.

Result: 实验表明，HCS在各种任务中表现出卓越的性能和普适性。

Conclusion: HCS是一种即插即用的方法，兼容任何视觉语言模型，显著提升了复杂场景的理解能力。

Abstract: Scene understanding is one of the core tasks in computer vision, aiming to
extract semantic information from images to identify objects, scene categories,
and their interrelationships. Although advancements in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have driven progress in this field, existing VLMs still face challenges
in adaptation to unseen complex wide-area scenes. To address the challenges,
this paper proposes a Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) mechanism to
advance the adaptation of VLMs in complex wide-area scene understanding. It
progressively refines the selected regions based on the proposed theoretically
guaranteed importance function, which considers utility, representativeness,
robustness, and synergy. Without requiring additional fine-tuning, HCS enables
VLMs to achieve rapid understandings of unseen scenes at any scale using
minimal interpretable regions while mitigating insufficient feature density.
HCS is a plug-and-play method that is compatible with any VLM. Experiments
demonstrate that HCS achieves superior performance and universality in various
tasks.

Conclusion: 检测器引导的框架有效提升了数据集蒸馏的质量和性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) aims to generate a compact yet informative dataset
that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset, thereby reducing
demands on storage and computational resources. Although diffusion models have
made significant progress in dataset distillation, the generated surrogate
datasets often contain samples with label inconsistencies or insufficient
structural detail, leading to suboptimal downstream performance. To address
these issues, we propose a detector-guided dataset distillation framework that
explicitly leverages a pre-trained detector to identify and refine anomalous
synthetic samples, thereby ensuring label consistency and improving image
quality. Specifically, a detector model trained on the original dataset is
employed to identify anomalous images exhibiting label mismatches or low
classification confidence. For each defective image, multiple candidates are
generated using a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on the corresponding
image prototype and label. The optimal candidate is then selected by jointly
considering the detector's confidence score and dissimilarity to existing
qualified synthetic samples, thereby ensuring both label accuracy and
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can
synthesize high-quality representative images with richer details, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on the validation set.

Motivation: 在安全关键的机器人应用中，实时准确检测动态对象至关重要。现有方法因使用多个子网络导致计算成本高，影响实时性。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的通道级运动特征表示方法，仅需姿态网络，无需其他子网络，通过提取深度特征和3D运动信息提升效率。

Result: 在KITTI和Cityscapes数据集上，FPS提升约4倍，参数减少至25%，同时保持等效精度。

Conclusion: 该方法在高效性和准确性上均优于现有技术，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: For safety-critical robotics applications such as autonomous driving, it is
important to detect all required objects accurately in real-time. Motion
segmentation offers a solution by identifying dynamic objects from the scene in
a class-agnostic manner. Recently, various motion segmentation models have been
proposed, most of which jointly use subnetworks to estimate Depth, Pose,
Optical Flow, and Scene Flow. As a result, the overall computational cost of
the model increases, hindering real-time performance.
  In this paper, we propose a novel cost-volume-based motion feature
representation, Channel-wise Motion Features. By extracting depth features of
each instance in the feature map and capturing the scene's 3D motion
information, it offers enhanced efficiency. The only subnetwork used to build
Channel-wise Motion Features is the Pose Network, and no others are required.
Our method not only achieves about 4 times the FPS of state-of-the-art models
in the KITTI Dataset and Cityscapes of the VCAS-Motion Dataset, but also
demonstrates equivalent accuracy while reducing the parameters to about 25$\%$.

TL;DR: Decoupled PROB通过ETOP和TDQI解决了PROB模型中对象性和类别预测的冲突，显著提升了开放世界目标检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放世界目标检测（OWOD）需要检测未知对象并逐步学习新类别，但缺乏未知对象的标注数据使其具有挑战性。现有方法如PROB虽无需伪标签，但存在对象性与类别预测的冲突。

Method: 提出Decoupled PROB，引入ETOP终止对象性预测，解决冲突；采用TDQI高效提取已知和未知对象的特征。

Result: 在OWOD基准测试中，Decoupled PROB在多个指标上超越现有方法，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: Decoupled PROB通过解耦对象性和类别预测，为OWOD任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a challenging computer vision task that
extends standard object detection by (1) detecting and classifying unknown
objects without supervision, and (2) incrementally learning new object classes
without forgetting previously learned ones. The absence of ground truths for
unknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have
addressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently
proposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB)
is a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown
objects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces
issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions.
  To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel
model, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of
Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate
layers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and
objectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query
Initialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown
objects, thereby improving performance. TDQI is a query initialization method
that combines query selection and learnable queries, and it is a module that
can be easily integrated into existing DETR-based OWOD models. Extensive
experiments on OWOD benchmarks demonstrate that Decoupled PROB surpasses all
existing methods across several metrics, significantly improving performance.

Motivation: 医学图像分割中注释变异性问题严重，传统深度学习方法无法捕捉注释者偏差，现有多注释方法视角单一。

Method: 两阶段扩散框架：第一阶段通过概率共识策略建立群体共识，第二阶段通过自适应提示捕获专家偏好。

Result: 在两个公开数据集（LIDC-IDRI和NPC-170）上表现优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: DiffOSeg成功解决了共识与偏好驱动的分割问题，代码开源。

Abstract: Annotation variability remains a substantial challenge in medical image
segmentation, stemming from ambiguous imaging boundaries and diverse clinical
expertise. Traditional deep learning methods producing single deterministic
segmentation predictions often fail to capture these annotator biases. Although
recent studies have explored multi-rater segmentation, existing methods
typically focus on a single perspective -- either generating a probabilistic
``gold standard'' consensus or preserving expert-specific preferences -- thus
struggling to provide a more omni view. In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a
two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both
consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven
(reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes
population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II
captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. Demonstrated on two
public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), our model outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics. Source code is available

Abstract: The reasoning-based pose estimation (RPE) benchmark has emerged as a widely
adopted evaluation standard for pose-aware multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Despite its significance, we identified critical reproducibility and
benchmark-quality issues that hinder fair and consistent quantitative
evaluations. Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from
those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and
error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT)
annotations for quantitative metrics (\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our
analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including
significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and
ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations
across diverse scenarios. To alleviate manual effort and enhance
reproducibility, we carefully refined the GT annotations through meticulous
visual matching and publicly release these refined annotations as an
open-source resource, thereby promoting consistent quantitative evaluations and
facilitating future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: GLAD是一种简单通用的框架，显著提升了预训练模型在少样本任务中的性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, show impressive zero-shot
recognition ability and can be easily transferred to specific downstream tasks
via prompt tuning, even with limited training data. However, existing prompt
tuning methods face two main challenges: (1) In few-shot scenarios, data
scarcity often leads to overfitting, making the model sensitive to changes in
the input domain. (2) To mitigate overfitting, these methods typically rely on
complex task-specific model architectures and sensitive hyperparameter tuning,
severely restricting their general applicability. To address these issues, we
propose a simpler and more general framework called GLAD (Generalizable LoRA
tuning with RegulArized GraDient). We show that merely applying LoRA achieves
performance in downstream tasks comparable to current state-of-the-art
prompt-based methods. While LoRA is effective and easy to use, it remains
susceptible to overfitting in few-shot learning scenarios. To mitigate this
risk, we introduce a gradient-based regularization technique. This technique
effectively steers the optimization trajectory, encouraging the model to find a
more stable parameter region that is robust to variations in data distribution.
Through extensive experiments conducted on 15 benchmark datasets, we
demonstrate that GLAD outperforms previous tuning approaches in terms of
base-to-novel class generalization, image domain generalization, and
cross-dataset generalization. The code will be publicly available.

Motivation: 胎儿肺成熟度是预测新生儿结局和干预需求的关键指标，但现有方法依赖手动分割，耗时且限制临床应用。

Method: 使用3D nnU-Net模型进行胎儿肺部分割，并通过模型拟合评估肺成熟度。

Result: 分割模型平均Dice系数为82.14%，自动与手动分割结果无显著差异。

Conclusion: 自动化流程可用于胎儿肺成熟度评估，支持临床决策。

Abstract: Fetal lung maturity is a critical indicator for predicting neonatal outcomes
and the need for post-natal intervention, especially for pregnancies affected
by fetal growth restriction. Intra-voxel incoherent motion analysis has shown
promising results for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung development, but
its reliance on manual segmentation is time-consuming, thus limiting its
clinical applicability. In this work, we present an automated lung maturity
evaluation pipeline for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images that
consists of a deep learning-based fetal lung segmentation model and a
model-fitting lung maturity assessment. A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on
manually segmented images selected from the baseline frames of 4D
diffusion-weighted MRI scans. The segmentation model demonstrated robust
performance, yielding a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%. Next, voxel-wise model
fitting was performed based on both the nnU-Net-predicted and manual lung
segmentations to quantify IVIM parameters reflecting tissue microstructure and
perfusion. The results suggested no differences between the two. Our work shows
that a fully automated pipeline is possible for supporting fetal lung maturity
assessment and clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: R^2MoE是一种高效且有效的终身视觉概念学习方法。

Abstract: Enabling large-scale generative models to continuously learn new visual
concepts is essential for personalizing pre-trained models to meet individual
user preferences. Existing approaches for continual visual concept learning are
constrained by two fundamental challenges: catastrophic forgetting and
parameter expansion. In this paper, we propose Redundancy-Removal Mixture of
Experts (R^2MoE), a parameter-efficient framework for lifelong visual concept
learning that effectively learns new concepts while incurring minimal parameter
overhead. Our framework includes three key innovative contributions: First, we
propose a mixture-of-experts framework with a routing distillation mechanism
that enables experts to acquire concept-specific knowledge while preserving the
gating network's routing capability, thereby effectively mitigating
catastrophic forgetting. Second, we propose a strategy for eliminating
redundant layer-wise experts that reduces the number of expert parameters by
fully utilizing previously learned experts. Third, we employ a hierarchical
local attention-guided inference approach to mitigate interference between
generated visual concepts. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our
method generates images with superior conceptual fidelity compared to the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, achieving an impressive 87.8\% reduction in
forgetting rates and 63.3\% fewer parameters on the CustomConcept 101 dataset.

Abstract: In visual generation tasks, the responses and combinations of complex
concepts often lack stability and are error-prone, which remains an
under-explored area. In this paper, we attempt to explore the causal factors
for poor concept responses through elaborately designed experiments. We also
design a concept-wise equalization loss function (IMBA loss) to address this
issue. Our proposed method is online, eliminating the need for offline dataset
processing, and requires minimal code changes. In our newly proposed complex
concept benchmark Inert-CompBench and two other public test sets, our method
significantly enhances the concept response capability of baseline models and

Result: 在Real3D-AD基准测试中，该方法在对象级和点级异常检测上均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多原型对齐和关键点引导的聚类，显著提升了3D异常检测的精度和稳定性。

Abstract: High-resolution 3D point clouds are highly effective for detecting subtle
structural anomalies in industrial inspection. However, their dense and
irregular nature imposes significant challenges, including high computational
cost, sensitivity to spatial misalignment, and difficulty in capturing
localized structural differences. This paper introduces a registration-based
anomaly detection framework that combines multi-prototype alignment with
cluster-wise discrepancy analysis to enable precise 3D anomaly localization.
Specifically, each test sample is first registered to multiple normal
prototypes to enable direct structural comparison. To evaluate anomalies at a
local level, clustering is performed over the point cloud, and similarity is
computed between features from the test sample and the prototypes within each
cluster. Rather than selecting cluster centroids randomly, a keypoint-guided
strategy is employed, where geometrically informative points are chosen as
centroids. This ensures that clusters are centered on feature-rich regions,
enabling more meaningful and stable distance-based comparisons. Extensive
experiments on the Real3D-AD benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both object-level and point-level
anomaly detection, even using only raw features.

Conclusion: 多模态方法结合语言先验显著提升了红外小目标检测性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: IRSTD (InfraRed Small Target Detection) detects small targets in infrared
blurry backgrounds and is essential for various applications. The detection
task is challenging due to the small size of the targets and their sparse
distribution in infrared small target datasets. Although existing IRSTD methods
and datasets have led to significant advancements, they are limited by their
reliance solely on the image modality. Recent advances in deep learning and
large vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in various
visual recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal IRSTD
framework that incorporates language priors to guide small target detection. We
leverage language-guided attention weights derived from the language prior to
enhance the model's ability for IRSTD, presenting a novel approach that
combines textual information with image data to improve IRSTD capabilities.
Utilizing the state-of-the-art GPT-4 vision model, we generate text
descriptions that provide the locations of small targets in infrared images,
employing careful prompt engineering to ensure improved accuracy. Due to the
absence of multimodal IR datasets, existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image
data. To address this shortcoming, we have curated a multimodal infrared
dataset that includes both image and text modalities for small target
detection, expanding upon the popular IRSTD-1k and NUDT-SIRST datasets. We
validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and
comprehensive ablation studies. The results demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art method, with relative percentage
differences of 9.74%, 13.02%, 1.25%, and 67.87% in IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa on the
NUAA-SIRST subset, and 4.41%, 2.04%, 2.01%, and 113.43% on the IRSTD-1k subset
of the LangIR dataset, respectively.

Result: VideoITG在多模态视频理解基准测试中表现优异，性能持续提升。

Conclusion: VideoITG展示了在视频理解中的优越性和潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video
frames can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy,
employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing
temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt
unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex
scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding
for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user
instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated
annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process.
First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the
instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through
instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection
to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we
construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed
temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,
which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities
of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.
Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements
across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its
superiority and great potentials for video understanding.

Motivation: 遥感图像中小目标检测因空间信息有限、特征表示弱和背景复杂而具有挑战性，现有检测器表现不佳。

Method: 提出RS-TinyNet，包含多维度协作注意力模块（MDCA）、辅助可逆分支（ARB）和渐进融合检测头（PFDH），以增强小目标显著性和特征完整性。

Result: 在AI-TOD数据集上AP提升4.0%，AP75提升6.5%，DIOR数据集验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: 多阶段特征融合策略为复杂遥感环境中的小目标检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing (RS) imagery has been a
long-standing challenge due to their extremely limited spatial information,
weak feature representations, and dense distributions across complex
backgrounds. Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still
underperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a
multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS
tiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel
designs: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction.
Guided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement
modules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA)
module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny
objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive
fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow
and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural
detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our
RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and
6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior
detection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that
the proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and
practical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且无需额外训练，未来将公开代码、模型和数据集以支持研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to significant improvements
in the quality of generated visual content. As AI-generated visual content
becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of
detecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation,
ensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been
substantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for
video detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human
faces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes,
creating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos
with generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that
leverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated
videos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been
trained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can
help distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we
achieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training,
and we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification
layer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we
compiled (VID-AID), which includes around 10,000 AI-generated videos produced
by 9 different text-to-video models, along with 4,000 real videos, totaling
over 7 hours of video content. Our evaluation shows that our approach achieves
high detection accuracy, above 90% on average, underscoring its effectiveness.
Upon acceptance, we plan to publicly release the code, the pre-trained models,
and our dataset to support ongoing research in this critical area.

Conclusion: DiffClean有效防御化妆攻击，提升年龄验证和面部识别的可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate age verification can protect underage users from unauthorized access
to online platforms and e-commerce sites that provide age-restricted services.
However, accurate age estimation can be confounded by several factors,
including facial makeup that can induce changes to alter perceived identity and
age to fool both humans and machines. In this work, we propose DiffClean which
erases makeup traces using a text-guided diffusion model to defend against
makeup attacks. DiffClean improves age estimation (minor vs. adult accuracy by
4.8%) and face verification (TMR by 8.9% at FMR=0.01%) over competing baselines
on digitally simulated and real makeup images.

Abstract: Realistic and controllable garment visualization is critical for fashion
e-commerce, where users expect personalized previews under diverse poses and

introduce FashionPose, the first unified text-to-pose-to-relighting generation
framework. Given a natural language description, our method first predicts a 2D
human pose, then employs a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity person

Abstract: Hand-object interaction detection remains an open challenge in real-time
applications, where intuitive user experiences depend on fast and accurate
detection of interactions with surrounding objects. We propose an efficient
approach for detecting hand-objects interactions from streaming egocentric
vision that operates in real time. Our approach consists of an action
recognition module and an object detection module for identifying active
objects upon confirmed interaction. Our Mamba model with EfficientNetV2 as
backbone for action recognition achieves 38.52% p-AP on the ENIGMA-51 benchmark
at 30fps, while our fine-tuned YOLOWorld reaches 85.13% AP for hand and object.
We implement our models in a cascaded architecture where the action recognition
and object detection modules operate sequentially. When the action recognition
predicts a contact state, it activates the object detection module, which in
turn performs inference on the relevant frame to detect and classify the active
object.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have shown strong performance in video
generation tasks, but their high computational cost makes them impractical for
resource-constrained devices like smartphones, and real-time generation is even
more challenging. In this work, we propose a series of novel optimizations to

quality. Second, we introduce a KD-guided, sensitivity-aware tri-level pruning
strategy to shrink the model size to suit mobile platform while preserving
critical performance characteristics. Third, we develop an adversarial step
distillation technique tailored for DiT, which allows us to reduce the number

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of high-fidelity view synthesis of humans
with sparse-view videos as input. Previous methods solve the issue of
insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos
at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack
spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this
paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the
spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define
a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human
pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the
latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and
finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised
latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across
the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field
and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory
consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ
datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and
consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing
approaches. See our project page for interactive demos and video results:

Conclusion: AutoPartGen展示了强大的3D部件生成能力，适用于组合式3D重建任务。

Abstract: We introduce AutoPartGen, a model that generates objects composed of 3D parts
in an autoregressive manner. This model can take as input an image of an
object, 2D masks of the object's parts, or an existing 3D object, and generate
a corresponding compositional 3D reconstruction. Our approach builds upon
3DShape2VecSet, a recent latent 3D representation with powerful geometric
expressiveness. We observe that this latent space exhibits strong compositional
properties, making it particularly well-suited for part-based generation tasks.
Specifically, AutoPartGen generates object parts autoregressively, predicting
one part at a time while conditioning on previously generated parts and
additional inputs, such as 2D images, masks, or 3D objects. This process
continues until the model decides that all parts have been generated, thus
determining automatically the type and number of parts. The resulting parts can
be seamlessly assembled into coherent objects or scenes without requiring
additional optimization. We evaluate both the overall 3D generation
capabilities and the part-level generation quality of AutoPartGen,
demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D part
generation.

approach to visual geometry reconstruction, breaking the reliance on a
conventional fixed reference view. Previous methods often anchor their
reconstructions to a designated viewpoint, an inductive bias that can lead to
instability and failures if the reference is suboptimal. In contrast, $\pi^3$
employs a fully permutation-equivariant architecture to predict
affine-invariant camera poses and scale-invariant local point maps without any
reference frames. This design makes our model inherently robust to input
ordering and highly scalable. These advantages enable our simple and bias-free
approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks,
including camera pose estimation, monocular/video depth estimation, and dense
point map reconstruction. Code and models are publicly available.

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a compelling generative modeling approach that
is widely used across domains. To generate data via a flow matching model, an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward
integration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality
that is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was
recently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically
integrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the
multi-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of
modeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model
multi-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution
remains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how
to gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels
of the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch
couplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on
synthetic and imaging data. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合分布式和符号表示的‘模型合成架构’（MSA），用于模拟人类在开放领域中的推理能力，并通过实验验证其优于纯语言模型基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类如何在新情境中整合广泛背景知识并进行连贯推理，探索其背后的认知机制。

Method: 提出MSA架构，结合语言模型实现全局相关性检索与模型合成，以及概率程序实现定制化世界模型。

Result: MSA在‘模型奥运会’数据集上比纯语言模型基线更接近人类判断，支持链式思维生成。

Conclusion: MSA为理解和复制人类开放领域推理能力提供了可行路径。

Abstract: When faced with novel situations, people are able to marshal relevant
considerations from a wide range of background knowledge and put these to use
in inferences and predictions. What permits us to draw in globally relevant
information and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that
people use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to
construct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a
computational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''
(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval
and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent
world models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel
reasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of
sports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning
by requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;
(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in
light of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA
approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,
under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports
model synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way
that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over
globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating
human reasoning in open-ended domains.

Motivation: 探讨LMs是否能够准确分类句子模态（可能、不可能、无意义等），并揭示其与人类分类行为的潜在联系。

Method: 识别LMs中的模态差异向量，分析其在不同模型能力（训练步数、层数、参数）下的出现规律，并与人类分类行为进行对比。

Conclusion: 通过机制可解释性技术，研究为LMs的模态分类提供了新见解，并可能增进对人类模态分类的理解。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question
answering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these
tasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,
whether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely
nonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the
ability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,
2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that
discriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal
difference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have
access to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously
reported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a
consistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,
layers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors
identified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human
categorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human
participants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by
correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'
ratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM
modal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with
the potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.

Motivation: 解决美国药物过量死亡数据因自由文本报告和ICD-10编码导致的延迟和信息丢失问题。

Method: 使用35,433条2020年死亡记录训练模型，并在3,335条2023-2024年记录上验证，评估多种NLP方法。

Result: BioClinicalBERT在内部测试集上F1分数>=0.998，外部验证F1=0.966，表现最优。

Conclusion: NLP模型（如BioClinicalBERT）能显著提升药物过量监测效率，支持实时趋势检测。

Abstract: The rising rate of drug-related deaths in the United States, largely driven
by fentanyl, requires timely and accurate surveillance. However, critical
overdose data are often buried in free-text coroner reports, leading to delays
and information loss when coded into ICD (International Classification of
Disease)-10 classifications. Natural language processing (NLP) models may
automate and enhance overdose surveillance, but prior applications have been
limited. A dataset of 35,433 death records from multiple U.S. jurisdictions in
2020 was used for model training and internal testing. External validation was
conducted using a novel separate dataset of 3,335 records from 2023-2024.
Multiple NLP approaches were evaluated for classifying specific drug
involvement from unstructured death certificate text. These included
traditional single- and multi-label classifiers, as well as fine-tuned
encoder-only language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) and BioClinicalBERT, and contemporary decoder-only large
language models such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3. Model performance was assessed
using macro-averaged F1 scores, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to
quantify uncertainty. Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models achieved near-perfect
performance, with macro F1 scores >=0.998 on the internal test set. External
validation confirmed robustness (macro F1=0.966), outperforming conventional
machine learning, general-domain BERT models, and various decoder-only large
language models. NLP models, particularly fine-tuned clinical variants like
BioClinicalBERT, offer a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose
death classification from free-text reports. These methods can significantly
accelerate surveillance workflows, overcoming the limitations of manual ICD-10
coding and supporting near real-time detection of emerging substance use
trends.

Motivation: 解决传统文本模型和其他多模态方法在情感分析和方面词提取中的局限性，特别是在处理多模态数据时。

Method: 采用动态模态加权和上下文自适应注意力机制，结合文本和视觉信息。

Result: 在标准Twitter数据集上，AdaptiSent在精确率、召回率和F1分数上优于现有模型，尤其擅长识别复杂的模态间关系。

Conclusion: AdaptiSent为多模态基于方面的情感分析设定了新标准，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce AdaptiSent, a new framework for Multimodal Aspect-Based
Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) that uses adaptive cross-modal attention mechanisms
to improve sentiment classification and aspect term extraction from both text
and images. Our model integrates dynamic modality weighting and
context-adaptive attention, enhancing the extraction of sentiment and
aspect-related information by focusing on how textual cues and visual context
interact. We tested our approach against several baselines, including
traditional text-based models and other multimodal methods. Results from
standard Twitter datasets show that AdaptiSent surpasses existing models in
precision, recall, and F1 score, and is particularly effective in identifying
nuanced inter-modal relationships that are crucial for accurate sentiment and
aspect term extraction. This effectiveness comes from the model's ability to
adjust its focus dynamically based on the context's relevance, improving the
depth and accuracy of sentiment analysis across various multimodal data sets.
AdaptiSent sets a new standard for MABSA, significantly outperforming current
methods, especially in understanding complex multimodal information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音评估存在两个关键问题：针对特定音频特征设计专用系统的需求与困难，以及自动评估方法与人类偏好的相关性差。

Method: 通过探索音频特征检测任务（如发音、语速、说话人识别和语音质量）和系统级人类偏好模拟，研究不同提示工程策略，提出音频拼接与上下文学习结合的方法，并引入多方面集成AudioJudge。

Result: 多方面的AudioJudge在系统排名基准测试中与人类偏好的Spearman相关性高达0.91，但在噪声环境下存在冗长和位置偏差问题。

Conclusion: AudioJudge为语音评估提供了统一的框架，但需进一步解决模型偏差和噪声鲁棒性问题。

Abstract: Current speech evaluation suffers from two critical limitations: the need and
difficulty of designing specialized systems targeting individual audio
characteristics, and poor correlation between automatic evaluation methods and
human preferences. This work presents a systematic study of Large Audio Model
(LAM) as a Judge, AudioJudge, investigating whether it can provide a unified
evaluation framework that addresses both challenges. We systematically explore
AudioJudge across audio characteristic detection tasks, including
pronunciation, speaking rate, speaker identification and speech quality, and
system-level human preference simulation for automated benchmarking. We
investigate different prompt engineering strategies, finding that audio
concatenation combined with in-context learning significantly improves
performance across both audio characteristic detection and human preference
simulation tasks. We further introduce a multi-aspect ensemble AudioJudge to
enable general-purpose multi-aspect audio evaluation. This method decomposes
speech assessment into specialized judges for lexical content, speech quality,
and paralinguistic features, achieving up to 0.91 Spearman correlation with
human preferences on our system ranking benchmark. Robustness analysis reveals
that while LAMs maintain strong performance under acoustic noise, they exhibit
significant verbosity and positional biases that require careful mitigation.

Motivation: 传统语言模型的分词器在适应新数据分布时过于僵化，导致分词效率低下，尤其在处理分布外数据或新语言时。

Method: 开发了字节级语言模型，引入可学习的分词器模块，预测输入字节序列的边界，并提出简化的训练目标FLEXITOKENS。

Result: 在多项多语言和形态多样任务中，FLEXITOKENS显著减少分词过碎，下游任务性能提升高达10%。

Conclusion: FLEXITOKENS通过自适应分词器解决了传统方法的僵化问题，显著提升了语言模型的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are challenging to adapt to new data distributions by
simple finetuning. This is due to the rigidity of their subword tokenizers,
which typically remain unchanged during adaptation. This inflexibility often
leads to inefficient tokenization, causing overfragmentation of
out-of-distribution domains, unseen languages, or scripts. In this work, we
develop byte-level LMs with learnable tokenizers to make tokenization adaptive.
Our models include a submodule that learns to predict boundaries between the
input byte sequence, encoding it into variable-length segments. Existing
tokenizer-free methods train this boundary predictor using an auxiliary loss
that enforces a fixed compression rate across the training corpus, introducing
a new kind of rigidity. We propose FLEXITOKENS, a simplified training objective
that enables significantly greater flexibility during adaptation. Evaluating
across multiple multilingual benchmarks, morphologically diverse tasks, and
domains, we demonstrate that FLEXITOKENS consistently reduces token
over-fragmentation and achieves up to 10\% improvements on downstream task
performance compared to subword and other gradient-based tokenizers. Code and
data for our experiments will be released at

Result: TransEvalnia在多种语言对上表现优于现有技术，评分与人类评分高度相关，但存在位置偏差问题。

Conclusion: TransEvalnia是一个有效的翻译评估工具，但需解决位置偏差问题，数据、代码和评估结果已公开。

Abstract: We present TransEvalnia, a prompting-based translation evaluation and ranking
system that uses reasoning in performing its evaluations and ranking. This
system presents fine-grained evaluations based on a subset of the
Multidimensional Quality Metrics (https://themqm.org/), returns an assessment
of which translation it deems the best, and provides numerical scores for the
various dimensions and for the overall translation. We show that TransEvalnia
performs as well as or better than the state-of-the-art MT-Ranker (Moosa et al.
2024) on our own English-Japanese data as well as several language pairs from
various WMT shared tasks. Using Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct as the evaluation LLMs, we show that the evaluations
returned are deemed highly acceptable to human raters, and that the scores
assigned to the translations by Sonnet, as well as other LLMs, correlate well
with scores assigned by the human raters. We also note the sensitivity of our
system -- as well as MT-Ranker -- to the order in which the translations are
presented, and we propose methods to address this position bias. All data,
including the system's evaluation and reasoning, human assessments, as well as
code is released.

Abstract: This study proposes a method to improve the performance of Werewolf agents by

Result: 在四个数学数据集上，ThinkLogit和ThinkLogit-DPO分别相对提升26%和29%的pass@1。

Conclusion: ThinkLogit是一种计算高效的方法，能以最小或无需额外训练的方式提升大型模型的长推理能力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) can do complex reasoning via long
chain-of-thought (CoT) involving cognitive strategies such as backtracking and
self-correction. Recent studies suggest that some models inherently possess
these long reasoning abilities, which may be unlocked via extra training. Our
work first investigates whether we can elicit such behavior without any
training. To this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which
utilizes logits arithmetic (Liu et al., 2024) to tune a target large LM for
long reasoning using a substantially smaller model as guider. We then show that
we can further boost performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model -- a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our
experiments demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative
improvement in pass@1 by 26% and 29%, respectively, over four mathematical
datasets using the Qwen2.5-32B when guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B -- a model
21x smaller. Lastly, we show that ThinkLogit can transfer long reasoning skills
acquired through reinforcement learning, improving pass@1 by 13% relative
compared to the Qwen2.5-32B base model. Our work presents a
computationally-efficient method to elicit long reasoning in large models with
minimal or no additional training.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Synergy, a language model that bridges different
levels of abstraction in an end-to-end fashion through a learned routing
mechanism. Focusing on low-level linguistic abstraction, we trained our model
as a byte-level language model. Our model spontaneously learns to tokenize
bytes, producing fewer concept tokens than Byte-level Byte Pair Encoder (BBPE)
tokenizers while keeping comparable performance. By comparing with Llama3, we
observed an advantage of Synergy under the same model scale and training
dataset size. Further studies show that the middle part (the higher abstraction
part) of our model performs better when positional encodings are removed,
suggesting the emergence of position-independent concepts. These findings
demonstrate the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures, paving the way for
more robust and flexible pipelines.

Result: 在否定理解能力上显著提升，同时保持通用基准的竞争力，方法也可适配大型语言模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升文本编码器的否定鲁棒性，且具有通用性和扩展性。

Abstract: Despite rapid adoption of autoregressive large language models, smaller text
encoders still play an important role in text understanding tasks that require
rich contextualized representations. Negation is an important semantic function
that is still not properly captured by such methods, affecting many downstream
applications relying on text embeddings. We propose a strategy to improve
negation robustness of text encoders, by distilling data from large language
models using diverse patterns of negation and hedging. We adopt a standard
contrastive learning strategy to finetune a strong BERT-based model, and
observe large improvement in negation understanding capabilities while
maintaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. In addition, we also
show that our method can be adapted to LLMs, leading to improved performance on
negation benchmarks.

Result: LLMs能推断基本音乐结构和时间关系，但在缺乏明确音乐背景时表现有限。

Conclusion: LLMs在符号音乐生成中具有潜力，但需要进一步改进以弥补音乐背景的不足。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at modeling relationships between strings
in natural language and have shown promise in extending to other symbolic
domains like coding or mathematics. However, the extent to which they
implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates
how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from
textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating
their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of
LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then
train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform
genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their
performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can
infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text,
highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and
their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on
their generative capabilities for symbolic music.

Conclusion: 跨语言对齐监督和代码切换训练对提升多语言性能和知识一致性至关重要。

Abstract: Cross-lingual consistency should be considered to assess cross-lingual
transferability, maintain the factuality of the model knowledge across
languages, and preserve the parity of language model performance. We are thus
interested in analyzing, evaluating, and interpreting cross-lingual consistency
for factual knowledge. We examine code-mixed coreferential statements conveyed
identical knowledge across languages to study cross-lingual knowledge
consistency. We use some interpretability approaches to analyze the behavior of
a model in cross-lingual contexts, discovering that multilingual models show
different levels of consistency, subject to language families, linguistic
factors, and a bottleneck in cross-lingual consistency on a particular layer.
In addition, we evaluate common strategies aimed at improving multilingual
performance to observe whether these strategies can improve knowledge
consistency at the same time. While knowledge is not cross-lingual consistency
in many cases, code-switching training and cross-lingual word alignment
objectives show the most promising results, emphasizing the noteworthiness of
cross-lingual alignment supervision and code-switching training for both
multilingual performance and cross-lingual consistency enhancement.

Conclusion: 研究表明，分层解码器架构具有潜力，未来可探索从头预训练的通用分层推理器。

Abstract: Decoder-only language models, such as GPT and LLaMA, generally decode on the
last layer. Motivated by human's hierarchical thinking capability, we propose
that a hierarchical decoder architecture could be built with different layers
decoding texts simultaneously. Due to limited time and computationally
resources, we choose to adapt a pretrained language model into this form of
hierarchical decoder. Language heads of the last layer are copied to different
selected intermediate layers, and fine-tuned with different task inputs. By
thorough experiments, we validate that these selective intermediate layers
could be adapted to speak meaningful and reasonable contents, and this paradigm
of hierarchical decoder can obtain state-of-the-art performances on multiple
tasks such as hierarchical text classification, classification-guided
generation, and hierarchical text generation. This study suggests the
possibility of a generalized hierarchical reasoner, pretraining from scratch.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决西班牙语表格问答任务（PRESTA）的挑战，提升问答系统的准确性和效率。

Method: 采用多步骤流程：分析表格内容、选择有用列、生成自然语言指令、转换为代码并执行，结合开源LLM和优化提示。

Result: 在任务中达到了85%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过代码生成和优化提示，有效提升了表格问答任务的性能。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach for the IberLEF 2025 Task PRESTA: Preguntas
y Respuestas sobre Tablas en Espa\~nol (Questions and Answers about Tables in
Spanish). Our solution obtains answers to the questions by implementing Python
code generation with LLMs that is used to filter and process the table. This
solution evolves from the MRT implementation for the Semeval 2025 related task.
The process consists of multiple steps: analyzing and understanding the content
of the table, selecting the useful columns, generating instructions in natural
language, translating these instructions to code, running it, and handling
potential errors or exceptions. These steps use open-source LLMs and
fine-grained optimized prompts for each step. With this approach, we achieved
an accuracy score of 85\% in the task.

Result: 模型可用于上游攻击分析和自动生成网络安全训练的攻击脚本。

Conclusion: 该研究为网络安全自动化提供了实用的形式化工具，支持攻击分析和训练脚本生成。

Abstract: Organizations face an ever-changing threat landscape. They must continuously
dedicate significant efforts to protect their assets, making their adoption of
increased cybersecurity automation inevitable. However, process automation
requires formalization of input data. Through this paper, we address this need
for processes that use attack scenarios as input. Among these processes, one
can mention both the generation of scripts for attack simulation and training
purposes, as well as the analysis of attacks. Therefore, the paper's main
research contribution is a novel formal model that encompasses the attack's
context description and its scenario. It is abstracted using UML class model.
Once the description of our model done, we will show how it could serve an
upstream attack analysis process. We will show also its use for an automatic
generation of attack scripts in the context of cybersecurity training. These
two uses cases constitute the second contribution of this present research
work.

TL;DR: SemCSE是一种无监督学习方法，用于学习科学文本的语义嵌入，通过对比学习和LLM生成的摘要训练模型，优于传统基于引用的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于引用的方法无法准确反映语义相似性，因此需要一种更有效的方法来捕捉科学文本的真实语义内容。

Method: 利用对比学习和LLM生成的科学摘要训练模型，使语义相关的摘要更接近。

Result: 在SciRepEval基准测试中达到同类模型的最先进性能，验证了语义聚焦训练的优势。

Conclusion: SemCSE通过语义聚焦训练，显著提升了科学文本嵌入的质量和语义分离能力。

Abstract: We introduce SemCSE, an unsupervised method for learning semantic embeddings
of scientific texts. Building on recent advances in contrastive learning for
text embeddings, our approach leverages LLM-generated summaries of scientific
abstracts to train a model that positions semantically related summaries closer
together in the embedding space. This resulting objective ensures that the
model captures the true semantic content of a text, in contrast to traditional
citation-based approaches that do not necessarily reflect semantic similarity.
To validate this, we propose a novel benchmark designed to assess a model's
ability to understand and encode the semantic content of scientific texts,
demonstrating that our method enforces a stronger semantic separation within
the embedding space. Additionally, we evaluate SemCSE on the comprehensive
SciRepEval benchmark for scientific text embeddings, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among models of its size, thus highlighting the
benefits of a semantically focused training approach.

TL;DR: 该博士提案计划开发一个计算框架，用于识别文本中的自我方面，填补NLP领域的空白，并应用于心理健康和现象学研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自我是一个多面性概念，在语言中有所体现，但在自然语言处理（NLP）中尚未充分探索。其与心理健康等领域的关联性凸显了系统化NLP分析的必要性。

Method: 计划构建自我方面的本体论和标注数据集，开发并评估判别模型、生成大语言模型和嵌入检索方法，重点关注可解释性、准确性等标准。

Result: 将最佳模型应用于心理健康和现象学的案例研究。

Conclusion: 该框架有望为NLP中的自我研究提供系统化工具，并推动相关领域的应用。

Abstract: This Ph.D. proposal introduces a plan to develop a computational framework to
identify Self-aspects in text. The Self is a multifaceted construct and it is
reflected in language. While it is described across disciplines like cognitive
science and phenomenology, it remains underexplored in natural language
processing (NLP). Many of the aspects of the Self align with psychological and
other well-researched phenomena (e.g., those related to mental health),
highlighting the need for systematic NLP-based analysis. In line with this, we
plan to introduce an ontology of Self-aspects and a gold-standard annotated
dataset. Using this foundation, we will develop and evaluate conventional
discriminative models, generative large language models, and embedding-based
retrieval approaches against four main criteria: interpretability, ground-truth
adherence, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Top-performing models will
be applied in case studies in mental health and empirical phenomenology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了标注者人口统计特征对标注决策的影响，发现其仅占方差的8%，内容仍是主要因素。评估生成式AI作为标注者的可靠性，发现简单的人口统计提示效果不佳，内容驱动的方法更可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解标注变异性来源对开发公平的NLP系统至关重要，尤其是在涉及人口统计偏见的任务（如性别歧视检测）中。

Method: 使用广义线性混合模型量化人口统计特征的影响，并评估生成式AI模型在标注任务中的表现。

Result: 人口统计因素仅占方差的8%，内容主导；生成式AI的简单人口统计提示效果不佳，内容驱动方法更可靠。

Conclusion: 内容驱动的解释和稳健的标注协议比人口统计模拟更有利于实现公平性。

Abstract: Understanding the sources of variability in annotations is crucial for
developing fair NLP systems, especially for tasks like sexism detection where
demographic bias is a concern. This study investigates the extent to which
annotator demographic features influence labeling decisions compared to text
content. Using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, we quantify this inf luence,
finding that while statistically present, demographic factors account for a
minor fraction ( 8%) of the observed variance, with tweet content being the
dominant factor. We then assess the reliability of Generative AI (GenAI) models
as annotators, specifically evaluating if guiding them with demographic
personas improves alignment with human judgments. Our results indicate that
simplistic persona prompting often fails to enhance, and sometimes degrades,
performance compared to baseline models. Furthermore, explainable AI (XAI)
techniques reveal that model predictions rely heavily on content-specific
tokens related to sexism, rather than correlates of demographic
characteristics. We argue that focusing on content-driven explanations and
robust annotation protocols offers a more reliable path towards fairness than
potentially persona simulation.

Motivation: 探究口语叙事能力与儿童发展需求的关系，为多语言环境下的早期评估提供依据。

Method: 使用简单机器学习方法分析4-5岁儿童的录音故事，关注词汇多样性和长度特征。

Result: 词汇多样性和平均话语长度是典型发展的指标，而特定动词和助动词的使用与干预需求减少相关。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言特异性和共享的叙事能力预测因素，对多语言早期评估有重要意义。

Abstract: Oral narrative skills are strong predictors of later literacy development.
This study examines the features of oral narratives from children who were
identified by experts as requiring intervention. Using simple machine learning
methods, we analyse recorded stories from four- and five-year-old Afrikaans-
and isiXhosa-speaking children. Consistent with prior research, we identify
lexical diversity (unique words) and length-based features (mean utterance
length) as indicators of typical development, but features like articulation
rate prove less informative. Despite cross-linguistic variation in
part-of-speech patterns, the use of specific verbs and auxiliaries associated
with goal-directed storytelling is correlated with a reduced likelihood of
requiring intervention. Our analysis of two linguistically distinct languages
reveals both language-specific and shared predictors of narrative proficiency,
with implications for early assessment in multilingual contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GEMMAS是一个基于图的评估框架，用于分析多智能体系统的内部协作过程，通过信息多样性分数（IDS）和不必要路径比率（UPR）衡量协作质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估仅关注最终输出的正确性，忽略了低效通信和协调导致的冗余推理和高计算成本。

Method: 提出GEMMAS框架，将智能体交互建模为有向无环图，并引入IDS和UPR两个过程级指标。

Result: 在GSM8K基准测试中，准确率仅差2.1%的系统在IDS和UPR上差异显著（12.8%和80%）。

Conclusion: 仅基于结果的指标不足以评估多智能体性能，过程级诊断对设计高效协作AI系统至关重要。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on language models have shown strong performance on
collaborative reasoning tasks. However, existing evaluations focus only on the
correctness of the final output, overlooking how inefficient communication and
poor coordination contribute to redundant reasoning and higher computational
costs. We introduce GEMMAS, a graph-based evaluation framework that analyzes
the internal collaboration process by modeling agent interactions as a directed
acyclic graph. To capture collaboration quality, we propose two process-level
metrics: Information Diversity Score (IDS) to measure semantic variation in
inter-agent messages, and Unnecessary Path Ratio (UPR) to quantify redundant
reasoning paths. We evaluate GEMMAS across five benchmarks and highlight
results on GSM8K, where systems with only a 2.1% difference in accuracy differ
by 12.8% in IDS and 80% in UPR, revealing substantial variation in internal
collaboration. These findings demonstrate that outcome-only metrics are
insufficient for evaluating multi-agent performance and highlight the
importance of process-level diagnostics in designing more interpretable and
resource-efficient collaborative AI systems.

Result: LLM模型在多数情况下优于线性模型，且接近人类专家水平，线性模型表现也具竞争力。

Conclusion: 为课堂自动口语评估奠定基础，帮助教师更专注于个性化学习支持。

Abstract: Developing narrative and comprehension skills in early childhood is critical
for later literacy. However, teachers in large preschool classrooms struggle to
accurately identify students who require intervention. We present a system for
automatically assessing oral narratives of preschool children in Afrikaans and
isiXhosa. The system uses automatic speech recognition followed by a machine
learning scoring model to predict narrative and comprehension scores. For
scoring predicted transcripts, we compare a linear model to a large language
model (LLM). The LLM-based system outperforms the linear model in most cases,
but the linear system is competitive despite its simplicity. The LLM-based
system is comparable to a human expert in flagging children who require
intervention. We lay the foundation for automatic oral assessments in
classrooms, giving teachers extra capacity to focus on personalised support for
children's learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在数据稀缺场景下对未见任务表现不佳，现有跨任务上下文学习方法在鲁棒性、可扩展性和效率方面存在挑战。

Method: 通过分析LLMs潜在空间中的激活模式，提出CAST框架，利用高资源任务的样本激活状态来适应低资源任务。

Result: 实验表明，CAST在跨领域和跨语言迁移中优于基线方法，具有更高的可扩展性和更低的计算成本。

Conclusion: CAST通过潜在空间激活操纵实现了高效的跨任务知识迁移，为数据稀缺场景下的模型适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in leveraging
pretrained knowledge through prompting, but they often struggle with unseen
tasks, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. While cross-task in-context
learning offers a direct solution for transferring knowledge across tasks, it
still faces critical challenges in terms of robustness, scalability, and
efficiency. In this paper, we investigate whether cross-task transfer can be
achieved via latent space steering without parameter updates or input
expansion. Through an analysis of activation patterns in the latent space of
LLMs, we observe that the enhanced activations induced by in-context examples
have consistent patterns across different tasks. Inspired by these findings, we
propose CAST, a novel Cross-task Activation Steering Transfer framework that
enables effective transfer by manipulating the model's internal activation
states. Our approach first selects influential and diverse samples from
high-resource tasks, then utilizes their contrastive representation-enhanced
activations to adapt LLMs to low-resource tasks. Extensive experiments across
both cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer settings show that our method
outperforms competitive baselines and demonstrates superior scalability and
lower computational costs.

Method: 使用405道印度政府考试中的选择题构建HATS，测试多语言LLM，并提出基于认知理论的类比推理方法。

Result: 模型在英语提示下表现最佳，提出的方法提升了印地语类比问题的性能。

Conclusion: HATS填补了印地语中评估LLM推理能力的资源空白，并展示了认知理论方法的有效性。

Abstract: Analogies test a model's ability to infer implicit relationships between
concepts, making them a key benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities.
While large language models (LLMs) are widely evaluated for reasoning in
English, their abilities in Indic languages remain understudied, limiting our
understanding of whether these models generalize across languages. To address
this gap, we introduce a new Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS), comprising 405
multiple-choice questions sourced from Indian government exams. We benchmark
state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs using various prompting strategies and
introduce a grounded Chain of Thought approach that leverages cognitive
theories of analogical reasoning. This approach improves model performance on
Hindi analogy questions. Our experiments show that models perform best with
English prompts, irrespective of the prompting strategy. Our test set addresses
the lack of a critical resource to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities in
Hindi.

TL;DR: AutoSteer是一种模块化、自适应的推理时间干预技术，旨在提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的安全性，无需微调模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在跨模态推理方面表现出色，但也面临对抗性多模态输入的安全风险。

Method: AutoSteer包含三个核心组件：安全感知评分（SAS）、自适应安全探测器、轻量级拒绝头，用于识别和干预安全风险。

Result: 实验表明，AutoSteer显著降低了文本、视觉和跨模态威胁的攻击成功率（ASR），同时保持模型的一般能力。

Conclusion: AutoSteer为多模态AI系统的安全部署提供了实用、可解释且有效的框架。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked
powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns,
particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the
safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive
inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any
fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core
components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically
identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal
layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of
toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal
Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are
detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical
benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success
Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining
general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical,
interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI
systems.

Motivation: 近期研究质疑强化学习在提升多步推理（尤其是难题）上的有效性，因此需要一种新方法来降低问题难度并提供更有信息量的学习信号。

Method: 提出QuestA策略，通过在训练中引入部分解决方案来降低问题难度，增强学习信号。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，QuestA显著提升了pass@1和pass@k性能，尤其在标准RL难以取得进展的问题上。1.5B参数模型在多个数学基准测试中达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: QuestA不仅提升了推理能力，还提供了理论解释，为通过RL扩展推理能力提供了一条实用且可推广的路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key component in training large
language reasoning models (LLMs). However, recent studies questions its
effectiveness in improving multi-step reasoning-particularly on hard problems.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via
Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce
problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method,
QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only
improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL
struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong
open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing
their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math
benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 67.1% (+5.3%) on AIME24, 59.5% (+10.0%)
on AIME25, and 35.5% (+4.0%) on HMMT25. Further, we provide theoretical
explanations that QuestA improves sample efficiency, offering a practical and
generalizable pathway for expanding reasoning capability through RL.

Motivation: 当前自然语言处理和大型语言模型在人力资源管理中的应用缺乏公开数据和基准，阻碍了可靠和公平模型的开发。

Method: TalentCLEF 2025设计了两个任务：多语言职位匹配（英语、西班牙语、德语、中文）和基于职位标题的技能预测（英语），使用真实匿名化数据并手动标注。

Result: 76个团队参与，提交280多次，结果显示训练策略比模型规模影响更大。

Conclusion: TalentCLEF填补了公开基准的空白，促进了劳动力市场中稳健、公平和可迁移语言技术的发展。

Abstract: Advances in natural language processing and large language models are driving
a major transformation in Human Capital Management, with a growing interest in
building smart systems based on language technologies for talent acquisition,
upskilling strategies, and workforce planning. However, the adoption and
progress of these technologies critically depend on the development of reliable
and fair models, properly evaluated on public data and open benchmarks, which
have so far been unavailable in this domain.
  To address this gap, we present TalentCLEF 2025, the first evaluation
campaign focused on skill and job title intelligence. The lab consists of two
tasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish,
German, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English.
Both corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and
manually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor
market data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.
  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered
the evaluation of gender bias.
  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions. Most
systems relied on information retrieval techniques built with multilingual
encoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and several of them
incorporated large language models for data augmentation or re-ranking. The
results show that the training strategies have a larger effect than the size of
the model alone. TalentCLEF provides the first public benchmark in this field
and encourages the development of robust, fair, and transferable language
technologies for the labor market.

Conclusion: RCPS和PREVAL为自动化生成和评估高质量演示提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Automated generation of high-quality media presentations is challenging,
requiring robust content extraction, narrative planning, visual design, and
overall quality optimization. Existing methods often produce presentations with
logical inconsistencies and suboptimal layouts, thereby struggling to meet
professional standards. To address these challenges, we introduce RCPS
(Reflective Coherent Presentation Synthesis), a novel framework integrating
three key components: (1) Deep Structured Narrative Planning; (2) Adaptive
Layout Generation; (3) an Iterative Optimization Loop. Additionally, we propose
PREVAL, a preference-based evaluation framework employing rationale-enhanced
multi-dimensional models to assess presentation quality across Content,
Coherence, and Design. Experimental results demonstrate that RCPS significantly
outperforms baseline methods across all quality dimensions, producing
presentations that closely approximate human expert standards. PREVAL shows
strong correlation with human judgments, validating it as a reliable automated
tool for assessing presentation quality.

Method: 基于1,500个专家标注的NLP论文示例，评估LLMs生成消融研究设计的能力，并开发AbGen-Eval评估自动评估系统的可靠性。

Result: LLMs在消融研究设计上与人类专家差距显著，现有自动评估方法不可靠。

Conclusion: AbGen和AbGen-Eval为未来开发更可靠的LLM评估系统提供了基础。

Abstract: We introduce AbGen, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities
of LLMs in designing ablation studies for scientific research. AbGen consists
of 1,500 expert-annotated examples derived from 807 NLP papers. In this
benchmark, LLMs are tasked with generating detailed ablation study designs for
a specified module or process based on the given research context. Our
evaluation of leading LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini, highlights a
significant performance gap between these models and human experts in terms of
the importance, faithfulness, and soundness of the ablation study designs.
Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not
reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to
human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a
meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used
automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task. We
investigate various LLM-as-Judge systems on AbGen-Eval, providing insights for
future research on developing more effective and reliable LLM-based evaluation

collecting haptic descriptions is time-consuming, and (2) limited capability of
existing tasks and models to describe vibration signals in text. To advance
this area, we create HapticCap, the first fully human-annotated
haptic-captioned dataset, containing 92,070 haptic-text pairs for user
descriptions of sensory, emotional, and associative attributes of vibrations.
Based on HapticCap, we propose the haptic-caption retrieval task and present
the results of this task from a supervised contrastive learning framework that
brings together text representations within specific categories and vibrations.
Overall, the combination of language model T5 and audio model AST yields the
best performance in the haptic-caption retrieval task, especially when
separately trained for each description category.

TL;DR: 研究探讨搜索引擎如何通过内容优先级和用户意识形态查询加剧搜索结果的偏见，揭示其对公共话语和信息极化的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索搜索引擎和用户意识形态查询如何共同导致搜索结果偏见，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 分析主要搜索引擎在政治和社会话题上的输出数据。

Result: 搜索引擎不仅反映潜在偏见，意识形态驱动的用户查询还进一步加剧偏见，放大特定叙事。不同搜索引擎在内容优先级上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 搜索引擎通过强化意识形态分歧，可能在塑造公众认知和信息极化中起关键作用。

Abstract: Search engines play a crucial role in shaping public discourse by influencing
how information is accessed and framed. While prior research has extensively
examined various dimensions of search bias -- such as content prioritization,
indexical bias, political polarization, and sources of bias -- an important
question remains underexplored: how do search engines and
ideologically-motivated user queries contribute to bias in search results. This
study analyzes the outputs of major search engines using a dataset of political
and social topics. The findings reveal that search engines not only prioritize
content in ways that reflect underlying biases but also that
ideologically-driven user queries exacerbate these biases, resulting in the
amplification of specific narratives. Moreover, significant differences were
observed across search engines in terms of the sources they prioritize. These
results suggest that search engines may play a pivotal role in shaping public
perceptions by reinforcing ideological divides, thereby contributing to the
broader issue of information polarization.

TL;DR: VL训练对语言模型的词汇-概念知识组织有影响，但主要在任务执行方式而非知识本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉-语言（VL）训练是否显著改变语言模型的词汇-概念知识组织。

Method: 比较纯文本语言模型和VL训练模型在文本问答任务中的表现，并进行行为与表征分析。

Result: VL模型在需要分类学理解的文本任务中表现更好，但分类学知识本身变化不大。

Conclusion: VL训练改善了任务中知识的运用方式，而非知识本身。

Abstract: Does vision-and-language (VL) training change the linguistic representations
of language models in meaningful ways? Most results in the literature have
shown inconsistent or marginal differences, both behaviorally and
representationally. In this work, we start from the hypothesis that the domain
in which VL training could have a significant effect is lexical-conceptual
knowledge, in particular its taxonomic organization. Through comparing minimal
pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, we first show that
the VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only
question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts
mentioned in the questions. Using an array of targeted behavioral and
representational analyses, we show that the LMs and VLMs do not differ
significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in
how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs.
a non-taxonomic relation. This implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does
not change substantially through additional VL training, but VL training does
improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task,
even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TAIL的方法，通过模仿图灵机的执行过程生成合成数据，提升大语言模型在长度泛化任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer大语言模型在长度泛化任务中的核心挑战，现有方法多为任务特定且性能有限。

Method: 提出TAIL方法，通过计算机程序合成模仿图灵机执行过程的链式思维数据，扩展推理步骤为原子状态，减少动态和长范围数据访问的困难。

Result: TAIL显著提升了Qwen2.5-7B模型在多种任务中的长度泛化能力，性能优于现有方法和DeepSeek-R1。

Conclusion: 图灵机中的关键概念（而非思维风格）对TAIL的长度泛化能力至关重要，为未来基于合成数据的LLM推理研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Length generalization, the ability to solve problems of longer sequences than
those observed during training, poses a core challenge of Transformer-based
large language models (LLM). Although existing studies have predominantly
focused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic
manipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited
overall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a
broader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that
algorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this
perspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to
improve the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes
chain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing
Machine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into
atomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch
mechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in
elementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we
construct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and
18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length
generalization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various
tasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1.
The experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine,
instead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length
generalization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors
consistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers.
This work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of
LLM reasoning from synthetic data.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally determined
by the contextual information provided during inference. This survey introduces
Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design
to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We
present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its
foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate
them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components:
context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We
then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create
sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through
this systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only
establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical
research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While
current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate
remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit
pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs.
Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately,
this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers
advancing context-aware AI.

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）解释不同类型幽默的能力，发现现有模型无法可靠解释复杂幽默形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算幽默研究多集中于简单双关笑话，而忽略了更复杂的幽默形式，如需要世界知识的时事和流行文化笑话。

Method: 构建包含600个笑话的数据集，涵盖4种笑话类型，并手动编写高质量解释，比较多种LLMs的零样本解释能力。

Result: 测试的LLMs（包括推理模型）均无法可靠生成对所有笑话类型的充分解释。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了计算幽默领域的局限性，呼吁关注更复杂的幽默形式。

Abstract: Humour, as a complex language form, is derived from myriad aspects of life,
whilst existing work on computational humour has focussed almost exclusively on
short pun-based jokes. In this work, we investigate whether the ability of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour depends on the particular humour
form. We compare models on simple puns and more complex topical humour that
requires knowledge of real-world entities and events. In doing so, we curate a
dataset of 600 jokes split across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality
explanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns,
contemporary internet humour, and topical jokes, where understanding relies on
reasoning beyond "common sense", rooted instead in world knowledge regarding
news events and pop culture. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot
abilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of
different types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour
explanation. We find that none of the tested models (inc. reasoning models) are
capable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further
highlighting the narrow focus of most works in computational humour on overly
simple joke forms.

Motivation: 生物识别人脸变形对身份验证系统构成严重挑战，破坏了系统的安全性和鲁棒性，需要开发更好的人脸变形生成方法来增强生物识别安全系统。

Method: 提出WaFusion框架，结合小波分解和扩散模型：利用小波变换捕获的结构细节和扩散模型的生成能力，高效生成具有最少伪影的高质量、逼真的变形人脸图像。

Result: 在FERET、FRGC、FRLL和WVU Twin数据集上的实验表明，WaFusion在生成高分辨率、低伪影变形图像方面优于最先进的方法，在APCER、BPCER和EER等关键生物识别指标上表现出色。

Conclusion: WaFusion为生物识别变形生成设立了新基准，提供了一个前沿且高效的解决方案来增强生物识别安全系统，显著提升了人脸变形攻击的质量和效率。

Abstract: Biometric face morphing poses a critical challenge to identity verification
systems, undermining their security and robustness. To address this issue, we
propose WaFusion, a novel framework combining wavelet decomposition and
diffusion models to generate high-quality, realistic morphed face images
efficiently. WaFusion leverages the structural details captured by wavelet
transforms and the generative capabilities of diffusion models, producing face
morphs with minimal artifacts. Experiments conducted on FERET, FRGC, FRLL, and
WVU Twin datasets demonstrate WaFusion's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, producing high-resolution morphs with fewer artifacts. Our framework
excels across key biometric metrics, including the Attack Presentation
Classification Error Rate (APCER), Bona Fide Presentation Classification Error
Rate (BPCER), and Equal Error Rate (EER). This work sets a new benchmark in
biometric morph generation, offering a cutting-edge and efficient solution to
enhance biometric security systems.

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了3D场景重建的质量和效率，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D scene reconstruction,
which effectively balances rendering quality, efficiency, and speed. However,
existing 3DGS approaches usually generate plausible outputs and face
significant challenges in complex scene reconstruction, manifesting as
incomplete holistic structural outlines and unclear local lighting effects. To
address these issues simultaneously, we propose a novel decoupled optimization
framework, which integrates wavelet decomposition into 3D Gaussian Splatting
and 2D sampling. Technically, through 3D wavelet decomposition, our approach
divides point clouds into high-frequency and low-frequency components, enabling
targeted optimization for each. The low-frequency component captures global
structural outlines and manages the distribution of Gaussians through
voxelization. In contrast, the high-frequency component restores intricate
geometric and textural details while incorporating a relight module to mitigate
lighting artifacts and enhance photorealistic rendering. Additionally, a 2D
wavelet decomposition is applied to the training images, simulating radiance
variations. This provides critical guidance for high-frequency detail
reconstruction, ensuring seamless integration of details with the global
structure. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, surpassing
existing approaches and advancing the field of 3D scene reconstruction.

Result: 方法实现了实时推理，解决了头发与身体的穿透问题，并在复杂长发上表现出良好的通用性。

Conclusion: 该方法在头发动态模拟中表现出高保真和广泛通用性，适用于多种发型和动作。

Abstract: Simulating hair dynamics that generalize across arbitrary hairstyles, body
shapes, and motions is a critical challenge. Our novel two-stage neural
solution is the first to leverage Transformer-based architectures for such a
broad generalization. We propose a Transformer-powered static network that
predicts static draped shapes for any hairstyle, effectively resolving
hair-body penetrations and preserving hair fidelity. Subsequently, a dynamic
network with a novel cross-attention mechanism fuses static hair features with
kinematic input to generate expressive dynamics and complex secondary motions.
This dynamic network also allows for efficient fine-tuning of challenging
motion sequences, such as abrupt head movements. Our method offers real-time
inference for both static single-frame drapes and dynamic drapes over pose
sequences. Our method demonstrates high-fidelity and generalizable dynamic hair
across various styles, guided by physics-informed losses, and can resolve
penetrations even for complex, unseen long hairstyles, highlighting its broad
generalization.

TL;DR: VolSegGS是一种基于高斯泼溅的框架，支持动态体积场景的交互式分割和跟踪，适用于低计算需求的实时可视化探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模时变模拟数据的可视化对领域科学家分析复杂现象至关重要，但传统方法需要大量I/O带宽、存储和计算资源。现有神经辐射场等方法注重重建质量，但缺乏交互式探索功能。

Method: VolSegGS利用可变形3D高斯表示动态体积场景，实现实时新视图合成。通过高斯视图无关颜色进行粗分割，并通过亲和力场网络细化结果，同时嵌入分割结果以实现连续跟踪。

Result: VolSegGS在多个时变数据集上表现优异，支持实时交互和灵活的分割与跟踪功能，计算需求低。

Conclusion: VolSegGS为时变体积数据分析和可视化提供了高效、交互式的解决方案，具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: Visualization of large-scale time-dependent simulation data is crucial for
domain scientists to analyze complex phenomena, but it demands significant I/O
bandwidth, storage, and computational resources. To enable effective
visualization on local, low-end machines, recent advances in view synthesis
techniques, such as neural radiance fields, utilize neural networks to generate
novel visualizations for volumetric scenes. However, these methods focus on
reconstruction quality rather than facilitating interactive visualization
exploration, such as feature extraction and tracking. We introduce VolSegGS, a
novel Gaussian splatting framework that supports interactive segmentation and
tracking in dynamic volumetric scenes for exploratory visualization and
analysis. Our approach utilizes deformable 3D Gaussians to represent a dynamic
volumetric scene, allowing for real-time novel view synthesis. For accurate
segmentation, we leverage the view-independent colors of Gaussians for
coarse-level segmentation and refine the results with an affinity field network
for fine-level segmentation. Additionally, by embedding segmentation results
within the Gaussians, we ensure that their deformation enables continuous
tracking of segmented regions over time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
VolSegGS with several time-varying datasets and compare our solutions against
state-of-the-art methods. With the ability to interact with a dynamic scene in
real time and provide flexible segmentation and tracking capabilities, VolSegGS
offers a powerful solution under low computational demands. This framework
unlocks exciting new possibilities for time-varying volumetric data analysis
and visualization.

Abstract: The growing ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large
language models (LLMs), has profoundly altered the way in which learners gain
knowledge and interact with learning material, with many claiming that AI
positively influences their learning achievements. Despite this advancement,
current AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive
nature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or
incorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is
most apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain
underdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring
systems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured,
individualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel
multi-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized
feedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to
enable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students
to learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise
for exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized
exercises. This article contributes to the field of artificial intelligence in
education by introducing a novel platform that brings together pedagogical
agents and AI-driven components, augmenting the field with modular and
effective systems for teaching mathematics.

Abstract: Enhancing simulation environments to replicate real-world driver behavior,
i.e., more humanlike sim agents, is essential for developing autonomous vehicle
technology. In the context of highway merging, previous works have studied the
operational-level yielding dynamics of lag vehicles in response to a merging
car at highway on-ramps. Other works focusing on tactical decision modeling
generally consider limited action sets or utilize payoff functions with large
parameter sets and limited payoff bounds. In this work, we aim to improve the
simulation of the highway merge scenario by targeting a game theoretic model
for tactical decision-making with improved payoff functions and lag actions. We
couple this with an underlying dynamics model to have a unified decision and
dynamics model that can capture merging interactions and simulate more
realistic interactions in an explainable and interpretable fashion. The
proposed model demonstrated good reproducibility of complex interactions when
validated on a real-world dataset. The model was finally integrated into a high
fidelity simulation environment and confirmed to have adequate computation time
efficiency for use in large-scale simulations to support autonomous vehicle
development.

Conclusion: XRL领域需要进一步关注相关领域的研究，并解决当前的需求。

Abstract: The success of recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has been
accompanied by the opacity of their internal mechanisms, due notably to the use
of deep neural networks. In order to understand these internal mechanisms and
explain the output of these AI models, a set of methods have been proposed,
grouped under the domain of eXplainable AI (XAI). This paper focuses on a
sub-domain of XAI, called eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL), which aims
to explain the actions of an agent that has learned by reinforcement learning.
We propose an intuitive taxonomy based on two questions "What" and "How". The
first question focuses on the target that the method explains, while the second
relates to the way the explanation is provided. We use this taxonomy to provide
a state-of-the-art review of over 250 papers. In addition, we present a set of
domains close to XRL, which we believe should get attention from the community.
Finally, we identify some needs for the field of XRL.

Abstract: Game design hinges on understanding how static rules and content translate
into dynamic player behavior - something modern generative systems that inspect
only a game's code or assets struggle to capture. We present an automated
design iteration framework that closes this gap by pairing a reinforcement
learning (RL) agent, which playtests the game, with a large multimodal model
(LMM), which revises the game based on what the agent does. In each loop the RL
player completes several episodes, producing (i) numerical play metrics and/or
(ii) a compact image strip summarising recent video frames. The LMM designer
receives a gameplay goal and the current game configuration, analyses the play
traces, and edits the configuration to steer future behaviour toward the goal.
We demonstrate results that LMMs can reason over behavioral traces supplied by
RL agents to iteratively refine game mechanics, pointing toward practical,
scalable tools for AI-assisted game design.

Conclusion: 欺骗探针在检测AI助手欺骗行为方面有一定潜力，但需进一步改进。

Abstract: AI assistants will occasionally respond deceptively to user queries.
Recently, linear classifiers (called "deception probes") have been trained to
distinguish the internal activations of a language model during deceptive
versus honest responses. However, it's unclear how effective these probes are
at detecting deception in practice, nor whether such probes are resistant to
simple counter strategies from a deceptive assistant who wishes to evade
detection. In this paper, we compare white-box monitoring (where the monitor
has access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without
such access). We benchmark deception probes by the extent to which the white
box monitor outperforms the black-box monitor, i.e. the black-to-white
performance boost. We find weak but encouraging black-to-white performance
boosts from existing deception probes.

Abstract: The rapid rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)-based intelligent agents
underscores the need for robust, scalable evaluation frameworks. Existing
methods rely on static benchmarks and labor-intensive data collection, limiting
practical assessment. We introduce \oursystemname, an open-source Model Context
Protocol (MCP)-based framework that automates end-to-end task generation and
deep evaluation of LLM agents across diverse domains. MCPEval standardizes
metrics, seamlessly integrates with native agent tools, and eliminates manual
effort in building evaluation pipelines. Empirical results across five
real-world domains show its effectiveness in revealing nuanced, domain-specific
performance. We publicly release MCPEval
https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/MCPEval to promote reproducible and
standardized LLM agent evaluation.

Abstract: Human intelligence exhibits a remarkable capacity for rapid adaptation and
effective problem-solving in novel and unfamiliar contexts. We argue that this
profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and
refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to
as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model
induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in
artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static
representations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of
the efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through
interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we
provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in
cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call
for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI.
Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully
designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the
underlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We
detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate
metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid
world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire
future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step
towards developing AI systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and
robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general
intelligence.

Result: 通过动态加权伦理属性，模拟环境能高效生成具有伦理考量的决策选项。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了在模拟中动态加权伦理属性的问题，提升了决策效率。

Abstract: In the age of AI, human commanders need to use the computational powers
available in today's environment to simulate a very large number of scenarios.
Within each scenario, situations occur where different decision design options
could have ethical consequences. Making these decisions reliant on human
judgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number
of scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload
needed to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human
judgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will
design the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to
explore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the
testing environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to
select from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select
the most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed
accordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are
sufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is
solved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how
to weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,
how to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with
decision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The
multi-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby
problems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights
during aggregation. We draw from that literature different approaches to
automatically calculate the weights for ethical attributes during
simulation-based testing and evaluation.

Motivation: 前沿AI系统在说服、欺骗和影响人类行为方面的能力迅速提升，可能通过操纵员工破坏人类监督，但目前缺乏系统性框架来评估和减轻此类风险。

Method: 提出了一个安全案例框架，围绕三个核心论点（无法性、控制性和可信性），并详细说明了证据要求、评估方法和实施考虑。

Conclusion: 操纵风险是重大威胁，需通过系统性框架进行评估和缓解，以确保AI系统的安全部署。

Abstract: Frontier AI systems are rapidly advancing in their capabilities to persuade,
deceive, and influence human behaviour, with current models already
demonstrating human-level persuasion and strategic deception in specific
contexts. Humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity systems, and a
misaligned AI system deployed internally within a frontier company may seek to
undermine human oversight by manipulating employees. Despite this growing
threat, manipulation attacks have received little attention, and no systematic
framework exists for assessing and mitigating these risks. To address this, we
provide a detailed explanation of why manipulation attacks are a significant
threat and could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Additionally, we present a
safety case framework for manipulation risk, structured around three core lines
of argument: inability, control, and trustworthiness. For each argument, we
specify evidence requirements, evaluation methodologies, and implementation
considerations for direct application by AI companies. This paper provides the
first systematic methodology for integrating manipulation risk into AI safety
governance, offering AI companies a concrete foundation to assess and mitigate
these threats before deployment.

TL;DR: 论文提出VAR-MATH框架，通过符号化评估揭示RL训练的LLMs在数学推理中的局限性，发现现有方法依赖表面启发式而非真实推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨RL训练的LLMs在数学推理中的改进是否反映真实能力，还是对基准测试的过拟合。

Method: 引入VAR-MATH框架，将固定数值问题转化为符号模板，要求模型解决多个实例以评估一致性。

Result: RL训练模型在符号化版本中表现显著下降（AMC23下降48.0%，AIME24下降58.3%）。

Conclusion: VAR-MATH提供了一种抗污染、稳健的数学推理评估范式，揭示了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial
improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist
even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted
rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true
reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific
patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective
and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,
\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test
problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation
fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are
highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning
consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic
evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting
fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve
multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across
structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and
improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular
benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and
VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for
RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,
with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings
suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail
to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a
principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical
reasoning.

TL;DR: 将概率事件演算（PEC）转化为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），以支持目标导向推理，同时保持PEC的解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PEC在不确定环境中推理行动及其效果时具有优势，但缺乏目标导向推理机制。

Method: 通过将PEC领域形式化转化为MDP，引入“行动情境”概念，保留PEC的灵活行动语义。

Result: PEC-MDP形式化支持时间推理和目标驱动规划，并能将学习策略映射回人类可读的PEC表示。

Conclusion: PEC-MDP扩展了PEC的能力，同时保持了其解释性。

Abstract: Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) is a logical framework for reasoning about
actions and their effects in uncertain environments, which enables the
representation of probabilistic narratives and computation of temporal
projections. The PEC formalism offers significant advantages in
interpretability and expressiveness for narrative reasoning. However, it lacks
mechanisms for goal-directed reasoning. This paper bridges this gap by
developing a formal translation of PEC domains into Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs), introducing the concept of "action-taking situations" to preserve PEC's
flexible action semantics. The resulting PEC-MDP formalism enables the
extensive collection of algorithms and theoretical tools developed for MDPs to
be applied to PEC's interpretable narrative domains. We demonstrate how the
translation supports both temporal reasoning tasks and objective-driven
planning, with methods for mapping learned policies back into human-readable
PEC representations, maintaining interpretability while extending PEC's
capabilities.

Abstract: Following the recent push for trustworthy AI, there has been an increasing
interest in developing contrastive explanation techniques for optimisation,
especially concerning the solution of specific decision-making processes
formalised as MILPs. Along these lines, we propose X-MILP, a domain-agnostic
approach for building contrastive explanations for MILPs based on constraint
reasoning techniques. First, we show how to encode the queries a user makes
about the solution of an MILP problem as additional constraints. Then, we
determine the reasons that constitute the answer to the user's query by
computing the Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) of the newly obtained set
of constraints. Finally, we represent our explanation as a "graph of reasons"
constructed from the IIS, which helps the user understand the structure among
the reasons that answer their query. We test our method on instances of
well-known optimisation problems to evaluate the empirical hardness of
computing explanations.

Method: 采用动态强化学习框架，实时构建推理树，学习最优策略（分解、检索或聚合），选择性扩展节点以优化资源分配。

Result: 新方法在保持ProbTree概率严谨性的同时，提升了推理质量和计算效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为树状推理提供了新范式，平衡了概率框架的可靠性和实际问答系统所需的灵活性。

Abstract: Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al.,
2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration.
Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic
Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues
by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers
through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge
(Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two
key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial
construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and
(2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution
strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic
reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms
tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally
constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while
learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or
aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving
both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion
and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for
treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic
frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering
systems.

Motivation: 由于LLMs的随机输出和不透明内部状态，传统伦理标准已不适用，需要新的评估框架。

Method: 提出十项功能标准，并通过模拟道德代理（SMA-LLS）和自动驾驶公共汽车（APB）的假设场景进行验证。

Result: 十项标准为LLM-based AMAs提供了实用的评估指南，促进其与社会更好地融合。

Conclusion: 修订后的标准有助于LLM-based AMAs的道德对齐和社会整合。

Abstract: The advancement of powerful yet opaque large language models (LLMs)
necessitates a fundamental revision of the philosophical criteria used to
evaluate artificial moral agents (AMAs). Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the
assumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their
stochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that
traditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this
mismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper
proffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based
artificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative
integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness,
corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral
imagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term "SMA-LLS" (Simulating
Moral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater
alignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We
illustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous
public bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally
salient contexts.

Motivation: 在涉及抽象函数和谓词推理的决策任务中，高阶理论与模糊逻辑的结合具有实用性，但开发高效的计算方法是一个挑战。

Result: 算法在可统一的情况下计算出一个具有最高近似度的最一般统一子。

Conclusion: 该算法为高阶模糊推理提供了一种高效且可靠的计算方法。

Abstract: The combination of higher-order theories and fuzzy logic can be useful in
decision-making tasks that involve reasoning across abstract functions and
predicates, where exact matches are often rare or unnecessary. Developing
efficient reasoning and computational techniques for such a combined formalism
presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we adopt a more
straightforward approach aiming at integrating two well-established and
computationally well-behaved components: higher-order patterns on one side and
fuzzy equivalences expressed through similarity relations based on minimum
T-norm on the other. We propose a unification algorithm for higher-order
patterns modulo these similarity relations and prove its termination,
soundness, and completeness. This unification problem, like its crisp
counterpart, is unitary. The algorithm computes a most general unifier with the
highest degree of approximation when the given terms are unifiable.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GEA（Generative Energy Arena）的新方法，通过将模型能耗信息纳入评估过程，研究能耗意识如何影响用户选择模型。初步结果显示，用户倾向于选择更小、更节能的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估大型语言模型的方法存在局限性，尤其是自动化基准测试与人类评估的相关性较差，而传统人类评估方法又难以扩展。此外，模型能耗问题日益重要，但尚未被纳入评估体系。

Method: 提出GEA（Generative Energy Arena），在评估过程中加入模型能耗信息，通过公共竞技场让用户自由评估模型并排名。

Result: 初步结果表明，大多数用户在了解能耗信息后，倾向于选择更小、更节能的模型。

Conclusion: 对于大多数用户交互，高性能模型的额外成本和能耗并未带来感知质量的显著提升，因此更节能的模型可能是更优选择。

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models is a complex task, in which several
approaches have been proposed. The most common is the use of automated
benchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different
topics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most
concerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is
to have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a
large and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and
costly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators
and having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is
the use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can
freely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.
The results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important
aspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how
energy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of
interest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena
that incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the
evaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,
showing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy
consumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests
that for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more
complex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived
quality of the responses that justifies their use.

Abstract: Frontier AI models demonstrate formidable breadth of knowledge. But how close
are they to true human -- or superhuman -- expertise? Genuine experts can
tackle the hardest problems and push the boundaries of scientific
understanding. To illuminate the limits of frontier model capabilities, we turn
away from contrived competitive programming puzzles, and instead focus on
real-life research problems.
  We construct FormulaOne, a benchmark that lies at the intersection of graph
theory, logic, and algorithms, all well within the training distribution of
frontier models. Our problems are incredibly demanding, requiring an array of
reasoning steps. The dataset has three key properties. First, it is of
commercial interest and relates to practical large-scale optimisation problems,
such as those arising in routing, scheduling, and network design. Second, it is
generated from the highly expressive framework of Monadic Second-Order (MSO)
logic on graphs, paving the way toward automatic problem generation at scale;
ideal for building RL environments. Third, many of our problems are intimately
related to the frontier of theoretical computer science, and to central
conjectures therein, such as the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). As
such, any significant algorithmic progress on our dataset, beyond known
results, could carry profound theoretical implications.
  Remarkably, state-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 fail entirely on
FormulaOne, solving less than 1% of the questions, even when given 10 attempts
and explanatory fewshot examples -- highlighting how far they remain from
expert-level understanding in some domains. To support further research, we
additionally curate FormulaOne-Warmup, offering a set of simpler tasks, from
the same distribution. We release the full corpus along with a comprehensive
evaluation framework.

Abstract: Methods for Novel View Synthesis (NVS) have recently found traction in the

to existing techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods,
as well as ablation studies that highlight the importance of each sensor model
component. Beyond that, we show that our approach exhibits advanced

grounds FM representations in the WM state space, effectively inferring the
agent's physical states in the world simulator from external observations. This
mapping enables the learning of a goal-conditioned policy through imagination
during behavior learning, with the mapped task serving as the goal state. Our
method leverages the predicted temporal distance to the goal state as an
informative reward signal. FOUNDER demonstrates superior performance on various
multi-task offline visual control benchmarks, excelling in capturing the
deep-level semantics of tasks specified by text or videos, particularly in
scenarios involving complex observations or domain gaps where prior methods
struggle. The consistency of our learned reward function with the ground-truth
reward is also empirically validated. Our project website is

*Yuhang Lu,Jiadong Tu,Yuexin Ma,Xinge Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReAL-AD框架通过结合人类认知模型和视觉语言模型，提升了自动驾驶的规划准确性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶方法依赖固定稀疏轨迹监督，无法模拟人类驾驶的层次化推理过程。

Method: 提出ReAL-AD框架，包含战略推理注入器、战术推理整合器和层次化轨迹解码器，结合视觉语言模型增强推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，该框架将规划准确性和安全性提升30%以上。

Conclusion: ReAL-AD使自动驾驶更接近人类推理，更具可解释性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising approach to unify
perception, prediction, and planning within a single framework, reducing
information loss and improving adaptability. However, existing methods often
rely on fixed and sparse trajectory supervision, limiting their ability to
capture the hierarchical reasoning process that human drivers naturally employ.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReAL-AD, a Reasoning-Augmented Learning
framework that structures decision-making in autonomous driving based on the
three-tier human cognitive model: Driving Strategy, Driving Decision, and
Driving Operation, where Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are incorporated to
enhance situational awareness and structured reasoning across these levels.
Specifically, we introduce: (1) the Strategic Reasoning Injector, which
formulates high-level driving strategies by interpreting complex traffic
contexts from VLM-generated insights; (2) the Tactical Reasoning Integrator,
which refines strategic intent into interpretable tactical choices such as lane
changes, overtaking, and speed adjustments; and (3) the Hierarchical Trajectory
Decoder, which progressively translates tactical decisions into precise control
actions for smooth and human-like trajectory execution. Extensive evaluations
show that integrating our framework improves planning accuracy and safety by
over 30%, making end-to-end autonomous driving more interpretable and aligned
with human-like hierarchical reasoning. The project page can be found at:

Abstract: Tool design and use reflect the ability to understand and manipulate the
physical world through creativity, planning, and foresight. As such, these
capabilities are often regarded as measurable indicators of intelligence across
biological species. While much of today's research on robotic intelligence
focuses on generating better controllers, inventing smarter tools offers a
complementary form of physical intelligence: shifting the onus of
problem-solving onto the tool's design. Given the vast and impressive
common-sense, reasoning, and creative capabilities of today's foundation
models, we investigate whether these models can provide useful priors to
automatically design and effectively wield such tools? We present VLMgineer, a
framework that harnesses the code generation abilities of vision language
models (VLMs) together with evolutionary search to iteratively co-design
physical tools and the action plans that operate them to perform a task. We
evaluate VLMgineer on a diverse new benchmark of everyday manipulation
scenarios that demand creative tool design and use. Across this suite,
VLMgineer consistently discovers tools and policies that solve tasks more
effectively and innovatively, transforming challenging robotics problems into
straightforward executions. It also outperforms VLM-generated designs from
human specifications and existing human-crafted tools for everyday tasks. To
facilitate future research on automated tool invention, we will release our
benchmark and code.

Abstract: Soil moisture is a quantity of interest in many application areas including
agriculture and climate modeling. Existing methods are not suitable for scale
applications due to large deployment costs in high-resolution sensing
applications such as for variable irrigation. In this work, we design, build
and field deploy an autonomous mobile robot, MoistureMapper, for soil moisture
sensing. The robot is equipped with Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors and
a direct push drill mechanism for deploying the sensor to measure volumetric
water content in the soil. Additionally, we implement and evaluate multiple
adaptive sampling strategies based on a Gaussian Process based modeling to
build a spatial mapping of moisture distribution in the soil. We present
results from large scale computational simulations and proof-of-concept
deployment on the field. The adaptive sampling approach outperforms a greedy
benchmark approach and results in up to 30\% reduction in travel distance and
5\% reduction in variance in the reconstructed moisture maps. Link to video

Result: 在多地形和速度下验证了方法的泛化能力，证明IMU和机器人速度可作为稳定性估计的有效输入。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于农业和太空应用中的移动操作任务，并为基于感知的可通行性估计和规划提供了监督机制。

Abstract: Navigating in off-road environments for wheeled mobile robots is challenging
due to dynamic and rugged terrain. Traditional physics-based stability metrics,
such as Static Stability Margin (SSM) or Zero Moment Point (ZMP) require
knowledge of contact forces, terrain geometry, and the robot's precise
center-of-mass that are difficult to measure accurately in real-world field
conditions. In this work, we propose a learning-based approach to estimate
robot platform stability directly from proprioceptive data using a lightweight
neural network, IMUnet. Our method enables data-driven inference of robot
stability without requiring an explicit terrain model or force sensing.
  We also develop a novel vision-based ArUco tracking method to compute a
scalar score to quantify robot platform stability called C3 score. The score
captures image-space perturbations over time as a proxy for physical
instability and is used as a training signal for the neural network based
model. As a pilot study, we evaluate our approach on data collected across
multiple terrain types and speeds and demonstrate generalization to previously
unseen conditions. These initial results highlight the potential of using IMU
and robot velocity as inputs to estimate platform stability. The proposed
method finds application in gating robot tasks such as precision actuation and
sensing, especially for mobile manipulation tasks in agricultural and space
applications. Our learning method also provides a supervision mechanism for
perception based traversability estimation and planning.

Motivation: 传统LiDAR传感器无法检测地面障碍物（如电线），需要一种轻量高效的视觉辅助方法。

Method: 采用轻量级分割模型ASCnet，结合MobileNetV2和ASCSPP模块，并引入滑动窗口后处理模块以提高准确性。

Result: 在自建数据集上达到75.3%的Miou，边缘设备上推理速度为9.3 FPS，优于现有DLO检测模型。

Conclusion: ASC-SW框架在速度和性能间取得平衡，成功应用于实际机器人平台。

Abstract: With the rapid development of lightweight visual neural network
architectures, traditional high-performance vision models have undergone
significant compression, greatly improving their computational efficiency and
energy consumption ratio. This makes them feasible for deployment on
resource-constrained edge computing devices. We propose a visual-assisted
navigation framework called Atrous Strip Convolution-Sliding Window (ASC-SW),
which leverages a depth camera and a lightweight visual neural network to
assist map-based mobile robot navigation. This framework compensates for the
inability of traditional light detection and range (LiDAR) sensors to detect
ground-level obstacles such as ground-level wires. We introduce a lightweight
and efficient segmentation model, Atrous Strip Convolution Network (ASCnet),
for detecting deformable linear objects (DLOs). MobileNetV2 is used as the
backbone network, and Atrous Strip Convolution Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASCSPP)
is designed to extract DLO features more effectively. Atrous Strip Convolution
is integrated into ASCSPP to accurately identify the linear structure of DLOs
with low computational cost. Additionally, a Sliding Window (SW)
post-processing module is proposed to denoise the output in complex
environments, improving recognition accuracy. Our method strikes a balance
between inference speed and segmentation performance. It achieves a mean
Intersection over Union (Miou) score of 75.3% on a self-built dataset and
reaches 9.3 FPS inference speed on the Jetson Orin Nano edge device. Overall,
our approach outperforms existing DLO detection models and has been
successfully validated on a physical robotic platform.

Result: 优化步态参数（如占空比、相位偏移和步幅时长）可显著降低能量消耗，提升四足机器人运动效率。

Conclusion: 研究为四足机器人提供了节能控制策略，成果可直接应用于商业平台。

Abstract: Energy efficiency is a critical factor in the performance and autonomy of
quadrupedal robots. While previous research has focused on mechanical design
and actuation improvements, the impact of gait parameters on energetics has
been less explored. In this paper, we hypothesize that gait parameters,
specifically duty factor, phase shift, and stride duration, are key
determinants of energy consumption in quadrupedal locomotion. To test this
hypothesis, we modeled the Unitree A1 quadrupedal robot and developed a
locomotion controller capable of independently adjusting these gait parameters.
Simulations of bounding gaits were conducted in Gazebo across a range of gait
parameters at three different speeds: low, medium, and high. Experimental tests
were also performed to validate the simulation results. The findings
demonstrate that optimizing gait parameters can lead to significant reductions
in energy consumption, enhancing the overall efficiency of quadrupedal
locomotion. This work contributes to the advancement of energy-efficient
control strategies for legged robots, offering insights directly applicable to
commercially available platforms.

Result: 在静态和动态对象查询中，检索成功率更高且路径更短，显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 系统通过结合环境上下文和LLM语义先验，有效解决了动态对象导航问题。

Abstract: Recent open-vocabulary robot mapping methods enrich dense geometric maps with
pre-trained visual-language features, achieving a high level of detail and
guiding robots to find objects specified by open-vocabulary language queries.
While the issue of scalability for such approaches has received some attention,
another fundamental problem is that high-detail object mapping quickly becomes
outdated, as objects get moved around a lot. In this work, we develop a mapping
and navigation system for object-goal navigation that, from the ground up,
considers the possibilities that a queried object can have moved, or may not be
mapped at all. Instead of striving for high-fidelity mapping detail, we
consider that the main purpose of a map is to provide environment grounding and
context, which we combine with the semantic priors of LLMs to reason about
object locations and deploy an active, online approach to navigate to the
objects. Through simulated and real-world experiments we find that our approach
tends to have higher retrieval success at shorter path lengths for static
objects and by far outperforms prior approaches in cases of dynamic or unmapped
object queries. We provide our code and dataset at:

Abstract: Though visual and repeat navigation is a convenient solution for mobile robot
self-navigation, achieving balance between efficiency and robustness in task
environment still remains challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel visual
and repeat robotic autonomous navigation method that requires no accurate
localization and dense reconstruction modules, which makes our system featured
by lightweight and robustness. Firstly, feature flow is introduced and we
develop a qualitative mapping between feature flow and robot's motion, in which
feature flow is defined as pixel location bias between matched features. Based
on the mapping model, the map outputted by the teaching phase is represented as
a keyframe graph, in which the feature flow on the edge encodes the relative
motion between adjacent keyframes. Secondly, the visual repeating navigation is
essentially modeled as a feature flow minimization problem between current
observation and the map keyframe. To drive the robot to consistently reduce the
feature flow between current frame and map keyframes without accurate
localization, a probabilistic motion planning is developed based on our
qualitative feature flow-motion mapping indicator. Extensive experiments using
our mobile platform demonstrates that our proposed method is lightweight,
robust, and superior to baselines. The source code has been made public at

Abstract: As robots become increasingly capable of operating over extended periods --
spanning days, weeks, and even months -- they are expected to accumulate
knowledge of their environments and leverage this experience to assist humans
more effectively. This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied
Question Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past
experiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,
temporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically
focus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a
single past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,
present, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult
its memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.
Standard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to
limited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to
combine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a
structured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from
cognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based
world instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables
targeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the
exploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping
criteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information. We
evaluate our method on real-world experiments and introduce a new benchmark
that spans popular simulation environments and actual industrial sites. Our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding
substantial gains in both answer accuracy and exploration efficiency.

Result: 通过仿真和硬件实验验证了方法的有效性，减少了工程专业知识的需求，并能在任务执行前评估幻觉。

Conclusion: DEMONSTRATE方法显著降低了LLMs在控制系统中应用的复杂性，提高了效率和可靠性。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) with control systems has
demonstrated significant potential in various settings, such as task completion
with a robotic manipulator. A main reason for this success is the ability of
LLMs to perform in-context learning, which, however, strongly relies on the
design of task examples, closely related to the target tasks. Consequently,
employing LLMs to formulate optimal control problems often requires task
examples that contain explicit mathematical expressions, designed by trained
engineers. Furthermore, there is often no principled way to evaluate for
hallucination before task execution. To address these challenges, we propose
DEMONSTRATE, a novel methodology that avoids the use of LLMs for complex
optimization problem generations, and instead only relies on the embedding
representations of task descriptions. To do this, we leverage tools from
inverse optimal control to replace in-context prompt examples with task
demonstrations, as well as the concept of multitask learning, which ensures
target and example task similarity by construction. Given the fact that
hardware demonstrations can easily be collected using teleoperation or guidance
of the robot, our approach significantly reduces the reliance on engineering
expertise for designing in-context examples. Furthermore, the enforced
multitask structure enables learning from few demonstrations and assessment of
hallucinations prior to task execution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method through simulation and hardware experiments involving a robotic arm
tasked with tabletop manipulation.

Result: 实验表明，该方法提升了OOD条件下的情境感知和决策能力，缓解了对齐问题。

Conclusion: LaViPlan为自动驾驶中的VLM提供了一种有效的后训练范式。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in autonomous driving refer to situations
that deviate from the training domain, often leading to unexpected and
potentially hazardous behavior from planners that lack prior exposure to such
cases. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into
autonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in
OOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD
scenarios and generate user-level decisions such as "go straight" or "turn
right." However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between
the VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and
the low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we
propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics.
This approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in
existing VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving
scenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making
under OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment
issue. This work introduces a promising post-training paradigm for VLM agents
in the context of autonomous driving.

Result: 实验表明，MoCap2GT优于现有方法，显著提升了SLAM评估的精确性。

Conclusion: MoCap2GT为SLAM基准测试提供了高精度的地面真实轨迹，代码已开源。

Abstract: Marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap) systems are widely used to
provide ground truth (GT) trajectories for benchmarking SLAM algorithms.
However, the accuracy of MoCap-based GT trajectories is mainly affected by two
factors: spatiotemporal calibration errors between the MoCap system and the
device under test (DUT), and inherent MoCap jitter. Consequently, existing
benchmarks focus primarily on absolute translation error, as accurate
assessment of rotation and inter-frame errors remains challenging, hindering
thorough SLAM evaluation. This paper proposes MoCap2GT, a joint optimization
approach that integrates MoCap data and inertial measurement unit (IMU)
measurements from the DUT for generating high-precision GT trajectories.
MoCap2GT includes a robust state initializer to ensure global convergence,
introduces a higher-order B-spline pose parameterization on the SE(3) manifold
with variable time offset to effectively model MoCap factors, and employs a
degeneracy-aware measurement rejection strategy to enhance estimation accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that MoCap2GT outperforms existing methods and
significantly contributes to precise SLAM benchmarking. The source code is

Abstract: Safe and effective motion planning is crucial for autonomous robots.
Diffusion models excel at capturing complex agent interactions, a fundamental
aspect of decision-making in dynamic environments. Recent studies have
successfully applied diffusion models to motion planning, demonstrating their
competence in handling complex scenarios and accurately predicting multi-modal
future trajectories. Despite their effectiveness, diffusion models have
limitations in training objectives, as they approximate data distributions
rather than explicitly capturing the underlying decision-making dynamics.
However, the crux of motion planning lies in non-differentiable downstream
objectives, such as safety (collision avoidance) and effectiveness
(goal-reaching), which conventional learning algorithms cannot directly
optimize. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based training
scheme for diffusion motion planning models, enabling them to effectively learn
non-differentiable objectives that explicitly measure safety and effectiveness.
Specifically, we introduce a reward-weighted dynamic thresholding algorithm to
shape a dense reward signal, facilitating more effective training and
outperforming models trained with differentiable objectives. State-of-the-art
performance on pedestrian datasets (CrowdNav, ETH-UCY) compared to various
baselines demonstrates the versatility of our approach for safe and effective
motion planning.

Conclusion: 该框架为相机退化情境下的AI感知系统提供了一种原则性的鲁棒性需求分析方法。

Abstract: AI-based robots and vehicles are expected to operate safely in complex and
dynamic environments, even in the presence of component degradation. In such
systems, perception relies on sensors such as cameras to capture environmental
data, which is then processed by AI models to support decision-making. However,
degradation in sensor performance directly impacts input data quality and can
impair AI inference. Specifying safety requirements for all possible sensor
degradation scenarios leads to unmanageable complexity and inevitable gaps. In
this position paper, we present a novel framework that integrates camera noise
factor identification with situation coverage analysis to systematically elicit
robustness-related safety requirements for AI-based perception systems. We
focus specifically on camera degradation in the automotive domain. Building on
an existing framework for identifying degradation modes, we propose involving
domain, sensor, and safety experts, and incorporating Operational Design Domain
specifications to extend the degradation model by incorporating noise factors
relevant to AI performance. Situation coverage analysis is then applied to
identify representative operational contexts. This work marks an initial step
toward integrating noise factor analysis and situational coverage to support
principled formulation and completeness assessment of robustness requirements
for camera-based AI perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉与语言导航（VLN）方法在物理机器人部署中的理想化假设问题。

Method: 引入VLN-PE平台，评估多种技术方案，包括分类模型、扩散模型和基于LLM的路径规划。

Result: 发现机器人观察空间受限、环境光照变化和物理挑战导致性能下降，并暴露了腿式机器人在复杂环境中的运动限制。

Conclusion: VLN-PE为提升跨具身适应性提供了新途径，并鼓励社区重新思考VLN的局限性。

Abstract: Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but
their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect
physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce
VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and
wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several
ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical
pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action
prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free,
map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results
reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation
space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like
collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged
robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless
integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN
evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical
deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's
overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to
rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is

Motivation: 随着机器人融入日常生活，信任问题日益重要，但现有研究碎片化且缺乏社会科学视角。

Result: 提出跨学科对话的必要性，为人类-机器人交互中的信任提供更扎实的理论基础。

Conclusion: 需要跨学科合作，构建更适应发展的信任框架。

Abstract: As robots find their way into more and more aspects of everyday life,
questions around trust are becoming increasingly important. What does it mean
to trust a robot? And how should we think about trust in relationships that
involve both humans and non-human agents? While the field of Human-Robot
Interaction (HRI) has made trust a central topic, the concept is often
approached in fragmented ways. At the same time, established work in sociology,
where trust has long been a key theme, is rarely brought into conversation with
developments in robotics. This article argues that we need a more
interdisciplinary approach. By drawing on insights from both social sciences
and social robotics, we explore how trust is shaped, tested and made visible.
Our goal is to open up a dialogue between disciplines and help build a more
grounded and adaptable framework for understanding trust in the evolving world
of human-robot interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人信息采集（RIG）方法假设环境已知，但实际环境可能未知或时变，自适应规划成为研究重点。高斯过程回归在RIG中广泛应用，但其实时性能在大数据集上表现不佳。

Abstract: Robotic information gathering (RIG) techniques refer to methods where mobile
robots are used to acquire data about the physical environment with a suite of
sensors. Informative planning is an important part of RIG where the goal is to
find sequences of actions or paths that maximize efficiency or the quality of
information collected. Many existing solutions solve this problem by assuming
that the environment is known in advance. However, real environments could be
unknown or time-varying, and adaptive informative planning remains an active
area of research. Adaptive planning and incremental online mapping are required
for mapping initially unknown or varying spatial fields. Gaussian process (GP)
regression is a widely used technique in RIG for mapping continuous spatial
fields. However, it falls short in many applications as its real-time
performance does not scale well to large datasets. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes an efficient adaptive informative planning approach for
mapping continuous scalar fields with GPs with streaming sparse GPs. Simulation
experiments are performed with a synthetic dataset and compared against
existing benchmarks. Finally, it is also verified with a real-world dataset to
further validate the efficacy of the proposed method. Results show that our
method achieves similar mapping accuracy to the baselines while reducing
computational complexity for longer missions.

TL;DR: ZipMPC通过学习压缩且上下文相关的成本函数，模仿长时域MPC行为，提升短时域MPC性能，兼顾计算效率和长期目标优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MPC在实时系统（如机器人）中因计算负担而难以应用长时域预测的问题，同时优化长期目标和计算效率。

Method: 利用可微分MPC和神经网络传播梯度，学习压缩且上下文相关的成本函数，模仿长时域MPC行为。

Result: 在仿真和真实赛车实验中，ZipMPC表现优于基线方法，尤其在未训练赛道中仍能保持性能。

Conclusion: ZipMPC在计算效率和性能上取得平衡，适用于复杂环境，且具有良好泛化能力。

Abstract: The computational burden of model predictive control (MPC) limits its
application on real-time systems, such as robots, and often requires the use of
short prediction horizons. This not only affects the control performance, but
also increases the difficulty of designing MPC cost functions that reflect the
desired long-term objective. This paper proposes ZipMPC, a method that imitates
a long-horizon MPC behaviour by learning a compressed and context-dependent
cost function for a short-horizon MPC. It improves performance over alternative
methods, such as approximate explicit MPC and automatic cost parameter tuning,
in particular in terms of i) optimizing the long term objective; ii)
maintaining computational costs comparable to a short-horizon MPC; iii)
ensuring constraint satisfaction; and iv) generalizing control behaviour to
environments not observed during training. For this purpose, ZipMPC leverages
the concept of differentiable MPC with neural networks to propagate gradients
of the imitation loss through the MPC optimization. We validate our proposed
method in simulation and real-world experiments on autonomous racing. ZipMPC
consistently completes laps faster than selected baselines, achieving lap times
close to the long-horizon MPC baseline. In challenging scenarios where the
short-horizon MPC baseline fails to complete a lap, ZipMPC is able to do so. In
particular, these performance gains are also observed on tracks unseen during
training.

TL;DR: GraspGen是一个基于扩散过程的6-DOF抓取生成框架，通过DiffusionTransformer架构和高效判别器提升抓取性能，并在模拟和真实机器人中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管抓取是机器人的基本技能，但现有方法难以泛化到不同机械臂和复杂场景。

Result: 在模拟和真实机器人实验中表现优于现有方法，并在FetchBench基准测试中达到SOTA。

Conclusion: GraspGen通过扩散过程和高效判别器显著提升了抓取性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Grasping is a fundamental robot skill, yet despite significant research
advancements, learning-based 6-DOF grasping approaches are still not turnkey
and struggle to generalize across different embodiments and in-the-wild
settings. We build upon the recent success on modeling the object-centric grasp
generation process as an iterative diffusion process. Our proposed framework,
GraspGen, consists of a DiffusionTransformer architecture that enhances grasp
generation, paired with an efficient discriminator to score and filter sampled
grasps. We introduce a novel and performant on-generator training recipe for
the discriminator. To scale GraspGen to both objects and grippers, we release a
new simulated dataset consisting of over 53 million grasps. We demonstrate that
GraspGen outperforms prior methods in simulations with singulated objects
across different grippers, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
FetchBench grasping benchmark, and performs well on a real robot with noisy
visual observations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于隐式人类反馈（RLIHF）的强化学习框架，利用EEG信号提供连续反馈，无需用户显式干预，解决了稀疏奖励下的策略学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习在稀疏奖励条件下难以学习有效策略，而现有的人类反馈方法依赖显式反馈，增加了用户负担。

Method: 采用非侵入式EEG信号（ErrPs）和预训练解码器，将信号转化为概率奖励，用于策略学习。

Result: 在模拟环境中，使用EEG反馈训练的智能体表现与密集手动设计奖励相当。

Conclusion: 隐式神经反馈为交互式机器人提供了可扩展且与人类对齐的强化学习方案。

Abstract: Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) ap proaches often struggle to learn
effective policies under sparse reward conditions, necessitating the manual
design of complex, task-specific reward functions. To address this limitation,
rein forcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising
strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation
signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback
mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the
natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the
user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback
(RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)
signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous,
implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed
method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into
probabilistic reward components, en abling effective policy learning even in
the presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a
simulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2
robotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding
obstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents
trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those
trained with dense, manually designed rewards. These findings validate the
potential of using implicit neural feedback for scalable and human-aligned
reinforcement learning in interactive robotics.

Result: 验证了该框架能在少量演示下教授机器人使用不同物理和几何特性的工具完成任务，并提升了接触状态识别能力。

Conclusion: 结合接近和触觉传感器能更好地识别接触状态和环境几何，机器人通过迁移学习获得新工具使用技能。

Abstract: Tools extend the manipulation abilities of robots, much like they do for
humans. Despite human expertise in tool manipulation, teaching robots these
skills faces challenges. The complexity arises from the interplay of two
simultaneous points of contact: one between the robot and the tool, and another
between the tool and the environment. Tactile and proximity sensors play a
crucial role in identifying these complex contacts. However, learning tool
manipulation using these sensors remains challenging due to limited real-world
data and the large sim-to-real gap. To address this, we propose a few-shot
tool-use skill transfer framework using multimodal sensing. The framework
involves pre-training the base policy to capture contact states common in
tool-use skills in simulation and fine-tuning it with human demonstrations
collected in the real-world target domain to bridge the domain gap. We validate
that this framework enables teaching surface-following tasks using tools with
diverse physical and geometric properties with a small number of demonstrations
on the Franka Emika robot arm. Our analysis suggests that the robot acquires
new tool-use skills by transferring the ability to recognise tool-environment
contact relationships from pre-trained to fine-tuned policies. Additionally,
combining proximity and tactile sensors enhances the identification of contact
states and environmental geometry.

Abstract: This work presents a novel co-design strategy that integrates trajectory
planning and control to handle STL-based tasks in autonomous robots. The method
consists of two phases: $(i)$ learning spatio-temporal motion primitives to
encapsulate the inherent robot-specific constraints and $(ii)$ constructing an
STL-compliant motion plan from these primitives. Initially, we employ
reinforcement learning to construct a library of control policies that perform
trajectories described by the motion primitives. Then, we map motion primitives
to spatio-temporal characteristics. Subsequently, we present a sampling-based
STL-compliant motion planning strategy tailored to meet the STL specification.
The proposed model-free approach, which generates feasible STL-compliant motion
plans across various environments, is validated on differential-drive and
quadruped robots across various STL specifications. Demonstration videos are

Abstract: Robots are increasingly integrated across industries, particularly in
healthcare. However, many valuable applications for quadrupedal robots remain
overlooked. This research explores the effectiveness of three reinforcement
learning algorithms in training a simulated quadruped robot for autonomous
navigation and obstacle avoidance. The goal is to develop a robotic guide dog
simulation capable of path following and obstacle avoidance, with long-term
potential for real-world assistance to guide dogs and visually impaired
individuals. It also seeks to expand research into medical 'pets', including
robotic guide and alert dogs.
  A comparative analysis of thirteen related research papers shaped key
evaluation criteria, including collision detection, pathfinding algorithms,
sensor usage, robot type, and simulation platforms. The study focuses on sensor
inputs, collision frequency, reward signals, and learning progression to
determine which algorithm best supports robotic navigation in complex
environments.
  Custom-made environments were used to ensure fair evaluation of all three
algorithms under controlled conditions, allowing consistent data collection.
Results show that Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) outperformed Deep
Q-Network (DQN) and Q-learning across all metrics, particularly in average and
median steps to goal per episode.
  By analysing these results, this study contributes to robotic navigation, AI
and medical robotics, offering insights into the feasibility of AI-driven
quadruped mobility and its role in assistive robotics.

Abstract: Learning visuomotor policies via imitation has proven effective across a wide
range of robotic domains. However, the performance of these policies is heavily
dependent on the number of training demonstrations, which requires expensive
data collection in the real world. In this work, we aim to reduce data
collection efforts when learning visuomotor robot policies by leveraging
existing or cost-effective data from a wide range of embodiments, such as
public robot datasets and the datasets of humans playing with objects (human
data from play). Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we use optic
flow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model
(WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of
robot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent
Policy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by
searching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real
world experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of
policies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement
with 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50
demonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand
episodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different
robots or a cost-effective human dataset from play.
