### [1] [HOLODECK 2.0: Vision-Language-Guided 3D World Generation with Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05899)
*Zixuan Bian,Ruohan Ren,Yue Yang,Chris Callison-Burch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOLODECK 2.0是一个基于视觉语言模型的3D场景生成框架，支持交互式编辑和多样化风格，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D场景生成依赖人工且自动化方法难以支持开放域和灵活编辑，因此需要一种直接从文本生成高质量3D场景的解决方案。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型解析场景需求，结合先进3D生成模型生成资产，并通过空间约束实现语义和物理合理的布局。

Result: HOLODECK 2.0生成多样化、高语义保真度的3D场景，在人类评估和CLIP测试中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HOLODECK 2.0为3D场景生成提供了高效、灵活的解决方案，并展示了在游戏建模中的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D scene generation plays a crucial role in gaming, artistic creation,
virtual reality and many other domains. However, current 3D scene design still
relies heavily on extensive manual effort from creators, and existing automated
methods struggle to generate open-domain scenes or support flexible editing. As
a result, generating 3D worlds directly from text has garnered increasing
attention. In this paper, we introduce HOLODECK 2.0, an advanced
vision-language-guided framework for 3D world generation with support for
interactive scene editing based on human feedback. HOLODECK 2.0 can generate
diverse and stylistically rich 3D scenes (e.g., realistic, cartoon, anime, and
cyberpunk styles) that exhibit high semantic fidelity to fine-grained input
descriptions, suitable for both indoor and open-domain environments. HOLODECK
2.0 leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to identify and parse the objects
required in a scene and generates corresponding high-quality assets via
state-of-the-art 3D generative models. It then iteratively applies spatial
constraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and
physically plausible layouts. Human evaluations and CLIP-based assessments
demonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely
aligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming
baselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios. Additionally, we provide
editing capabilities that flexibly adapt to human feedback, supporting layout
refinement and style-consistent object edits. Finally, we present a practical
application of HOLODECK 2.0 in procedural game modeling, generating visually
rich and immersive environments, potentially boosting efficiency.

### [2] [LV-Net: Anatomy-aware lateral ventricle shape modeling with a case study on Alzheimer's disease, the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle flagship study of ageing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06055)
*Wonjung Park,Suhyun Ahn,Jinah Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LV-Net是一种新框架，通过变形联合LV-海马模板网格，从脑MRI生成个性化3D LV网格，提高了重建精度和形状统计准确性，并应用于阿尔茨海默病分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 侧脑室（LV）形状分析作为神经系统疾病的生物标志物具有潜力，但个体间形状差异大和MRI分辨率限制导致分割困难。

Method: LV-Net通过变形联合LV-海马模板网格生成3D LV网格，利用解剖关系减少分割伪影，并通过顶点分类增强点对应性。

Result: LV-Net在分割不完美时仍实现高重建精度，提供更可靠的形状描述符，并识别出与阿尔茨海默病显著相关的LV子区域。

Conclusion: LV-Net在LV形状分析中表现出色，为疾病研究提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: Lateral ventricle (LV) shape analysis holds promise as a biomarker for
neurological diseases; however, challenges remain due to substantial shape
variability across individuals and segmentation difficulties arising from
limited MRI resolution. We introduce LV-Net, a novel framework for producing
individualized 3D LV meshes from brain MRI by deforming an anatomy-aware joint
LV-hippocampus template mesh. By incorporating anatomical relationships
embedded within the joint template, LV-Net reduces boundary segmentation
artifacts and improves reconstruction robustness. In addition, by classifying
the vertices of the template mesh based on their anatomical adjacency, our
method enhances point correspondence across subjects, leading to more accurate
LV shape statistics. We demonstrate that LV-Net achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy, even in the presence of segmentation imperfections,
and delivers more reliable shape descriptors across diverse datasets. Finally,
we apply LV-Net to Alzheimer's disease analysis, identifying LV subregions that
show significantly associations with the disease relative to cognitively normal
controls. The codes for LV shape modeling are available at
https://github.com/PWonjung/LV_Shape_Modeling.

### [3] [Boosting Adversarial Transferability via Residual Perturbation Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05689)
*Jinjia Peng,Zeze Tao,Huibing Wang,Meng Wang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ResPA的新型攻击方法，通过利用残差梯度作为扰动方向，提高对抗样本的迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迁移攻击方法忽略了扰动方向的影响，导致迁移性受限。

Method: ResPA通过指数移动平均获取参考梯度，并利用当前梯度与参考梯度的残差来捕捉全局扰动方向的变化。

Result: 实验表明，ResPA的迁移性优于现有典型迁移攻击方法，且与输入变换方法结合可进一步提升效果。

Conclusion: ResPA通过优化扰动方向，显著提高了对抗样本的迁移性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples while suffering
from incorrect predictions via imperceptible perturbations. Transfer-based
attacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these
examples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that
adversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability
to alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook
the influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.
In this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation
Attack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction
to guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.
Specifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input
gradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which
encompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying
on the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation
direction, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient
and the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation
direction. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of
ResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the
transferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current
input transformation methods. The code is available at
https://github.com/ZezeTao/ResPA.

### [4] [Generalized Few-Shot Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05732)
*Pinxuan Li,Bing Cao,Changqing Zhang,Qinghua Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种广义少样本OOD检测框架（GOOD），通过引入通用知识模型（GKM）提升模型的泛化能力，解决了现有方法因少样本学习导致的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本OOD检测方法因训练数据有限，导致泛化能力不足，在不同场景下表现不一致。

Method: 提出GOOD框架，利用GKM增强模型的通用知识，并通过知识动态嵌入（KDE）机制动态调整通用知识的引导。

Result: 实验证明GOOD在真实OOD基准测试中表现优越。

Conclusion: GOOD框架通过GS平衡和KDE机制显著提升了少样本OOD检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Few-shot Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection has emerged as a critical
research direction in machine learning for practical deployment. Most existing
Few-shot OOD detection methods suffer from insufficient generalization
capability for the open world. Due to the few-shot learning paradigm, the OOD
detection ability is often overfit to the limited training data itself, thus
degrading the performance on generalized data and performing inconsistently
across different scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed a
Generalized Few-shot OOD Detection (GOOD) framework, which empowers the general
knowledge of the OOD detection model with an auxiliary General Knowledge Model
(GKM), instead of directly learning from few-shot data. We proceed to reveal
the few-shot OOD detection from a generalization perspective and theoretically
derive the Generality-Specificity balance (GS-balance) for OOD detection, which
provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error with a general
knowledge model. Accordingly, we propose a Knowledge Dynamic Embedding (KDE)
mechanism to adaptively modulate the guidance of general knowledge. KDE
dynamically aligns the output distributions of the OOD detection model to the
general knowledge model based on the Generalized Belief (G-Belief) of GKM,
thereby boosting the GS-balance. Experiments on real-world OOD benchmarks
demonstrate our superiority. Codes will be available.

### [5] [UnGuide: Learning to Forget with LoRA-Guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05755)
*Agnieszka Polowczyk,Alicja Polowczyk,Dawid Malarz,Artur Kasymov,Marcin Mazur,Jacek Tabor,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UnGuide是一种新方法，通过动态推理机制UnGuidance，结合LoRA适配器，实现对扩散模型中特定知识的精确去除，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模文本到图像扩散模型可能被滥用生成有害或误导性内容，亟需有效的机器遗忘方法。

Method: UnGuide结合LoRA适配器和动态UnGuidance机制，通过调整引导尺度选择性去除知识。

Result: UnGuide在概念去除任务中表现优于现有LoRA方法，同时保持图像保真度。

Conclusion: UnGuide为扩散模型的知识去除提供了高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have heightened
concerns about their potential misuse, especially in generating harmful or
misleading content. This underscores the urgent need for effective machine
unlearning, i.e., removing specific knowledge or concepts from pretrained
models without compromising overall performance. One possible approach is
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which offers an efficient means to fine-tune models
for targeted unlearning. However, LoRA often inadvertently alters unrelated
content, leading to diminished image fidelity and realism. To address this
limitation, we introduce UnGuide -- a novel approach which incorporates
UnGuidance, a dynamic inference mechanism that leverages Classifier-Free
Guidance (CFG) to exert precise control over the unlearning process. UnGuide
modulates the guidance scale based on the stability of a few first steps of
denoising processes, enabling selective unlearning by LoRA adapter. For prompts
containing the erased concept, the LoRA module predominates and is
counterbalanced by the base model; for unrelated prompts, the base model
governs generation, preserving content fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate
that UnGuide achieves controlled concept removal and retains the expressive
power of diffusion models, outperforming existing LoRA-based methods in both
object erasure and explicit content removal tasks.

### [6] [Improving Masked Style Transfer using Blended Partial Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05769)
*Seyed Hadi Seyed,Ayberk Cansever,David Hart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于部分卷积的风格迁移网络，专注于对图像特定区域进行风格迁移，避免了传统方法中风格特征捕捉不准确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通常对整个图像进行风格迁移，而用户可能仅需对特定区域应用风格，直接掩码处理会导致风格特征捕捉不准确。

Method: 采用部分卷积网络，结合网络内部混合技术，精确地对感兴趣区域进行风格迁移，并处理区域选择的不完美性。

Result: 在SA-1B数据集上验证，视觉和定量评估均显示改进。

Conclusion: 该方法在特定区域风格迁移中表现更优，代码已开源。

Abstract: Artistic style transfer has long been possible with the advancements of
convolution- and transformer-based neural networks. Most algorithms apply the
artistic style transfer to the whole image, but individual users may only need
to apply a style transfer to a specific region in the image. The standard
practice is to simply mask the image after the stylization. This work shows
that this approach tends to improperly capture the style features in the region
of interest. We propose a partial-convolution-based style transfer network that
accurately applies the style features exclusively to the region of interest.
Additionally, we present network-internal blending techniques that account for
imperfections in the region selection. We show that this visually and
quantitatively improves stylization using examples from the SA-1B dataset. Code
is publicly available at https://github.com/davidmhart/StyleTransferMasked.

### [7] [MAISI-v2: Accelerated 3D High-Resolution Medical Image Synthesis with Rectified Flow and Region-specific Contrastive Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05772)
*Can Zhao,Pengfei Guo,Dong Yang,Yucheng Tang,Yufan He,Benjamin Simon,Mason Belue,Stephanie Harmon,Baris Turkbey,Daguang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAISI-v2是一种加速的3D医学图像合成框架，通过整合rectified flow实现快速高质量生成，解决了现有方法的通用性、推理速度和条件一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像合成方法在通用性、推理速度和条件一致性方面存在不足，MAISI-v2旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MAISI-v2整合了rectified flow以加速生成，并引入区域特异性对比损失增强条件一致性。

Result: 实验表明，MAISI-v2实现了33倍加速的潜在扩散模型，并达到SOTA图像质量，合成图像可用于数据增强。

Conclusion: MAISI-v2在医学图像合成中表现出色，代码和模型已开源以促进社区发展。

Abstract: Medical image synthesis is an important topic for both clinical and research
applications. Recently, diffusion models have become a leading approach in this
area. Despite their strengths, many existing methods struggle with (1) limited
generalizability that only work for specific body regions or voxel spacings,
(2) slow inference, which is a common issue for diffusion models, and (3) weak
alignment with input conditions, which is a critical issue for medical imaging.
MAISI, a previously proposed framework, addresses generalizability issues but
still suffers from slow inference and limited condition consistency. In this
work, we present MAISI-v2, the first accelerated 3D medical image synthesis
framework that integrates rectified flow to enable fast and high quality
generation. To further enhance condition fidelity, we introduce a novel
region-specific contrastive loss to enhance the sensitivity to region of
interest. Our experiments show that MAISI-v2 can achieve SOTA image quality
with $33 \times$ acceleration for latent diffusion model. We also conducted a
downstream segmentation experiment to show that the synthetic images can be
used for data augmentation. We release our code, training details, model
weights, and a GUI demo to facilitate reproducibility and promote further
development within the community.

### [8] [Few-Shot Deployment of Pretrained MRI Transformers in Brain Imaging Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05783)
*Mengyu Li,Guoyao Shen,Chad W. Farris,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练MRI变换器的少样本部署框架，结合MAE预训练策略和轻量级线性头或混合架构，在数据有限条件下实现高效、稳定的医学影像任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中标注数据稀缺导致变换器模型实际应用受限的问题。

Method: 使用MAE预训练策略在大规模多队列脑MRI数据集上获取可迁移的潜在表示，结合轻量级线性头或混合架构MAE-FUnet进行分类和分割任务。

Result: 在MRI序列识别中达到SOTA精度，在分割任务中优于其他基线模型。

Conclusion: 该框架高效、稳定且可扩展，适用于低资源临床环境和神经影像应用。

Abstract: Machine learning using transformers has shown great potential in medical
imaging, but its real-world applicability remains limited due to the scarcity
of annotated data. In this study, we propose a practical framework for the
few-shot deployment of pretrained MRI transformers in diverse brain imaging
tasks. By utilizing the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on a
large-scale, multi-cohort brain MRI dataset comprising over 31 million slices,
we obtain highly transferable latent representations that generalize well
across tasks and datasets. For high-level tasks such as classification, a
frozen MAE encoder combined with a lightweight linear head achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy in MRI sequence identification with minimal
supervision. For low-level tasks such as segmentation, we propose MAE-FUnet, a
hybrid architecture that fuses multiscale CNN features with pretrained MAE
embeddings. This model consistently outperforms other strong baselines in both
skull stripping and multi-class anatomical segmentation under data-limited
conditions. With extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our
framework demonstrates efficiency, stability, and scalability, suggesting its
suitability for low-resource clinical environments and broader neuroimaging
applications.

### [9] [Optimization-Free Style Transfer for 3D Gaussian Splats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05813)
*Raphael Du Sablon,David Hart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需重建或优化的3D高斯样条风格迁移方法，通过生成图结构实现快速风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要重建或优化样条，计算成本高，限制了实用性。

Method: 在样条隐式表面生成图结构，使用前馈表面风格化方法并插值回样条。

Result: 支持任意风格图像和样条，无需额外训练，速度在2分钟内完成。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且质量高，适用于消费级硬件。

Abstract: The task of style transfer for 3D Gaussian splats has been explored in many
previous works, but these require reconstructing or fine-tuning the splat while
incorporating style information or optimizing a feature extraction network on
the splat representation. We propose a reconstruction- and optimization-free
approach to stylizing 3D Gaussian splats. This is done by generating a graph
structure across the implicit surface of the splat representation. A
feed-forward, surface-based stylization method is then used and interpolated
back to the individual splats in the scene. This allows for any style image and
3D Gaussian splat to be used without any additional training or optimization.
This also allows for fast stylization of splats, achieving speeds under 2
minutes even on consumer-grade hardware. We demonstrate the quality results
this approach achieves and compare to other 3D Gaussian splat style transfer
methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/davidmhart/FastSplatStyler.

### [10] [MZEN: Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF for 3-D Reconstruction with Unknown Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05819)
*Jong-Ik Park,Carlee Joe-Wong,Gary K. Fedder*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MZEN是一种改进的NeRF框架，通过处理多缩放图像集，显著提升了工业检测中的细节重建能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF方法在工业检测中无法捕捉微米级细节，且多缩放图像会破坏多视角一致性。MZEN旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MZEN引入可学习的缩放标量，并采用新的姿态策略：先解决广角图像建立全局框架，再通过缩放一致的裁剪匹配处理缩放图像。

Result: 在多个场景中，MZEN显著优于基线方法，PSNR提升28%，SSIM提升10%，LPIPS降低222%。

Conclusion: MZEN成功将NeRF扩展到工业检测领域，兼顾全局精度与微米级细节。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods excel at 3D reconstruction from
multiple 2D images, even those taken with unknown camera poses. However, they
still miss the fine-detailed structures that matter in industrial inspection,
e.g., detecting sub-micron defects on a production line or analyzing chips with
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). In these scenarios, the sensor resolution
is fixed and compute budgets are tight, so the only way to expose fine
structure is to add zoom-in images; yet, this breaks the multi-view consistency
that pose-free NeRF training relies on. We propose Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF
(MZEN), the first NeRF framework that natively handles multi-zoom image sets.
MZEN (i) augments the pin-hole camera model with an explicit, learnable zoom
scalar that scales the focal length, and (ii) introduces a novel pose strategy:
wide-field images are solved first to establish a global metric frame, and
zoom-in images are then pose-primed to the nearest wide-field counterpart via a
zoom-consistent crop-and-match procedure before joint refinement. Across eight
forward-facing scenes$\unicode{x2013}$synthetic TCAD models, real SEM of
micro-structures, and BLEFF objects$\unicode{x2013}$MZEN consistently
outperforms pose-free baselines and even high-resolution variants, boosting
PSNR by up to $28 \%$, SSIM by $10 \%$, and reducing LPIPS by up to $222 \%$.
MZEN, therefore, extends NeRF to real-world factory settings, preserving global
accuracy while capturing the micron-level details essential for industrial
inspection.

### [11] [TSMS-SAM2: Multi-scale Temporal Sampling Augmentation and Memory-Splitting Pruning for Promptable Video Object Segmentation and Tracking in Surgical Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05829)
*Guoping Xu,Hua-Chieh Shao,You Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TSMS-SAM2提出了一种新框架，通过多时间尺度视频采样增强和内存分割修剪机制，提升了手术视频中可提示视频对象分割与跟踪的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型（如SAM2）在手术视频分析中面临复杂运动动态和内存冗余的挑战，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用多时间尺度视频采样增强和内存分割修剪机制，优化对象分割与跟踪。

Result: 在EndoVis2017和EndoVis2018数据集上分别取得95.24和86.73的最高平均Dice分数，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TSMS-SAM2在复杂手术场景中表现出高效、稳健的分割潜力，多尺度时间增强和内存分割策略有效。

Abstract: Promptable video object segmentation and tracking (VOST) has seen significant
advances with the emergence of foundation models like Segment Anything Model 2
(SAM2); however, their application in surgical video analysis remains
challenging due to complex motion dynamics and the redundancy of memory that
impedes effective learning. In this work, we propose TSMS-SAM2, a novel
framework that enhances promptable VOST in surgical videos by addressing
challenges of rapid object motion and memory redundancy in SAM2. TSMS-SAM2
introduces two key strategies: multi-temporal-scale video sampling augmentation
to improve robustness against motion variability, and a memory splitting and
pruning mechanism that organizes and filters past frame features for more
efficient and accurate segmentation. Evaluated on EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018
datasets, TSMS-SAM2 achieved the highest mean Dice scores of 95.24 and 86.73,
respectively, outperforming prior SAM-based and task-specific methods.
Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of multiscale temporal
augmentation and memory splitting, highlighting the framework's potential for
robust, efficient segmentation in complex surgical scenarios. Our source code
will be available at https://github.com/apple1986/TSMS-SAM2.

### [12] [Temporal Cluster Assignment for Efficient Real-Time Video Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05851)
*Ka-Wai Yung,Felix J. S. Bragman,Jialang Xu,Imanol Luengo,Danail Stoyanov,Evangelos B. Mazomenos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Temporal Cluster Assignment (TCA)的轻量级策略，通过利用帧间时间一致性优化视频分割中的token聚类，显著减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Swin Transformer在视频分割中表现出色，但其高计算成本限制了实时应用。现有token减少方法无法有效利用时间冗余。

Method: TCA通过时间相关性优化token聚类，避免冗余token的盲目丢弃，保留细节同时减少计算。

Result: 在多个数据集（YouTube-VIS 2019/2021, OVIS, 手术视频）上验证，TCA显著提升了准确性与速度的平衡。

Conclusion: TCA是一种无需微调的策略，适用于自然和特定领域视频，有效优化视频分割性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have substantially advanced the capabilities of
segmentation models across both image and video domains. Among them, the Swin
Transformer stands out for its ability to capture hierarchical, multi-scale
representations, making it a popular backbone for segmentation in videos.
However, despite its window-attention scheme, it still incurs a high
computational cost, especially in larger variants commonly used for dense
prediction in videos. This remains a major bottleneck for real-time,
resource-constrained applications. Whilst token reduction methods have been
proposed to alleviate this, the window-based attention mechanism of Swin
requires a fixed number of tokens per window, limiting the applicability of
conventional pruning techniques. Meanwhile, training-free token clustering
approaches have shown promise in image segmentation while maintaining window
consistency. Nevertheless, they fail to exploit temporal redundancy, missing a
key opportunity to further optimize video segmentation performance. We
introduce Temporal Cluster Assignment (TCA), a lightweight and effective,
fine-tuning-free strategy that enhances token clustering by leveraging temporal
coherence across frames. Instead of indiscriminately dropping redundant tokens,
TCA refines token clusters using temporal correlations, thereby retaining
fine-grained details while significantly reducing computation. Extensive
evaluations on YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, OVIS, and a private surgical
video dataset show that TCA consistently boosts the accuracy-speed trade-off of
existing clustering-based methods. Our results demonstrate that TCA generalizes
competently across both natural and domain-specific videos.

*Kaiser Hamid,Khandakar Ashrafi Akbar,Nade Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于视觉-语言框架的方法，通过自然语言预测驾驶员的视觉注意力变化，利用少样本和零样本学习在静态RGB图像上实现，并在BDD-A数据集上进行了优化和评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注单时刻的注意力分配，而本文旨在通过自然语言建模驾驶员动态变化的视觉注意力，为自动驾驶和HCI提供更可解释的解决方案。

Method: 通过人类反馈优化BDD-A数据集的高质量标注，微调LLaVA模型，结合低层线索和上下文（如路线语义、风险预测），实现基于语言的注意力行为描述。

Result: 微调后的模型在注意力转移检测和可解释性上优于通用视觉-语言模型，并在少样本和单样本训练中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法首次通过自然语言生成驾驶员视觉注意力预测，为自动驾驶中的可解释AI提供了新方向，并为下游任务（如行为预测和人机协作）奠定了基础。

Abstract: Driver visual attention prediction is a critical task in autonomous driving
and human-computer interaction (HCI) research. Most prior studies focus on
estimating attention allocation at a single moment in time, typically using
static RGB images such as driving scene pictures. In this work, we propose a
vision-language framework that models the changing landscape of drivers' gaze
through natural language, using few-shot and zero-shot learning on single RGB
images. We curate and refine high-quality captions from the BDD-A dataset using
human-in-the-loop feedback, then fine-tune LLaVA to align visual perception
with attention-centric scene understanding. Our approach integrates both
low-level cues and top-down context (e.g., route semantics, risk anticipation),
enabling language-based descriptions of gaze behavior. We evaluate performance
across training regimes (few shot, and one-shot) and introduce domain-specific
metrics for semantic alignment and response diversity. Results show that our
fine-tuned model outperforms general-purpose VLMs in attention shift detection
and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is among the first attempts to
generate driver visual attention allocation and shifting predictions in natural
language, offering a new direction for explainable AI in autonomous driving.
Our approach provides a foundation for downstream tasks such as behavior
forecasting, human-AI teaming, and multi-agent coordination.

### [14] [Multi-view Gaze Target Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05857)
*Qiaomu Miao,Vivek Raju Golani,Jingyi Xu,Progga Paromita Dutta,Minh Hoai,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多视角相机方法用于视线目标估计（GTE），通过整合不同视角信息提高准确性，解决单视角方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单视角GTE方法面临人脸遮挡、目标模糊和视野外目标等问题，多视角方法能显著提升性能。

Method: 采用双视角输入，结合头部信息聚合（HIA）、基于不确定性的视线选择（UGS）和基于极线的场景注意力（ESA）模块。

Result: 方法显著优于单视角基线，尤其在第二视角提供清晰人脸视图时；还能仅用第二视角图像估计第一视角的视线目标。

Conclusion: 多视角GTE方法有效解决了单视角的局限性，并引入了一个多视角数据集供未来研究使用。

Abstract: This paper presents a method that utilizes multiple camera views for the gaze
target estimation (GTE) task. The approach integrates information from
different camera views to improve accuracy and expand applicability, addressing
limitations in existing single-view methods that face challenges such as face
occlusion, target ambiguity, and out-of-view targets. Our method processes a
pair of camera views as input, incorporating a Head Information Aggregation
(HIA) module for leveraging head information from both views for more accurate
gaze estimation, an Uncertainty-based Gaze Selection (UGS) for identifying the
most reliable gaze output, and an Epipolar-based Scene Attention (ESA) module
for cross-view background information sharing. This approach significantly
outperforms single-view baselines, especially when the second camera provides a
clear view of the person's face. Additionally, our method can estimate the gaze
target in the first view using the image of the person in the second view only,
a capability not possessed by single-view GTE methods. Furthermore, the paper
introduces a multi-view dataset for developing and evaluating multi-view GTE
methods. Data and code are available at

Conclusion: ETTA为测试时适应提供了高效且有效的解决方案，成为新的性能标杆。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP show strong zero-shot
performance but struggle with generalization under distribution shifts.
Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting VLMs to unlabeled test
data in new domains. While some TTA methods rely on prompt-tuning,
training-free cache-based approaches are preferred for efficiency. However,
current cache-based TTA models store only a limited set of high-confidence
samples, restricting the decision boundary to these samples and ignoring the
influence of other incoming test data. To address this, we propose Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), introducing a Recursive Updating module that
integrates all incoming test samples, progressively refining the decision
boundary. This strategy mimics an unbounded cache, dynamically updating
contextual embeddings for improved accuracy with minimal memory and
computational overhead. ETTA also includes an Adaptive Ensemble module to
reduce prompt dependency in image-to-text scores by dynamically selecting
optimal prompts for each class. Furthermore, ETTA adaptively combines scores
from both modules based on confidence levels, leveraging their complementary
strengths. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks confirm that ETTA surpasses
the state-of-the-art TTA models in computational complexity and accuracy,
setting a new standard for effective, efficient test-time adaptation. The code
has been released at https://github.com/hamidreza-dastmalchi/ETTA.

Conclusion: RopStitch通过创新的架构和优化策略，有效提升了图像拼接的性能，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: We present \textit{RopStitch}, an unsupervised deep image stitching framework
with both robustness and naturalness. To ensure the robustness of
\textit{RopStitch}, we propose to incorporate the universal prior of content
perception into the image stitching model by a dual-branch architecture. It
separately captures coarse and fine features and integrates them to achieve
highly generalizable performance across diverse unseen real-world scenes.
Concretely, the dual-branch model consists of a pretrained branch to capture
semantically invariant representations and a learnable branch to extract
fine-grained discriminative features, which are then merged into a whole by a
controllable factor at the correlation level. Besides, considering that content
alignment and structural preservation are often contradictory to each other, we
propose a concept of virtual optimal planes to relieve this conflict. To this
end, we model this problem as a process of estimating homography decomposition
coefficients, and design an iterative coefficient predictor and minimal
semantic distortion constraint to identify the optimal plane. This scheme is
finally incorporated into \textit{RopStitch} by warping both views onto the
optimal plane bidirectionally. Extensive experiments across various datasets
demonstrate that \textit{RopStitch} significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scene robustness and content naturalness. The code is available
at {\color{red}https://github.com/MmelodYy/RopStitch}.

Abstract: Over the past two decades, mobile imaging has experienced a profound
transformation, with cell phones rapidly eclipsing all other forms of digital
photography in popularity. Today's cell phones are equipped with a diverse
range of imaging technologies - laser depth ranging, multi-focal camera arrays,
and split-pixel sensors - alongside non-visual sensors such as gyroscopes,
accelerometers, and magnetometers. This, combined with on-board integrated
chips for image and signal processing, makes the cell phone a versatile
pocket-sized computational imaging platform. Parallel to this, we have seen in
recent years how neural fields - small neural networks trained to map
continuous spatial input coordinates to output signals - enable the
reconstruction of complex scenes without explicit data representations such as
pixel arrays or point clouds. In this thesis, I demonstrate how carefully
designed neural field models can compactly represent complex geometry and
lighting effects. Enabling applications such as depth estimation, layer
separation, and image stitching directly from collected in-the-wild mobile
photography data. These methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches without
relying on complex pre-processing steps, labeled ground truth data, or machine
learning priors. Instead, they leverage well-constructed, self-regularized
models that tackle challenging inverse problems through stochastic gradient
descent, fitting directly to raw measurements from a smartphone.

Abstract: Monitoring construction progress is crucial yet resource-intensive, prompting
the exploration of computer-vision-based methodologies for enhanced efficiency
and scalability. Traditional data acquisition methods, primarily focusing on
indoor environments, falter in construction site's complex, cluttered, and
dynamically changing conditions. This paper critically evaluates the
application of two advanced 3D segmentation methods, Segment Anything Model
(SAM) and Mask3D, in challenging outdoor and indoor conditions. Trained
initially on indoor datasets, both models' adaptability and performance are
assessed in real-world construction settings, highlighting the gap in current
segmentation approaches due to the absence of benchmarks for outdoor scenarios.
Through a comparative analysis, this study not only showcases the relative
effectiveness of SAM and Mask3D but also addresses the critical need for
tailored segmentation workflows capable of extracting actionable insights from
construction site data, thereby advancing the field towards more automated and
precise monitoring techniques.

Conclusion: SINGAD通过自监督优化解决了多视角几何不一致性和数据依赖性问题，显著提升了法线估计性能。

Abstract: The lack of spatial dimensional information remains a challenge in normal
estimation from a single image. Recent diffusion-based methods have
demonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on
data-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface
interaction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the
discrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity
in differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric
errors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby
forcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper
proposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for
Normal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating
physics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based
reprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into
normal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric
inconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a
light-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale
geometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring
multi-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed
within a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain
normal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation.
Furthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for
self-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the
reconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal
datasets. Quantitative evaluations on the Google Scanned Objects dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across
multiple metrics.

Motivation: 现有方法在训练成本高且可能损害LLMs推理能力的情况下，难以将高保真视觉合成能力整合到LLMs中。

Method: 使用patch-level CLIP图像嵌入作为潜在变量，轻量级调整ControlNet，并初始化视觉生成分支以保留MLLMs的多模态推理能力。

Result: Bifrost-1在视觉保真度和多模态理解上表现优异，且训练计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: Bifrost-1通过高效整合预训练模型，实现了高性能的可控图像生成。

Abstract: There is growing interest in integrating high-fidelity visual synthesis
capabilities into large language models (LLMs) without compromising their
strong reasoning capabilities. Existing methods that directly train LLMs or
bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the
backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We
present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent
variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder.
These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with
a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation
branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the
patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and
diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables
high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training
efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or
better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and
multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We
also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our
design choices.

Method: PASG框架包括自动几何基元提取、VLM驱动的语义锚定，以及空间语义推理基准和微调VLM（Qwen2.5VL-PA）。

Result: PASG在多样化机器人操作任务中表现优异，性能接近人工标注，实现了更细粒度的语义-功能理解。

Conclusion: PASG为机器人操作中几何基元与任务语义的统一提供了新范式。

Abstract: The fragmentation between high-level task semantics and low-level geometric
features remains a persistent challenge in robotic manipulation. While
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating affordance-aware
visual representations, the lack of semantic grounding in canonical spaces and
reliance on manual annotations severely limit their ability to capture dynamic
semantic-affordance relationships. To address these, we propose Primitive-Aware
Semantic Grounding (PASG), a closed-loop framework that introduces: (1)
Automatic primitive extraction through geometric feature aggregation, enabling
cross-category detection of keypoints and axes; (2) VLM-driven semantic
anchoring that dynamically couples geometric primitives with functional
affordances and task-relevant description; (3) A spatial-semantic reasoning
benchmark and a fine-tuned VLM (Qwen2.5VL-PA). We demonstrate PASG's
effectiveness in practical robotic manipulation tasks across diverse scenarios,
achieving performance comparable to manual annotations. PASG achieves a
finer-grained semantic-affordance understanding of objects, establishing a
unified paradigm for bridging geometric primitives with task semantics in
robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: AnimateScene通过统一框架解决了3D场景与4D人体动画的集成问题，实现了高质量的视觉效果。

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and 4D human animation have seen rapid progress and
broad adoption in recent years. However, seamlessly integrating reconstructed
scenes with 4D human animation to produce visually engaging results remains
challenging. One key difficulty lies in placing the human at the correct
location and scale within the scene while avoiding unrealistic
interpenetration. Another challenge is that the human and the background may
exhibit different lighting and style, leading to unrealistic composites. In
addition, appealing character motion videos are often accompanied by camera
movements, which means that the viewpoints need to be reconstructed along a
specified trajectory. We present AnimateScene, which addresses the above issues
in a unified framework. First, we design an accurate placement module that
automatically determines a plausible 3D position for the human and prevents any
interpenetration within the scene during motion. Second, we propose a
training-free style alignment method that adapts the 4D human representation to
match the background's lighting and style, achieving coherent visual
integration. Finally, we design a joint post-reconstruction method for both the
4D human and the 3D scene that allows camera trajectories to be inserted,
enabling the final rendered video to feature visually appealing camera
movements. Extensive experiments show that AnimateScene generates dynamic scene
videos with high geometric detail and spatiotemporal coherence across various
camera and action combinations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的深度补全模型在新环境（目标数据）中因协变量偏移导致预测错误，而目标数据在部署前无法获取，因此需要一种无需假设目标分布的方法。

Method: 利用对抗扰动探索数据空间，训练能量模型评分深度预测的局部区域是否为源数据分布，测试时通过最小化能量更新模型参数。

Result: 在三个室内和三个室外数据集上，ETA平均分别提升了10.23%和6.94%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ETA通过能量模型和测试时适应，有效解决了深度补全模型在新环境中的性能下降问题。

Abstract: We propose a method for test-time adaptation of pretrained depth completion
models. Depth completion models, trained on some ``source'' data, often predict
erroneous outputs when transferred to ``target'' data captured in novel
environmental conditions due to a covariate shift. The crux of our method lies
in quantifying the likelihood of depth predictions belonging to the source data
distribution. The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution
(target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions
regarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a
mechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model
that scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution.
We update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to
minimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the
source distribution. We call our method ``Energy-based Test-time Adaptation'',
or ETA for short. We evaluate our method across three indoor and three outdoor
datasets, where ETA improve over the previous state-of-the-art method by an
average of 6.94% for outdoors and 10.23% for indoors. Project Page:

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和准确性之间取得了良好平衡，适用于高效视频计算机视觉系统。

Abstract: The efficiency of video computer vision system remains a challenging task due
to the high temporal redundancy inside a video. Existing works have been
proposed for efficient vision computer vision. However, they do not fully
reduce the temporal redundancy and neglect the front end computation overhead.
In this paper, we propose an efficient video computer vision system. First,
image signal processor is removed and Bayer-format data is directly fed into
video computer vision models, thus saving the front end computation. Second,
instead of optical flow models and video codecs, a fast block matching-based
motion estimation algorithm is proposed specifically for efficient video
computer vision, with a MV refinement module. To correct the error,
context-aware block refinement network is introduced to refine regions with
large error. To further balance the accuracy and efficiency, a frame selection
strategy is employed. Experiments on multiple video computer vision tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves significant acceleration with slight
performance loss.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在多模态情感识别中表现优异，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Emotion recognition plays a vital role in enhancing human-computer
interaction. In this study, we tackle the MER-SEMI challenge of the MER2025
competition by proposing a novel multimodal emotion recognition framework. To
address the issue of data scarcity, we leverage large-scale pre-trained models
to extract informative features from visual, audio, and textual modalities.
Specifically, for the visual modality, we design a dual-branch visual encoder
that captures both global frame-level features and localized facial
representations. For the textual modality, we introduce a context-enriched
method that employs large language models to enrich emotional cues within the
input text. To effectively integrate these multimodal features, we propose a
fusion strategy comprising two key components, i.e., self-attention mechanisms
for dynamic modality weighting, and residual connections to preserve original
representations. Beyond architectural design, we further refine noisy labels in
the training set by a multi-source labeling strategy. Our approach achieves a
substantial performance improvement over the official baseline on the
MER2025-SEMI dataset, attaining a weighted F-score of 87.49% compared to
78.63%, thereby validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Motivation: 现有方法因缺乏结构化配对数据，导致化妆细节粗糙且难以平衡身份和化妆保真度。

Method: 引入MakeupQuad数据集，提出EvoMakeup框架，通过多阶段蒸馏迭代提升数据和模型质量。

Result: EvoMakeup在真实场景中表现优异，支持高保真、可控的多任务化妆编辑。

Conclusion: 方法在化妆保真度和身份保留上取得平衡，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Facial makeup editing aims to realistically transfer makeup from a reference
to a target face. Existing methods often produce low-quality results with
coarse makeup details and struggle to preserve both identity and makeup
fidelity, mainly due to the lack of structured paired data -- where source and
result share identity, and reference and result share identical makeup. To
address this, we introduce MakeupQuad, a large-scale, high-quality dataset with
non-makeup faces, references, edited results, and textual makeup descriptions.
Building on this, we propose EvoMakeup, a unified training framework that
mitigates image degradation during multi-stage distillation, enabling iterative
improvement of both data and model quality. Although trained solely on
synthetic data, EvoMakeup generalizes well and outperforms prior methods on
real-world benchmarks. It supports high-fidelity, controllable, multi-task
makeup editing -- including full-face and partial reference-based editing, as
well as text-driven makeup editing -- within a single model. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior makeup fidelity and
identity preservation, effectively balancing both aspects. Code and dataset
will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual mathematical reasoning across various existing
benchmarks. However, these benchmarks are predominantly based on clean or
processed multimodal inputs, without incorporating the images provided by
real-world Kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) educational users. To address
this gap, we introduce MathReal, a meticulously curated dataset comprising
2,000 mathematical questions with images captured by handheld mobile devices in
authentic scenarios. Each question is an image, containing the question text
and visual element. We systematically classify the real images into three
primary categories: image quality degradation, perspective variation, and
irrelevant content interference, which are further delineated into 14
subcategories. Additionally, MathReal spans five core knowledge and ability
categories, which encompass three question types and are divided into three
difficulty levels. To comprehensively evaluate the multimodal mathematical
reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs in real-world scenarios, we
design six experimental settings that enable a systematic analysis of their
performance. Through extensive experimentation, we find that the
problem-solving abilities of existing MLLMs are significantly challenged in
realistic educational contexts. Based on this, we conduct a thorough analysis
of their performance and error patterns, providing insights into their
recognition, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities, and outlining
directions for future improvements. Data and code:

Abstract: Recent advances in novel view synthesis (NVS) have enabled real-time
rendering with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, existing methods struggle
with artifacts and missing regions when rendering from viewpoints that deviate
from the training trajectory, limiting seamless scene exploration. To address
this, we propose a 3DGS-based pipeline that generates additional training views
to enhance reconstruction. We introduce an information-gain-driven virtual
camera placement strategy to maximize scene coverage, followed by video
diffusion priors to refine rendered results. Fine-tuning 3D Gaussians with
these enhanced views significantly improves reconstruction quality. To evaluate
our method, we present Wild-Explore, a benchmark designed for challenging scene
exploration. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
3DGS-based methods, enabling high-quality, artifact-free rendering from
arbitrary viewpoints.

Abstract: Sub-visible particle analysis using flow imaging microscopy combined with
deep learning has proven effective in identifying particle types, enabling the
distinction of harmless components such as silicone oil from protein particles.
However, the scarcity of available data and severe imbalance between particle
types within datasets remain substantial hurdles when applying multi-class
classifiers to such problems, often forcing researchers to rely on less
effective methods. The aforementioned issue is particularly challenging for
particle types that appear unintentionally and in lower numbers, such as
silicone oil and air bubbles, as opposed to protein particles, where obtaining
large numbers of images through controlled settings is comparatively
straightforward. In this work, we develop a state-of-the-art diffusion model to
address data imbalance by generating high-fidelity images that can augment
training datasets, enabling the effective training of multi-class deep neural
networks. We validate this approach by demonstrating that the generated samples
closely resemble real particle images in terms of visual quality and structure.
To assess the effectiveness of using diffusion-generated images in training
datasets, we conduct large-scale experiments on a validation dataset comprising
500,000 protein particle images and demonstrate that this approach improves
classification performance with no negligible downside. Finally, to promote
open research and reproducibility, we publicly release both our diffusion
models and the trained multi-class deep neural network classifiers, along with
a straightforward interface for easy integration into future studies, at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMF-Drive提出了一种基于门控Mamba融合的端到端自动驾驶框架，通过几何增强的LiDAR表示和高效的空间感知状态空间模型，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的自动驾驶方法依赖Transformer融合，存在计算复杂度高和空间先验不足的问题，限制了高分辨率特征的使用和BEV表示的有效建模。

Method: 1. 使用几何增强的柱状LiDAR表示替代传统直方图表示；2. 提出分层门控Mamba融合（GM-Fusion）架构，用高效的状态空间模型替代Transformer。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，GMF-Drive性能显著优于DiffusionDrive，达到新的SOTA。

Conclusion: 任务特定的状态空间模型在自动驾驶中性能和效率上优于通用Transformer。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models are redefining the state-of-the-art in end-to-end
autonomous driving, yet their performance is increasingly hampered by a
reliance on transformer-based fusion. These architectures face fundamental
limitations: quadratic computational complexity restricts the use of
high-resolution features, and a lack of spatial priors prevents them from
effectively modeling the inherent structure of Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations. This paper introduces GMF-Drive (Gated Mamba Fusion for
Driving), an end-to-end framework that overcomes these challenges through two
principled innovations. First, we supersede the information-limited
histogram-based LiDAR representation with a geometrically-augmented pillar
format encoding shape descriptors and statistical features, preserving critical
3D geometric details. Second, we propose a novel hierarchical gated mamba
fusion (GM-Fusion) architecture that substitutes an expensive transformer with
a highly efficient, spatially-aware state-space model (SSM). Our core BEV-SSM
leverages directional sequencing and adaptive fusion mechanisms to capture
long-range dependencies with linear complexity, while explicitly respecting the
unique spatial properties of the driving scene. Extensive experiments on the
challenging NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that GMF-Drive achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming DiffusionDrive.
Comprehensive ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component,
demonstrating that task-specific SSMs can surpass a general-purpose transformer
in both performance and efficiency for autonomous driving.

*Kiran Chhatre,Christopher Peters,Srikrishna Karanam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spectrum提出了一种基于图像到纹理扩散模型的新方法，用于细粒度的人体解析，包括身体部位和服装分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在人体解析中使用固定掩码类别，无法区分细粒度服装类型；而开放词汇分割方法通常将整个人归为一类，忽略了服装和身体部位的多样性。

Method: Spectrum通过微调文本到图像扩散模型，生成3D人体纹理图，提取特征并进行提示引导的分割，实现细粒度解析。

Result: 实验表明，Spectrum在身体部位、服装类别和未见过的服装分类上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Spectrum通过结合扩散模型和纹理生成技术，显著提升了细粒度人体解析的性能。

Abstract: Existing methods for human parsing into body parts and clothing often use
fixed mask categories with broad labels that obscure fine-grained clothing
types. Recent open-vocabulary segmentation approaches leverage pretrained
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model features for strong zero-shot transfer, but
typically group entire humans into a single person category, failing to
distinguish diverse clothing or detailed body parts. To address this, we
propose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts
and clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based
open-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal
representations are not specialized for detailed human parsing. We observe
that, unlike diffusion models with broad representations, image-driven 3D
texture generators maintain faithful correspondence to input images, enabling
stronger representations for parsing diverse clothing and body parts. Spectrum
introduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model --
obtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps -- for improved
alignment with body parts and clothing. From an input image, we extract
human-part internal features via the I2Tx diffusion model and generate
semantically valid masks aligned to diverse clothing categories through
prompt-guided grounding. Once trained, Spectrum produces semantic segmentation
maps for every visible body part and clothing category, ignoring standalone
garments or irrelevant objects, for any number of humans in the scene. We
conduct extensive cross-dataset experiments -- separately assessing body parts,
clothing parts, unseen clothing categories, and full-body masks -- and
demonstrate that Spectrum consistently outperforms baseline methods in
prompt-based segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate localization represents a fundamental challenge in

particularly in complex environments. In this work, we propose
  an innovative localization framework that harnesses flooring characteris tics
by employing graph-based representations and Graph Convolutional
  Networks (GCNs). Our method uses graphs to represent floor features,
  which helps localize the robot more accurately (0.64cm error) and more
  efficiently than comparing individual image features. Additionally, this
  approach successfully addresses the kidnapped robot problem in every
  frame without requiring complex filtering processes. These advancements
  open up new possibilities for robotic navigation in diverse environments.

Motivation: 现有文本引导图像编辑方法在速度和编辑质量上存在不足，InstantEdit旨在通过RectifiedFlow框架和新技术提升编辑效率和效果。

Method: 采用PerRFI反转策略、Inversion Latent Injection技术、Disentangled Prompt Guidance和Canny-conditioned ControlNet，结合RectifiedFlow框架实现快速编辑。

Result: 在PIE数据集上，InstantEdit在速度和编辑质量上均优于现有方法，实现了更一致和详细的编辑效果。

Conclusion: InstantEdit通过创新技术显著提升了文本引导图像编辑的速度和质量，为相关领域提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a fast text-guided image editing method called InstantEdit based
on the RectifiedFlow framework, which is structured as a few-step editing
process that preserves critical content while following closely to textual
instructions. Our approach leverages the straight sampling trajectories of
RectifiedFlow by introducing a specialized inversion strategy called PerRFI. To
maintain consistent while editable results for RectifiedFlow model, we further
propose a novel regeneration method, Inversion Latent Injection, which
effectively reuses latent information obtained during inversion to facilitate
more coherent and detailed regeneration. Additionally, we propose a
Disentangled Prompt Guidance technique to balance editability with detail
preservation, and integrate a Canny-conditioned ControlNet to incorporate
structural cues and suppress artifacts. Evaluation on the PIE image editing
dataset demonstrates that InstantEdit is not only fast but also achieves better
qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art few-step
editing methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度的增强技术Depth-Jitter，通过模拟自然深度变化提升模型泛化能力，并在实验中验证了其对深度敏感环境的稳定性提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统增强技术忽略了深度感知变换，限制了模型在真实世界深度变化中的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用自适应深度偏移技术，基于深度方差阈值生成合成深度扰动，同时保持结构完整性。

Result: 在FathomNet和UTDAC2020数据集上验证，Depth-Jitter虽未在绝对性能上始终超越传统方法，但显著提升了模型在深度敏感环境中的稳定性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Depth-Jitter为深度感知增强提供了新思路，支持进一步研究深度相关学习策略。

Abstract: Depth information is essential in computer vision, particularly in underwater
imaging, robotics, and autonomous navigation. However, conventional
augmentation techniques overlook depth aware transformations, limiting model
robustness in real world depth variations. In this paper, we introduce
Depth-Jitter, a novel depth-based augmentation technique that simulates natural
depth variations to improve generalization. Our approach applies adaptive depth
offsetting, guided by depth variance thresholds, to generate synthetic depth
perturbations while preserving structural integrity. We evaluate Depth-Jitter
on two benchmark datasets, FathomNet and UTDAC2020 demonstrating its impact on
model stability under diverse depth conditions. Extensive experiments compare
Depth-Jitter against traditional augmentation strategies such as ColorJitter,
analyzing performance across varying learning rates, encoders, and loss
functions. While Depth-Jitter does not always outperform conventional methods
in absolute performance, it consistently enhances model stability and
generalization in depth-sensitive environments. These findings highlight the
potential of depth-aware augmentation for real-world applications and provide a
foundation for further research into depth-based learning strategies. The
proposed technique is publicly available to support advancements in depth-aware
augmentation. The code is publicly available on

Abstract: In this paper, we present our solution for the semi-supervised learning track
(MER-SEMI) in MER2025. We propose a comprehensive framework, grounded in the
principle that "more is better," to construct a robust Mixture of Experts (MoE)
emotion recognition system. Our approach integrates a diverse range of input
modalities as independent experts, including novel signals such as knowledge
from large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and temporal Action Unit (AU)
information. To effectively utilize unlabeled data, we introduce a
consensus-based pseudo-labeling strategy, generating high-quality labels from
the agreement between a baseline model and Gemini, which are then used in a
two-stage training paradigm. Finally, we employ a multi-expert voting ensemble
combined with a rule-based re-ranking process to correct prediction bias and
better align the outputs with human preferences. Evaluated on the MER2025-SEMI
challenge dataset, our method achieves an F1-score of 0.8772 on the test set,
ranking 2nd in the track. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fourier-VLM通过频域压缩视觉表征，显著减少计算开销和推理延迟，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在减少视觉特征数量时往往牺牲性能或增加额外成本，而视觉特征的低频成分能量集中，为频域压缩提供了可能。

Method: 使用二维离散余弦变换（DCT）对视觉特征进行低通滤波，通过FFT高效计算，不引入额外参数。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，推理FLOPs减少83.8%，生成速度提升31.2%。

Conclusion: Fourier-VLM在高效性和实用性上表现突出，适用于多种架构。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically replace the predefined image
placeholder token (<image>) in textual instructions with visual features from
an image encoder, forming the input to a backbone Large Language Model (LLM).
However, the large number of vision tokens significantly increases the context
length, leading to high computational overhead and inference latency. While
previous efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or
leveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise
performance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose
Fourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual
representations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the
observation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit
concentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a
low-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimentional Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$,
minimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional
parameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks
demonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong
generalizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures. Crucially, it
reduce inference FLOPs by up to 83.8% and boots generation speed by 31.2%
compared to LLaVA-v1.5, highlighting the superior efficiency and practicality.

Motivation: 现有方法生成整个目标图像，导致计算成本高且非编辑区域的重建偏差影响编辑质量。

Method: 通过预训练任意顺序自回归文本到图像（T2I）模型，实现零样本图像编辑，并适应NEP方法。

Result: 在广泛使用的图像编辑基准测试中达到新最优性能，并支持零样本迭代优化。

Conclusion: NEP方法显著提升了图像编辑的效率和质量，支持零样本测试时扩展。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing involves modifying a source image based on a
language instruction and, typically, requires changes to only small local
regions. However, existing approaches generate the entire target image rather
than selectively regenerate only the intended editing areas. This results in
(1) unnecessary computational costs and (2) a bias toward reconstructing
non-editing regions, which compromises the quality of the intended edits. To
resolve these limitations, we propose to formulate image editing as Next
Editing-token Prediction (NEP) based on autoregressive image generation, where
only regions that need to be edited are regenerated, thus avoiding unintended
modification to the non-editing areas. To enable any-region editing, we propose
to pre-train an any-order autoregressive text-to-image (T2I) model. Once
trained, it is capable of zero-shot image editing and can be easily adapted to
NEP for image editing, which achieves a new state-of-the-art on widely used
image editing benchmarks. Moreover, our model naturally supports test-time
scaling (TTS) through iteratively refining its generation in a zero-shot
manner. The project page is: https://nep-bigai.github.io/

TL;DR: VQAThinker是一个基于推理的视频质量评估框架，利用大型多模态模型和强化学习解决现有模型的泛化性和可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估模型在泛化性和可解释性上存在不足，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 采用GRPO强化学习算法，结合三种VQA特定奖励（回归、排序和时间一致性），模拟人类感知决策。

Result: 在领域内和OOD基准测试中表现优异，泛化能力强，且在质量理解和描述任务中优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 强化学习为仅依赖分数级监督构建泛化性强且可解释的VQA模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) aims to objectively quantify perceptual
quality degradation in alignment with human visual perception. Despite recent
advances, existing VQA models still suffer from two critical limitations:
\textit{poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) videos} and
\textit{limited explainability}, which restrict their applicability in
real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{VQAThinker}, a reasoning-based VQA framework that leverages large
multimodal models (LMMs) with reinforcement learning to jointly model video
quality understanding and scoring, emulating human perceptual decision-making.
Specifically, we adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-guided
reinforcement learning algorithm that enables reasoning over video quality
under score-level supervision, and introduce three VQA-specific rewards: (1) a
\textbf{bell-shaped regression reward} that increases rapidly as the prediction
error decreases and becomes progressively less sensitive near the ground truth;
(2) a \textbf{pairwise ranking reward} that guides the model to correctly
determine the relative quality between video pairs; and (3) a \textbf{temporal
consistency reward} that encourages the model to prefer temporally coherent
videos over their perturbed counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD
VQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring.
Furthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its
superiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to
existing explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that
reinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building
generalizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is closer than ever to becoming a
reality, sparking widespread enthusiasm in the research community to collect
and work with various modalities, including text, image, video, and audio.
Despite recent efforts, satellite spectral imagery, as an additional modality,
has yet to receive the attention it deserves. This area presents unique
challenges, but also holds great promise in advancing the capabilities of AGI
in understanding the natural world. In this paper, we argue why Earth
Observation data is useful for an intelligent model, and then we review
existing benchmarks and highlight their limitations in evaluating the
generalization ability of foundation models in this domain. This paper
emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive benchmark to evaluate earth
observation models. To facilitate this, we propose a comprehensive set of tasks
that a benchmark should encompass to effectively assess a model's ability to
understand and interact with Earth observation data.

Motivation: HybridEVS相机结合Quad Bayer CFA传感器和事件像素时，缺乏颜色信息导致去马赛克过程中出现伪影和混叠问题，现有方法难以在资源有限的移动设备上解决这些问题。

Method: TSANet采用两阶段网络设计，分别处理事件像素修复和去马赛克，并引入轻量级的Cross-Swin State Block，利用位置先验和状态空间模型增强全局依赖关系。

Result: TSANet在模拟和真实HybridEVS数据上表现出色，PSNR和SSIM优于现有方法DemosaicFormer，同时参数和计算成本分别降低1.86倍和3.29倍。

Conclusion: TSANet为移动设备上的高效图像去马赛克提供了新思路，模型轻量且性能优越。

Abstract: Event cameras like the Hybrid Event-based Vision Sensor (HybridEVS) camera
capture brightness changes as asynchronous "events" instead of frames, offering
advanced application on mobile photography. However, challenges arise from
combining a Quad Bayer Color Filter Array (CFA) sensor with event pixels
lacking color information, resulting in aliasing and artifacts on the
demosaicing process before downstream application. Current methods struggle to
address these issues, especially on resource-limited mobile devices. In
response, we introduce \textbf{TSANet}, a lightweight \textbf{T}wo-stage
network via \textbf{S}tate space augmented cross-\textbf{A}ttention, which can
handle event pixels inpainting and demosaicing separately, leveraging the
benefits of dividing complex tasks into manageable subtasks. Furthermore, we
introduce a lightweight Cross-Swin State Block that uniquely utilizes
positional prior for demosaicing and enhances global dependencies through the
state space model with linear complexity. In summary, TSANet demonstrates
excellent demosaicing performance on both simulated and real data of HybridEVS
while maintaining a lightweight model, averaging better results than the
previous state-of-the-art method DemosaicFormer across seven diverse datasets
in both PSNR and SSIM, while respectively reducing parameter and computation
costs by $1.86\times$ and $3.29\times$. Our approach presents new possibilities
for efficient image demosaicing on mobile devices. Code is available in the
supplementary materials.

Motivation: 显著目标和伪装目标检测任务具有矛盾属性，传统观点认为联合学习会降低性能，但作者认为通过正确方法可以实现双赢。

Method: 提出SCJoint联合学习方案，通过任务特定参数解耦矛盾属性，并设计SBSS策略平衡训练集。

Result: 实验证明JoNet网络能同时捕捉显著和伪装目标，性能优越。

Conclusion: SCJoint和SBSS有效解决了联合学习中的矛盾问题，提升了任务性能。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) and camouflaged object detection (COD) are two
closely related but distinct computer vision tasks. Although both are
class-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the
former aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter
focuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the
background in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory
attributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these
two tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks.
However, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to
learning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both
salient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint
learning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,
assuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution
characteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and
variances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal
amount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network
structure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at
a minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy
(SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set
sizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and
shortens the training time. Based on the proposed SCJoint and SBSS, we train a
powerful generalist network, named JoNet, which has the ability to
simultaneously capture both ``salient" and ``camouflaged". Extensive
experiments demonstrate the competitive performance and effectiveness of our
proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/linuxsino/JoNet.

Result: 专家与大众投票一致，90%模型无法生成基本人形点光源运动。

Conclusion: BioMotion Arena是一个灵活且具有挑战性的性能可视化评估框架。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large models and manifesting their gaps are
challenging. Current benchmarks adopt either ground-truth-based score-form
evaluation on static datasets or indistinct textual chatbot-style human
preferences collection, which may not provide users with immediate, intuitive,
and perceptible feedback on performance differences. In this paper, we
introduce BioMotion Arena, a novel framework for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via visual
animation. Our methodology draws inspiration from the inherent visual
perception of motion patterns characteristic of living organisms that utilizes
point-light source imaging to amplify the performance discrepancies between
models. Specifically, we employ a pairwise comparison evaluation and collect
more than 45k votes for 53 mainstream LLMs and MLLMs on 90 biological motion
variants. Data analyses show that the crowd-sourced human votes are in good
agreement with those of expert raters, demonstrating the superiority of our
BioMotion Arena in offering discriminative feedback. We also find that over
90\% of evaluated models, including the cutting-edge open-source InternVL3 and
proprietary Claude-4 series, fail to produce fundamental humanoid point-light
groups, much less smooth and biologically plausible motions. This enables
BioMotion Arena to serve as a challenging benchmark for performance
visualization and a flexible evaluation framework without restrictions on
ground-truth.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TD治疗方法依赖低分辨率MR扫描和外科医生经验，手术效果不一致且微创技术应用有限。

Method: 使用隐式神经表示（INR）生成超分辨率MR体积，多标签网络分割骨骼，小波扩散模型（WDM）生成伪健康目标形态。

Result: 在25例TD患者中验证，显著改善了滑车角度（SA）和滑车沟深度（TGD）。

Conclusion: 该方法无需CT扫描，减少了辐射，生成了亚毫米级3D形态，适用于术前和术中规划。

Abstract: To treat Trochlear Dysplasia (TD), current approaches rely mainly on
low-resolution clinical Magnetic Resonance (MR) scans and surgical intuition.
The surgeries are planned based on surgeons experience, have limited adoption
of minimally invasive techniques, and lead to inconsistent outcomes. We propose
a pipeline that generates super-resolved, patient-specific 3D pseudo-healthy
target morphologies from conventional clinical MR scans. First, we compute an
isotropic super-resolved MR volume using an Implicit Neural Representation
(INR). Next, we segment femur, tibia, patella, and fibula with a multi-label
custom-trained network. Finally, we train a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) to
generate pseudo-healthy target morphologies of the trochlear region. In
contrast to prior work producing pseudo-healthy low-resolution 3D MR images,
our approach enables the generation of sub-millimeter resolved 3D shapes
compatible for pre- and intraoperative use. These can serve as preoperative
blueprints for reshaping the femoral groove while preserving the native patella
articulation. Furthermore, and in contrast to other work, we do not require a
CT for our pipeline - reducing the amount of radiation. We evaluated our
approach on 25 TD patients and could show that our target morphologies
significantly improve the sulcus angle (SA) and trochlear groove depth (TGD).

TL;DR: DreamVE是一个基于指令的统一图像和视频编辑模型，采用两阶段训练策略，结合拼贴和生成模型的数据合成方法，提升编辑性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于指令的视频编辑因训练数据不足而受限的问题，推动其实际应用。

Method: 提出两阶段训练策略（先图像后视频），结合拼贴和生成模型的数据合成方法，并设计高效的编辑框架。

Result: DreamVE在关键编辑类型中表现优异，具备良好的泛化和迁移能力，但属性编辑性能稍弱。

Conclusion: DreamVE通过统一图像和视频编辑，结合多种数据合成方法，为指令式编辑提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction-based editing holds vast potential due to its simple and
efficient interactive editing format. However, instruction-based editing,
particularly for video, has been constrained by limited training data,
hindering its practical application. To this end, we introduce DreamVE, a
unified model for instruction-based image and video editing. Specifically, We
propose a two-stage training strategy: first image editing, then video editing.
This offers two main benefits: (1) Image data scales more easily, and models
are more efficient to train, providing useful priors for faster and better
video editing training. (2) Unifying image and video generation is natural and
aligns with current trends. Moreover, we present comprehensive training data
synthesis pipelines, including collage-based and generative model-based data
synthesis. The collage-based data synthesis combines foreground objects and
backgrounds to generate diverse editing data, such as object manipulation,
background changes, and text modifications. It can easily generate billions of
accurate, consistent, realistic, and diverse editing pairs. We pretrain DreamVE
on extensive collage-based data to achieve strong performance in key editing
types and enhance generalization and transfer capabilities. However,
collage-based data lacks some attribute editing cases, leading to a relative
drop in performance. In contrast, the generative model-based pipeline, despite
being hard to scale up, offers flexibility in handling attribute editing cases.
Therefore, we use generative model-based data to further fine-tune DreamVE.
Besides, we design an efficient and powerful editing framework for DreamVE. We
build on the SOTA T2V model and use a token concatenation with early drop
approach to inject source image guidance, ensuring strong consistency and
editability. The codes and models will be released.

TL;DR: SwiftVideo是一个统一的蒸馏框架，结合轨迹保留和分布匹配策略，显著加速视频生成模型，同时保持高质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有蒸馏方法在少步设置下性能下降或产生更多伪影，需要一种更稳定的加速方案。

Method: 引入连续时间一致性蒸馏确保ODE轨迹精确保留，并提出双视角对齐（分布对齐和轨迹对齐）。

Result: 在OpenVid-1M基准测试中，SwiftVideo显著优于现有方法，实现少步高质量视频生成。

Conclusion: SwiftVideo通过统一框架解决了现有蒸馏方法的局限性，为高效视频生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion-based or flow-based models have achieved significant progress in
video synthesis but require multiple iterative sampling steps, which incurs
substantial computational overhead. While many distillation methods that are
solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been
developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer
from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and
stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of
trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach
introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise
preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective
alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data
along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method
maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number
of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
few-step video generation.

TL;DR: 提出AdaptInfer框架，通过动态文本引导剪枝和跨模态注意力分析，显著降低视觉语言模型推理成本，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法未能充分利用推理过程中的动态内部信号，导致视觉语言模型推理成本高。

Method: 提出动态文本引导剪枝机制和基于跨模态注意力分析的剪枝策略。

Result: CUDA延迟降低61.3%，平均精度保持92.9%，在相同token预算下超越SOTA。

Conclusion: AdaptInfer是一种轻量级、即插即用且通用的方法，显著提升了视觉语言模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on
multimodal reasoning tasks such as visual question answering (VQA), but their
inference cost remains a significant challenge due to the large number of
vision tokens processed during the prefill stage. Existing pruning methods
often rely on directly using the attention patterns or static text prompt
guidance, failing to exploit the dynamic internal signals generated during
inference. To address these issues, we propose AdaptInfer, a plug-and-play
framework for adaptive vision token pruning in VLMs. First, we introduce a
fine-grained, dynamic text-guided pruning mechanism that reuses layer-wise
text-to-text attention maps to construct soft priors over text-token
importance, allowing more informed scoring of vision tokens at each stage.
Second, we perform an offline analysis of cross-modal attention shifts and
identify consistent inflection locations in inference, which inspire us to
propose a more principled and efficient pruning schedule. Our method is
lightweight and plug-and-play, also generalizable across multi-modal tasks.
Experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.
For example, it reduces CUDA latency by 61.3\% while maintaining an average
accuracy of 92.9\% on vanilla LLaVA-1.5-7B. Under the same token budget,
AdaptInfer surpasses SOTA in accuracy.

TL;DR: Q-CLIP是一个基于视觉语言模型（VLMs）的视频质量评估（VQA）框架，通过共享跨模态适配器（SCMA）和可学习的质量提示，显著降低了计算成本并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VQA方法依赖于大规模分类数据集的预训练，但存在语义知识迁移不足和计算资源消耗大的问题。VLMs在视觉任务中表现出色，因此探索其在VQA中的应用。

Method: 提出Q-CLIP框架，使用SCMA增强视觉和文本表示，仅需训练少量参数；引入五个可学习的质量提示；研究帧采样策略的影响。

Result: Q-CLIP在多个VQA数据集上表现优异，计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: Q-CLIP为VQA提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案，展示了VLMs在质量评估中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient Video Quality Assessment (VQA) has long been a key
research challenge. Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve
performance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,
ImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this
strategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic
knowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality
depends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);
(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational
resources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training
directly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown
remarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and
have begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this
work, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP
enhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal
Adapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters
and is the only component that requires training. This design significantly
reduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable
quality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality
variations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality.
Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies
on VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to
better generalization performance across datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Q-CLIP exhibits excellent performance on several VQA datasets.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能生成更自然、多样化的情感驱动反应动作，适用于交互任务。

Abstract: Emotion serves as an essential component in daily human interactions.
Existing human motion generation frameworks do not consider the impact of
emotions, which reduces naturalness and limits their application in interactive
tasks, such as human reaction synthesis. In this work, we introduce a novel
task: generating diverse reaction motions in response to different emotional
cues. However, learning emotion representation from limited motion data and
incorporating it into a motion generation framework remains a challenging
problem. To address the above obstacles, we introduce a semi-supervised emotion
prior in an actor-reactor diffusion model to facilitate emotion-driven reaction
synthesis. Specifically, based on the observation that motion clips within a
short sequence tend to share the same emotion, we first devise a
semi-supervised learning framework to train an emotion prior. With this prior,
we further train an actor-reactor diffusion model to generate reactions by
considering both spatial interaction and emotional response. Finally, given a
motion sequence of an actor, our approach can generate realistic reactions
under various emotional conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model outperforms existing reaction generation methods. The code and data will
be made publicly available at https://ereact.github.io/

Result: 在CROHME基准测试中，该方法优于现有自监督和全监督基线，验证了渐进注意力机制的有效性。

Conclusion: 自监督学习框架结合渐进注意力机制显著提升了HMER性能，减少了对标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions (HMER) is a challenging task
due to the inherent two-dimensional structure, varying symbol scales, and
complex spatial relationships among symbols. In this paper, we present a
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for HMER that eliminates the need for
expensive labeled data. Our approach begins by pretraining an image encoder
using a combination of global and local contrastive loss, enabling the model to
learn both holistic and fine-grained representations. A key contribution of
this work is a novel self-supervised attention network, which is trained using
a progressive spatial masking strategy. This attention mechanism is designed to
learn semantically meaningful focus regions, such as operators, exponents, and
nested mathematical notation, without requiring any supervision. The
progressive masking curriculum encourages the network to become increasingly
robust to missing or occluded visual information, ultimately improving
structural understanding. Our complete pipeline consists of (1) self-supervised
pretraining of the encoder, (2) self-supervised attention learning, and (3)
supervised fine-tuning with a transformer decoder to generate LATEX sequences.
Extensive experiments on CROHME benchmarks demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing SSL and fully supervised baselines, validating the
effectiveness of our progressive attention mechanism in enhancing HMER
performance. Our codebase can be found here.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字时代中，高级图像编辑工具威胁视觉内容的真实性，现有IML方法依赖大规模标注数据，但数据集规模不足且多样性有限，限制了模型性能。

Method: 提出UGD-IML框架，利用扩散模型学习数据分布，通过类别嵌入机制和参数共享设计，实现IML和CIML任务的统一处理。

Result: 在多个数据集上，UGD-IML在IML和CIML任务中的F1指标分别平均优于现有方法9.66和4.36。

Conclusion: UGD-IML框架通过生成模型减少数据依赖，统一任务处理，并在性能和鲁棒性上表现优异。

Abstract: In the digital age, advanced image editing tools pose a serious threat to the
integrity of visual content, making image forgery detection and localization a
key research focus. Most existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods
rely on discriminative learning and require large, high-quality annotated
datasets. However, current datasets lack sufficient scale and diversity,
limiting model performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, recent
studies have explored Constrained IML (CIML), which generates pixel-level
annotations through algorithmic supervision. However, existing CIML approaches
often depend on complex multi-stage pipelines, making the annotation process
inefficient. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework based on
diffusion models, named UGD-IML, which for the first time unifies both IML and
CIML tasks within a single framework. By learning the underlying data
distribution, generative diffusion models inherently reduce the reliance on
large-scale labeled datasets, allowing our approach to perform effectively even
under limited data conditions. In addition, by leveraging a class embedding
mechanism and a parameter-sharing design, our model seamlessly switches between
IML and CIML modes without extra components or training overhead. Furthermore,
the end-to-end design enables our model to avoid cumbersome steps in the data
annotation process. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets
demonstrate that UGD-IML outperforms the SOTA methods by an average of 9.66 and
4.36 in terms of F1 metrics for IML and CIML tasks, respectively. Moreover, the
proposed method also excels in uncertainty estimation, visualization and
robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络（DNNs）内部表示不透明的问题，并改进FMCE方法缺乏实验验证和闭环集成的局限性。

Method: 提出FMCE-Net++框架，利用预训练的FMCE-Net生成特征图收敛分数（FMCS），结合任务标签通过表示辅助损失（RAL）动态优化主干网络。

Result: 在多个数据集（MNIST、CIFAR-10等）上验证，FMCE-Net++显著提升模型性能（如ResNet-50/CIFAR-10准确率提升1.16个百分点）。

Conclusion: FMCE-Net++能有效提升现有模型的性能上限，无需架构修改或额外数据。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) face interpretability challenges due to their
opaque internal representations. While Feature Map Convergence Evaluation
(FMCE) quantifies module-level convergence via Feature Map Convergence Scores
(FMCS), it lacks experimental validation and closed-loop integration. To
address this limitation, we propose FMCE-Net++, a novel training framework that
integrates a pretrained, frozen FMCE-Net as an auxiliary head. This module
generates FMCS predictions, which, combined with task labels, jointly supervise
backbone optimization through a Representation Auxiliary Loss. The RAL
dynamically balances the primary classification loss and feature convergence
optimization via a tunable \Representation Abstraction Factor. Extensive
experiments conducted on MNIST, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-100
demonstrate that FMCE-Net++ consistently enhances model performance without
architectural modifications or additional data. Key experimental outcomes
include accuracy gains of $+1.16$ pp (ResNet-50/CIFAR-10) and $+1.08$ pp
(ShuffleNet v2/CIFAR-100), validating that FMCE-Net++ can effectively elevate
state-of-the-art performance ceilings.

Abstract: With the increasing availability of 2D and 3D data, significant advancements
have been made in the field of cross-modal retrieval. Nevertheless, the
existence of imperfect annotations presents considerable challenges, demanding
robust solutions for 2D-3D cross-modal retrieval in the presence of noisy label
conditions. Existing methods generally address the issue of noise by dividing
samples independently within each modality, making them susceptible to
overfitting on corrupted labels. To address these issues, we propose a robust
2D-3D \textbf{M}ulti-level cross-modal adaptive \textbf{C}orrection and
\textbf{A}lignment framework (MCA). Specifically, we introduce a Multimodal
Joint label Correction (MJC) mechanism that leverages multimodal historical
self-predictions to jointly model the modality prediction consistency, enabling
reliable label refinement. Additionally, we propose a Multi-level Adaptive
Alignment (MAA) strategy to effectively enhance cross-modal feature semantics
and discrimination across different levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our method, MCA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both conventional and realistic noisy 3D benchmarks, highlighting its
generality and effectiveness.

Result: ECD数据集显著提升了多种MLLM在真实和合成测试集上的性能。

Conclusion: 模块化图表生成和多样化视觉细节能有效提升图表理解能力，ECD数据集为相关研究提供了高质量资源。

Abstract: Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a
central part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are
still falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging
benchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are
often restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could
compromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this
study, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual
details improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a
five-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation
for single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on
earlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated
figures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer
(QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of
fine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which
contains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring
250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD
consistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world
and synthetic test sets. Code, data and models are available at:

Conclusion: 显式3D眼球结构显著提升了注视重定向的真实感和准确性。

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D gaze redirection framework that leverages an explicit
3D eyeball structure. Existing gaze redirection methods are typically based on
neural radiance fields, which employ implicit neural representations via volume
rendering. Unlike these NeRF-based approaches, where the rotation and
translation of 3D representations are not explicitly modeled, we introduce a
dedicated 3D eyeball structure to represent the eyeballs with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). Our method generates photorealistic images that faithfully
reproduce the desired gaze direction by explicitly rotating and translating the
3D eyeball structure. In addition, we propose an adaptive deformation module
that enables the replication of subtle muscle movements around the eyes.
Through experiments conducted on the ETH-XGaze dataset, we demonstrate that our
framework is capable of generating diverse novel gaze images, achieving
superior image quality and gaze estimation accuracy compared to previous
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 开放词汇语义分割面临语义类别广泛且细粒度的挑战，现有弱监督方法依赖类别特定监督和不适合对比学习的特征构建方法，导致语义对齐不佳。

Method: SynSeg采用MCCL策略结合FSS框架，通过融合先验和语义激活图增强来重构特征，避免视觉编码器引入的前景偏差。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SynSeg表现优于现有方法，例如在VOC上准确率提升4.5%，Context上提升8.9%。

Conclusion: SynSeg在弱监督下显著提升了语义定位和区分能力，为开放词汇语义分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in open-vocabulary scenarios presents significant
challenges due to the wide range and granularity of semantic categories.
Existing weakly-supervised methods often rely on category-specific supervision
and ill-suited feature construction methods for contrastive learning, leading
to semantic misalignment and poor performance. In this work, we propose a novel
weakly-supervised approach, SynSeg, to address the challenges. SynSeg performs
Multi-Category Contrastive Learning (MCCL) as a stronger training signal with a
new feature reconstruction framework named Feature Synergy Structure (FSS).
Specifically, MCCL strategy robustly combines both intra- and inter-category
alignment and separation in order to make the model learn the knowledge of
correlations from different categories within the same image. Moreover, FSS
reconstructs discriminative features for contrastive learning through prior
fusion and semantic-activation-map enhancement, effectively avoiding the
foreground bias introduced by the visual encoder. In general, SynSeg
effectively improves the abilities in semantic localization and discrimination
under weak supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For instance,
SynSeg achieves higher accuracy than SOTA baselines by 4.5\% on VOC, 8.9\% on
Context, 2.6\% on Object and 2.0\% on City.

Conclusion: UW-3DGS通过物理模型和自适应修剪，显著提升了水下3D重建的精度和效率，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Underwater 3D scene reconstruction faces severe challenges from light
absorption, scattering, and turbidity, which degrade geometry and color
fidelity in traditional methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). While NeRF
extensions such as SeaThru-NeRF incorporate physics-based models, their MLP
reliance limits efficiency and spatial resolution in hazy environments. We
introduce UW-3DGS, a novel framework adapting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for
robust underwater reconstruction. Key innovations include: (1) a plug-and-play
learnable underwater image formation module using voxel-based regression for
spatially varying attenuation and backscatter; and (2) a Physics-Aware
Uncertainty Pruning (PAUP) branch that adaptively removes noisy floating
Gaussians via uncertainty scoring, ensuring artifact-free geometry. The
pipeline operates in training and rendering stages. During training, noisy
Gaussians are optimized end-to-end with underwater parameters, guided by PAUP
pruning and scattering modeling. In rendering, refined Gaussians produce clean
Unattenuated Radiance Images (URIs) free from media effects, while learned
physics enable realistic Underwater Images (UWIs) with accurate light
transport. Experiments on SeaThru-NeRF and UWBundle datasets show superior
performance, achieving PSNR of 27.604, SSIM of 0.868, and LPIPS of 0.104 on
SeaThru-NeRF, with ~65% reduction in floating artifacts.

Abstract: This study applied representation learning algorithms to satellite images and
evaluated the learned latent spaces with classifications of various weather

pre-trained with large image datasets (PT). The experiment results indicated
that the latent space learned by CAE consistently showed higher threat scores
for all classification tasks. The classifications with PCA yielded high hit
rates but also high false-alarm rates. In addition, the PT performed
exceptionally well at recognizing tropical cyclones but was inferior in other
tasks. Further experiments suggested that representations learned from
higher-resolution datasets are superior in all classification tasks for
deep-learning algorithms, i.e., CAE and PT. We also found that smaller latent
space sizes had minor impact on the classification task's hit rate. Still, a
latent space dimension smaller than 128 caused a significantly higher false
alarm rate. Though the CAE can learn latent spaces effectively and efficiently,
the interpretation of the learned representation lacks direct connections to
physical attributions. Therefore, developing a physics-informed version of CAE
can be a promising outlook for the current work.

Abstract: Colonoscopy is a vital tool for the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer,
which is one of the main causes of cancer-related mortality globally; hence, it
is deemed an essential technique for the prevention and early detection of
colorectal cancer. The research introduces a unique multidirectional
architectural framework to automate polyp detection within colonoscopy images
while helping resolve limited healthcare dataset sizes and annotation
complexities. The research implements a comprehensive system that delivers
synthetic data generation through Stable Diffusion enhancements together with
detection and segmentation algorithms. This detection approach combines Faster
R-CNN for initial object localization while the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
refines the segmentation masks. The faster R-CNN detection algorithm achieved a
recall of 93.08% combined with a precision of 88.97% and an F1 score of
90.98%.SAM is then used to generate the image mask. The research evaluated five
state-of-the-art segmentation models that included U-Net, PSPNet, FPN, LinkNet,
and MANet using ResNet34 as a base model. The results demonstrate the superior
performance of FPN with the highest scores of PSNR (7.205893) and SSIM
(0.492381), while UNet excels in recall (84.85%) and LinkNet shows balanced
performance in IoU (64.20%) and Dice score (77.53%).

TL;DR: SC-Captioner是一个通过强化学习框架实现图像描述模型自我纠正能力的系统，通过设计奖励函数激励准确修正，显著提升描述质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像描述模型缺乏自我纠正能力，导致生成的描述可能存在错误或不准确。SC-Captioner旨在通过强化学习框架解决这一问题。

Method: 使用场景图解析算法将预测和参考描述分解为对象、属性和关系集合，通过集合差异计算奖励函数，激励准确修正并惩罚错误。

Result: 实验表明，SC-Captioner在多种场景下生成的图像描述质量显著优于直接偏好优化训练策略。

Conclusion: SC-Captioner通过自我纠正机制显著提升了图像描述模型的性能，为图像描述任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose SC-Captioner, a reinforcement learning framework that enables the
self-correcting capability of image caption models. Our crucial technique lies
in the design of the reward function to incentivize accurate caption
corrections. Specifically, the predicted and reference captions are decomposed
into object, attribute, and relation sets using scene-graph parsing algorithms.
We calculate the set difference between sets of initial and self-corrected
captions to identify added and removed elements. These elements are matched
against the reference sets to calculate correctness bonuses for accurate
refinements and mistake punishments for wrong additions and removals, thereby
forming the final reward. For image caption quality assessment, we propose a
set of metrics refined from CAPTURE that alleviate its incomplete precision
evaluation and inefficient relation matching problems. Furthermore, we collect
a fine-grained annotated image caption dataset, RefinedCaps, consisting of 6.5K
diverse images from COCO dataset. Experiments show that applying SC-Captioner
on large visual-language models can generate better image captions across
various scenarios, significantly outperforming the direct preference
optimization training strategy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LiLoRA的高效架构扩展方法，用于解决多模态大语言模型在持续视觉指令调优中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续视觉指令调优（CVIT）中，模型在学习新任务时容易遗忘旧任务，现有方法通过扩展架构来缓解遗忘，但参数开销大且扩展性差。

Method: LiLoRA通过共享LoRA矩阵A、对矩阵B进行低秩分解以减少任务特定参数，并引入余弦正则化稳定性损失来保持共享表示的一致性。

Result: 实验表明，LiLoRA在连续任务学习中表现优异，且参数效率显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LiLoRA是一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，适用于多模态大语言模型的持续学习任务。

Abstract: Continual Visual Instruction Tuning (CVIT) enables Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks over time. However, this
process is challenged by catastrophic forgetting, where performance on
previously learned tasks deteriorates as the model adapts to new ones. A common
approach to mitigate forgetting is architecture expansion, which introduces
task-specific modules to prevent interference. Yet, existing methods often
expand entire layers for each task, leading to significant parameter overhead
and poor scalability. To overcome these issues, we introduce LoRA in LoRA
(LiLoRA), a highly efficient architecture expansion method tailored for CVIT in
MLLMs. LiLoRA shares the LoRA matrix A across tasks to reduce redundancy,
applies an additional low-rank decomposition to matrix B to minimize
task-specific parameters, and incorporates a cosine-regularized stability loss
to preserve consistency in shared representations over time. Extensive
experiments on a diverse CVIT benchmark show that LiLoRA consistently achieves
superior performance in sequential task learning while significantly improving
parameter efficiency compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: VeSCA是一种新方法，通过利用SAM的编码器生成可转移的对抗样本，解决了SAM的漏洞问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM的零样本能力虽然强大，但其漏洞可能导致下游应用失败，因此需要主动评估这些漏洞。

Method: VeSCA通过参数化单纯复形和顶点细化迭代，识别共享脆弱区域，并引入轻量级域适应策略。

Result: 实验表明，VeSCA在多个下游模型和数据集上性能提升12.7%。

Conclusion: 研究强调了SAM漏洞对下游模型的风险，呼吁开发更鲁棒的基础模型。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) transforms interactive segmentation
with zero-shot abilities, its inherent vulnerabilities present a single-point
risk, potentially leading to the failure of numerous downstream applications.
Proactively evaluating these transferable vulnerabilities is thus imperative.
Prior adversarial attacks on SAM often present limited transferability due to
insufficient exploration of common weakness across domains. To address this, we
propose Vertex-Refining Simplicial Complex Attack (VeSCA), a novel method that
leverages only the encoder of SAM for generating transferable adversarial
examples. Specifically, it achieves this by explicitly characterizing the
shared vulnerable regions between SAM and downstream models through a
parametric simplicial complex. Our goal is to identify such complexes within
adversarially potent regions by iterative vertex-wise refinement. A lightweight
domain re-adaptation strategy is introduced to bridge domain divergence using
minimal reference data during the initialization of simplicial complex.
Ultimately, VeSCA generates consistently transferable adversarial examples
through random simplicial complex sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VeSCA achieves performance improved by 12.7% compared to state-of-the-art
methods across three downstream model categories across five domain-specific
datasets. Our findings further highlight the downstream model risks posed by
SAM's vulnerabilities and emphasize the urgency of developing more robust
foundation models.

Conclusion: 提出的扩散模型框架有效融合了IMU和视觉信号，解决了视觉信息偶尔失效的问题，实现了高性能的实时运动捕捉。

Abstract: Combining sparse IMUs and a monocular camera is a new promising setting to
perform real-time human motion capture. This paper proposes a diffusion-based
solution to learn human motion priors and fuse the two modalities of signals
together seamlessly in a unified framework. By delicately considering the
characteristics of the two signals, the sequential visual information is
considered as a whole and transformed into a condition embedding, while the
inertial measurement is concatenated with the noisy body pose frame by frame to
construct a sequential input for the diffusion model. Firstly, we observe that
the visual information may be unavailable in some frames due to occlusions or
subjects moving out of the camera view. Thus incorporating the sequential
visual features as a whole to get a single feature embedding is robust to the
occasional degenerations of visual information in those frames. On the other
hand, the IMU measurements are robust to occlusions and always stable when
signal transmission has no problem. So incorporating them frame-wisely could
better explore the temporal information for the system. Experiments have
demonstrated the effectiveness of the system design and its state-of-the-art
performance in pose estimation compared with the previous works. Our codes are

Conclusion: SIFThinker通过动态修正和聚焦机制，显著提升了复杂视觉任务的性能，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant
challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained
perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however,
they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively
refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce
SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human
visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and
image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural
language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a
reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of
interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which
in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose
GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual
grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically
correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding
and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general
capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 现有数据集可能因MLLM发展而过时或存在数据污染问题，亟需动态评估方法。

Result: 实验表明SDEval显著影响安全评估，减轻数据污染，并暴露MLLMs的安全局限。

Conclusion: SDEval具有通用性，适用于现有安全和能力基准，为MLLMs安全评估提供新思路。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), the safety concerns of their outputs have earned significant
attention. Although numerous datasets have been proposed, they may become
outdated with MLLM advancements and are susceptible to data contamination
issues. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{SDEval}, the
\textit{first} safety dynamic evaluation framework to controllably adjust the
distribution and complexity of safety benchmarks. Specifically, SDEval mainly
adopts three dynamic strategies: text, image, and text-image dynamics to
generate new samples from original benchmarks. We first explore the individual
effects of text and image dynamics on model safety. Then, we find that
injecting text dynamics into images can further impact safety, and conversely,
injecting image dynamics into text also leads to safety risks. SDEval is
general enough to be applied to various existing safety and even capability
benchmarks. Experiments across safety benchmarks, MLLMGuard and VLSBench, and
capability benchmarks, MMBench and MMVet, show that SDEval significantly
influences safety evaluation, mitigates data contamination, and exposes safety
limitations of MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hq-King/SDEval

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前弱监督视频异常检测模型难以处理复杂异常事件，且缺乏类别特异性建模和精确的时序信息。

Method: 提出GS-MoE框架，结合专家模型和时序高斯损失，增强弱监督信号并捕捉类别特异性特征。

Result: 在UCF-Crime、XD-Violence和MSAD数据集上达到91.58% AUC，性能领先。

Conclusion: GS-MoE通过类别特异性专家和时序引导，为弱监督视频异常检测设定了新标准。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a challenging task due to the variability of
anomalous events and the limited availability of labeled data. Under the
Weakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided
during training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although
state-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions),
they struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This
difficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to
address the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a
shared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak
supervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the
ability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To
address these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of
Experts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each
specialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a
temporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal
consistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach
encourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by
focusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The
predictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a
mixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse
anomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a
91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on
XD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and
temporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.

Result: Prompt-DINO在开放世界检测基准上实现了最先进的性能，语义覆盖范围显著扩大，标签噪声减少80.5%。

Conclusion: Prompt-DINO为开放世界场景中的可扩展多模态检测和数据生成建立了新范式。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal vision models have highlighted limitations
in late-stage feature fusion and suboptimal query selection for hybrid prompts
open-world segmentation, alongside constraints from caption-derived
vocabularies. To address these challenges, we propose Prompt-DINO, a
text-guided visual Prompt DINO framework featuring three key innovations.
First, we introduce an early fusion mechanism that unifies text/visual prompts
and backbone features at the initial encoding stage, enabling deeper
cross-modal interactions to resolve semantic ambiguities. Second, we design
order-aligned query selection for DETR-based architectures, explicitly
optimizing the structural alignment between text and visual queries during
decoding to enhance semantic-spatial consistency. Third, we develop a
generative data engine powered by the Recognize Anything via Prompting (RAP)
model, which synthesizes 0.5B diverse training instances through a dual-path
cross-verification pipeline, reducing label noise by 80.5% compared to
conventional approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prompt-DINO
achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-world detection benchmarks while
significantly expanding semantic coverage beyond fixed-vocabulary constraints.

Motivation: 现有方法多依赖标准卷积，而自适应卷积能更好地利用遥感图像的像素相关性，但研究较少。

Method: 提出DSConv，动态分割卷积核并结合注意力机制，增强特征提取能力。

Result: 实验证明DSConv在泛化性、优化和特征表示方面表现优异，达到先进水平。

Conclusion: DSConv在图像融合任务中表现出优越性，并明确了其最佳使用条件。

Abstract: Aiming to obtain a high-resolution image, pansharpening involves the fusion
of a multi-spectral image (MS) and a panchromatic image (PAN), the low-level
vision task remaining significant and challenging in contemporary research.
Most existing approaches rely predominantly on standard convolutions, few
making the effort to adaptive convolutions, which are effective owing to the
inter-pixel correlations of remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a
novel strategy for dynamically splitting convolution kernels in conjunction
with attention, selecting positions of interest, and splitting the original
convolution kernel into multiple smaller kernels, named DSConv. The proposed
DSConv more effectively extracts features of different positions within the
receptive field, enhancing the network's generalization, optimization, and
feature representation capabilities. Furthermore, we innovate and enrich
concepts of dynamic splitting convolution and provide a novel network
architecture for pansharpening capable of achieving the tasks more efficiently,
building upon this methodology. Adequate fair experiments illustrate the
effectiveness and the state-of-the-art performance attained by
DSConv.Comprehensive and rigorous discussions proved the superiority and
optimal usage conditions of DSConv.

Result: 实验表明方法适用于多种图像质量（如模糊、低分辨率等），且在不同人口群体中效果一致。

Conclusion: 新方法能有效减少误识别，且仅在使用先进损失函数训练的匹配器中有效。

Abstract: A central problem in one-to-many facial identification is that the person in
the probe image may or may not have enrolled image(s) in the gallery; that is,
may be In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Past approaches to detect when a rank-one
result is Out-of-gallery have mostly focused on finding a suitable threshold on
the similarity score. We take a new approach, using the additional enrolled
images of the identity with the rank-one result to predict if the rank-one
result is In-gallery / Out-of-gallery. Given a gallery of identities and
images, we generate In-gallery and Out-of-gallery training data by extracting
the ranks of additional enrolled images corresponding to the rank-one identity.
We then train a classifier to utilize this feature vector to predict whether a
rank-one result is In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Using two different datasets
and four different matchers, we present experimental results showing that our
approach is viable for mugshot quality probe images, and also, importantly, for
probes degraded by blur, reduced resolution, atmospheric turbulence and
sunglasses. We also analyze results across demographic groups, and show that
In-gallery / Out-of-gallery classification accuracy is similar across
demographics. Our approach has the potential to provide an objective estimate
of whether a one-to-many facial identification is Out-of-gallery, and thereby
to reduce false positive identifications, wrongful arrests, and wasted
investigative time. Interestingly, comparing the results of older deep
CNN-based face matchers with newer ones suggests that the effectiveness of our
Out-of-gallery detection approach emerges only with matchers trained using
advanced margin-based loss functions.

Result: 指标与人类评估一致性高（>75%），HWPQ在抽象语义上达到85.9%准确率。评估显示无通用最优模型，角色加权分数提供领域部署指导。

Conclusion: VISTAR为T2I评估提供了更全面、用户中心的方法，公开资源促进可重复研究。

Abstract: We present VISTAR, a user-centric, multi-dimensional benchmark for
text-to-image (T2I) evaluation that addresses the limitations of existing
metrics. VISTAR introduces a two-tier hybrid paradigm: it employs
deterministic, scriptable metrics for physically quantifiable attributes (e.g.,
text rendering, lighting) and a novel Hierarchical Weighted P/N Questioning
(HWPQ) scheme that uses constrained vision-language models to assess abstract
semantics (e.g., style fusion, cultural fidelity). Grounded in a Delphi study
with 120 experts, we defined seven user roles and nine evaluation angles to
construct the benchmark, which comprises 2,845 prompts validated by over 15,000
human pairwise comparisons. Our metrics achieve high human alignment (>75%),
with the HWPQ scheme reaching 85.9% accuracy on abstract semantics,
significantly outperforming VQA baselines. Comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art models reveals no universal champion, as role-weighted scores
reorder rankings and provide actionable guidance for domain-specific
deployment. All resources are publicly released to foster reproducible T2I
assessment.

Abstract: High-resolution imagery plays a critical role in improving the performance of
visual recognition tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation.
In many domains, including remote sensing and surveillance, low-resolution
images can limit the accuracy of automated analysis. To address this,
super-resolution (SR) techniques have been widely adopted to attempt to
reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. Related
traditional approaches focus solely on enhancing image quality based on
pixel-level metrics, leaving the relationship between super-resolved image
fidelity and downstream classification performance largely underexplored. This
raises a key question: can integrating classification objectives directly into
the super-resolution process further improve classification accuracy? In this
paper, we try to respond to this question by investigating the relationship
between super-resolution and classification through the deployment of a
specialised algorithmic strategy. We propose a novel methodology that increases
the resolution of synthetic aperture radar imagery by optimising loss functions
that account for both image quality and classification performance. Our
approach improves image quality, as measured by scientifically ascertained
image quality indicators, while also enhancing classification accuracy.

Conclusion: MPF-KANSC显著提升AD诊断能力，具有良好可解释性。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
severely impairs cognitive function and quality of life. Timely intervention in
AD relies heavily on early and precise diagnosis, which remains challenging due
to the complex and subtle structural changes in the brain. Most existing deep
learning methods focus only on a single plane of structural magnetic resonance
imaging (sMRI) and struggle to accurately capture the complex and nonlinear
relationships among pathological regions of the brain, thus limiting their
ability to precisely identify atrophic features. To overcome these limitations,
we propose an innovative framework, MPF-KANSC, which integrates multi-plane
fusion (MPF) for combining features from the coronal, sagittal, and axial
planes, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-guided spatial-channel attention
mechanism (KANSC) to more effectively learn and represent sMRI atrophy
features. Specifically, the proposed model enables parallel feature extraction
from multiple anatomical planes, thus capturing more comprehensive structural
information. The KANSC attention mechanism further leverages a more flexible
and accurate nonlinear function approximation technique, facilitating precise
identification and localization of disease-related abnormalities. Experiments
on the ADNI dataset confirm that the proposed MPF-KANSC achieves superior
performance in AD diagnosis. Moreover, our findings provide new evidence of
right-lateralized asymmetry in subcortical structural changes during AD
progression, highlighting the model's promising interpretability.

Method: 提出PostDiff框架，包括混合分辨率去噪方案和混合模块缓存策略，以减少输入和模块级别的冗余。

Result: 实验表明，PostDiff显著提升了扩散模型的效率-保真度权衡，且降低每步推理成本比减少去噪步骤更有效。

Conclusion: PostDiff为预训练扩散模型提供了一种无需训练的高效加速方法，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across generative tasks, yet
their high computational demands challenge deployment on resource-limited
platforms. This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal
diffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning,
is it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a
cheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps
increases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model
more sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes
the differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training
compression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff,
a training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by
reducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training
manner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme
based on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising
steps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation
fidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to
reuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the
fidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to
boost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing
per-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of
denoising steps. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于GAN的半监督学习框架，针对医学影像中标记数据不足的问题，通过集成生成器、判别器和分类器，结合伪标签技术，显著提升了低标记数据条件下的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像领域因标记数据不足而导致的深度学习模型性能受限问题。

Method: 采用GAN框架，结合生成器、判别器和分类器，通过三阶段训练（监督学习、无监督学习和伪标签技术）利用未标记数据。

Result: 在11个MedMNIST数据集上，该方法在5到50标记样本/类的设置中均优于现有方法，尤其在5-shot场景下表现突出。

Conclusion: 该框架为医学影像提供了一种高效的低标记数据解决方案，显著提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized medical imaging, but its effectiveness is
severely limited by insufficient labeled training data. This paper introduces a
novel GAN-based semi-supervised learning framework specifically designed for
low labeled-data regimes, evaluated across settings with 5 to 50 labeled
samples per class. Our approach integrates three specialized neural networks --
a generator for class-conditioned image translation, a discriminator for
authenticity assessment and classification, and a dedicated classifier --
within a three-phase training framework. The method alternates between
supervised training on limited labeled data and unsupervised learning that
leverages abundant unlabeled images through image-to-image translation rather
than generation from noise. We employ ensemble-based pseudo-labeling that
combines confidence-weighted predictions from the discriminator and classifier
with temporal consistency through exponential moving averaging, enabling
reliable label estimation for unlabeled data. Comprehensive evaluation across
eleven MedMNIST datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves statistically
significant improvements over six state-of-the-art GAN-based semi-supervised
methods, with particularly strong performance in the extreme 5-shot setting
where the scarcity of labeled data is most challenging. The framework maintains
its superiority across all evaluated settings (5, 10, 20, and 50 shots per
class). Our approach offers a practical solution for medical imaging
applications where annotation costs are prohibitive, enabling robust
classification performance even with minimal labeled data. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模自然图像-文本数据集语义对齐松散和医学数据集内容多样性低的问题，以提升CLIP模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出CLIPin插件，设计共享预投影器，结合对比和非对比学习。

Result: 在多样化下游任务中验证了CLIPin的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: CLIPin是一种即插即用的组件，兼容多种对比框架。

Abstract: Large-scale natural image-text datasets, especially those automatically
collected from the web, often suffer from loose semantic alignment due to weak
supervision, while medical datasets tend to have high cross-modal correlation
but low content diversity. These properties pose a common challenge for
contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP): they hinder the model's ability
to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we propose
CLIPin, a unified non-contrastive plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated
into CLIP-style architectures to improve multimodal semantic alignment,
providing stronger supervision and enhancing alignment robustness. Furthermore,
two shared pre-projectors are designed for image and text modalities
respectively to facilitate the integration of contrastive and non-contrastive
learning in a parameter-compromise manner. Extensive experiments on diverse
downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLIPin as a
plug-and-play component compatible with various contrastive frameworks. Code is

Conclusion: MA-CFP框架在犯罪预测和公共安全领域具有显著潜力。

Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, criminal behavior in public scenes
poses an increasingly serious threat to social security. Traditional anomaly
detection methods based on feature recognition struggle to capture high-level
behavioral semantics from historical information, while generative approaches
based on Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to meet real-time
requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MA-CBP, a criminal
behavior prediction framework based on multi-agent asynchronous collaboration.
This framework transforms real-time video streams into frame-level semantic
descriptions, constructs causally consistent historical summaries, and fuses
adjacent image frames to perform joint reasoning over long- and short-term
contexts. The resulting behavioral decisions include key elements such as event
subjects, locations, and causes, enabling early warning of potential criminal
activity. In addition, we construct a high-quality criminal behavior dataset
that provides multi-scale language supervision, including frame-level,
summary-level, and event-level semantic annotations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on multiple datasets
and offers a promising solution for risk warning in urban public safety
scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DBIF-AUNet的双分支交互融合注意力模型，用于解决胸水CT图像语义分割中的挑战，包括灰度相似、边缘模糊和形态多变等问题。通过DDFD模块和BIAF模块的协同作用，模型在多尺度特征互补和动态特征融合方面表现优异，最终在验证集上取得了优于现有方法的分割精度。

Motivation: 胸水CT图像的语义分割对临床诊断和治疗至关重要，但现有方法在处理灰度相似、边缘模糊和形态多变等问题时效果不佳。

Method: 提出DBIF-AUNet模型，包含DDFD模块（双域特征解耦）和BIAF模块（分支交互注意力融合），并采用嵌套深度监督机制和分层自适应混合损失。

Result: 在1,622张胸水CT图像上的验证结果显示，IoU和Dice分数分别为80.1%和89.0%，优于U-Net++和Swin-UNet。

Conclusion: DBIF-AUNet在复杂胸水CT图像分割中表现出显著优势，为临床诊断提供了更精确的工具。

Abstract: Pleural effusion semantic segmentation can significantly enhance the accuracy
and timeliness of clinical diagnosis and treatment by precisely identifying
disease severity and lesion areas. Currently, semantic segmentation of pleural
effusion CT images faces multiple challenges. These include similar gray levels
between effusion and surrounding tissues, blurred edges, and variable
morphology. Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and
complex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic
gaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive
Fusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested
skip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature
Disentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the
functions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity
and enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a
Branch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically
with the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and
frequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness.
Furthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical
adaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance. Through validation
on 1,622 pleural effusion CT images from Southwest Hospital, DBIF-AUNet
achieved IoU and Dice scores of 80.1% and 89.0% respectively. These results
outperform state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models U-Net++ and
Swin-UNet by 5.7%/2.7% and 2.2%/1.5% respectively, demonstrating significant
optimization in segmentation accuracy for complex pleural effusion CT images.

Conclusion: Text-Swin-UMamba模型在病灶分割任务中表现优异，为临床评估提供了新工具。

Abstract: Segmentation of lesions on CT enables automatic measurement for clinical
assessment of chronic diseases (e.g., lymphoma). Integrating large language
models (LLMs) into the lesion segmentation workflow offers the potential to
combine imaging features with descriptions of lesion characteristics from the
radiology reports. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of integrating
text into the Swin-UMamba architecture for the task of lesion segmentation. The
publicly available ULS23 DeepLesion dataset was used along with short-form
descriptions of the findings from the reports. On the test dataset, a high Dice
Score of 82% and low Hausdorff distance of 6.58 (pixels) was obtained for
lesion segmentation. The proposed Text-Swin-UMamba model outperformed prior
approaches: 37% improvement over the LLM-driven LanGuideMedSeg model (p <
0.001),and surpassed the purely image-based xLSTM-UNet and nnUNet models by

TL;DR: AnomalyMoE是一个基于Mixture-of-Experts架构的通用异常检测框架，通过分层设计和专家模块优化，显著提升了跨领域异常检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法高度专业化，限制了其泛化能力，需要一种通用框架来解决多种异常类型。

Method: AnomalyMoE将异常检测分解为三个语义层次（局部、组件、全局），并采用三个专家网络分别处理，同时引入EIR和ESB模块优化专家多样性和利用率。

Result: 在8个跨领域数据集上，AnomalyMoE显著优于专业方法，达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: AnomalyMoE通过分层和模块化设计，实现了通用且高效的异常检测，为跨领域应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task across numerous domains and modalities,
yet existing methods are often highly specialized, limiting their
generalizability. These specialized models, tailored for specific anomaly types
like textural defects or logical errors, typically exhibit limited performance
when deployed outside their designated contexts. To overcome this limitation,
we propose AnomalyMoE, a novel and universal anomaly detection framework based
on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our key insight is to decompose the
complex anomaly detection problem into three distinct semantic hierarchies:
local structural anomalies, component-level semantic anomalies, and global
logical anomalies. AnomalyMoE correspondingly employs three dedicated expert
networks at the patch, component, and global levels, and is specialized in
reconstructing features and identifying deviations at its designated semantic
level. This hierarchical design allows a single model to concurrently
understand and detect a wide spectrum of anomalies. Furthermore, we introduce
an Expert Information Repulsion (EIR) module to promote expert diversity and an
Expert Selection Balancing (ESB) module to ensure the comprehensive utilization
of all experts. Experiments on 8 challenging datasets spanning industrial
imaging, 3D point clouds, medical imaging, video surveillance, and logical
anomaly detection demonstrate that AnomalyMoE establishes new state-of-the-art
performance, significantly outperforming specialized methods in their
respective domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市化、气候变化和农业压力增加了对精确和及时环境监测的需求，而现有遥感系统在空间和时间分辨率之间存在权衡。

Method: WGAST采用条件生成对抗网络架构，包括特征提取、融合、LST重建和噪声抑制四个阶段，并结合弱监督训练策略。

Result: WGAST在定量和定性评估中均优于现有方法，平均降低RMSE 17.18%，提高SSIM 11.00%，并能有效捕捉细尺度热模式。

Conclusion: WGAST是首个端到端深度学习框架，能够高效估计高分辨率LST，并在实际应用中表现出鲁棒性。

Abstract: Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the
demand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface
Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from
remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer
promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m
resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative
Network for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra
MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning
framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative
adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature
extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage
employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from
the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,
normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the
fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to
suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy
based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN
discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods
in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the
best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves
SSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and
effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33
ground-based sensors. The code is available at

Method: 构建了包含562个运动序列的PA-HOI数据集，涵盖不同性别受试者与35种3D物体的交互。

Result: 数据集显著扩展了对物体物理属性如何影响人类姿势、速度和交互策略的理解。

Conclusion: PA-HOI数据集能够与现有运动生成方法结合，验证其传递真实物理感知的能力。

Abstract: The Human-Object Interaction (HOI) task explores the dynamic interactions
between humans and objects in physical environments, providing essential
biomechanical and cognitive-behavioral foundations for fields such as robotics,
virtual reality, and human-computer interaction. However, existing HOI data
sets focus on details of affordance, often neglecting the influence of physical
properties of objects on human long-term motion. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the PA-HOI Motion Capture dataset, which highlights the impact of
objects' physical attributes on human motion dynamics, including human posture,
moving velocity, and other motion characteristics. The dataset comprises 562
motion sequences of human-object interactions, with each sequence performed by
subjects of different genders interacting with 35 3D objects that vary in size,
shape, and weight. This dataset stands out by significantly extending the scope
of existing ones for understanding how the physical attributes of different
objects influence human posture, speed, motion scale, and interacting
strategies. We further demonstrate the applicability of the PA-HOI dataset by
integrating it with existing motion generation methods, validating its capacity
to transfer realistic physical awareness.

Result: 最佳模型PCC达0.943，RMSE为15.73；集成学习后PCC提升至0.945，RMSE降至15.57，接近专家水平。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别与RA进展相关的解剖结构，决策依据与临床医生一致。

Abstract: The Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) score has been widely used in clinical trials
to quantify radiographic damage in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), but its
complexity has limited its adoption in routine clinical practice. To address
the inefficiency of manual scoring, this work proposes a two-stage pipeline for
interpretable image-level SvdH score prediction using dual-hand radiographs.
Our approach extracts disease-relevant image regions and integrates them using
attention-based multiple instance learning to generate image-level features for
prediction. We propose two region extraction schemes: 1) sampling image tiles
most likely to contain abnormalities, and 2) cropping patches containing
disease-relevant joints. With Scheme 2, our best individual score prediction
model achieved a Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.943 and a root
mean squared error (RMSE) of 15.73. Ensemble learning further boosted
prediction accuracy, yielding a PCC of 0.945 and RMSE of 15.57, achieving
state-of-the-art performance that is comparable to that of experienced
radiologists (PCC = 0.97, RMSE = 18.75). Finally, our pipeline effectively
identified and made decisions based on anatomical structures which clinicians
consider relevant to RA progression.

Motivation: 城市遥感图像中地物纹理差异小、空间结构相似，易导致语义模糊和误分类，且形状不规则、边界模糊等问题增加了分割难度。

Method: 设计了纹理感知模块（TaM）捕捉纹理差异，构建边缘引导三分支解码器（Eg3Head）保留边缘细节，并引入边缘引导特征融合模块（EgFFM）融合上下文和边缘信息。

Result: 在Potsdam、Vaihingen和LoveDA数据集上分别达到88.57%、81.46%和53.55%的mIoU。

Conclusion: TEFormer有效提升了城市遥感图像的语义分割精度。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of urban remote sensing images (URSIs) is crucial for
applications such as urban planning and environmental monitoring. However,
geospatial objects often exhibit subtle texture differences and similar spatial
structures, which can easily lead to semantic ambiguity and misclassification.
Moreover, challenges such as irregular object shapes, blurred boundaries, and
overlapping spatial distributions of semantic objects contribute to complex and
diverse edge morphologies, further complicating accurate segmentation. To
tackle these issues, we propose a texture-aware and edge-guided Transformer
(TEFormer) that integrates texture awareness and edge-guidance mechanisms for
semantic segmentation of URSIs. In the encoder, a texture-aware module (TaM) is
designed to capture fine-grained texture differences between visually similar
categories to enhance semantic discrimination. Then, an edge-guided tri-branch
decoder (Eg3Head) is constructed to preserve local edges and details for
multiscale context-awareness. Finally, an edge-guided feature fusion module
(EgFFM) is to fuse contextual and detail information with edge information to
realize refined semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments show that TEFormer
achieves mIoU of 88.57%, 81.46%, and 53.55% on the Potsdam, Vaihingen, and
LoveDA datasets, respectively, shows the effectiveness in URSI semantic
segmentation.

Abstract: Image deblurring, removing blurring artifacts from images, is a fundamental
task in computational photography and low-level computer vision. Existing
approaches focus on specialized solutions tailored to particular blur types,
thus, these solutions lack generalization. This limitation in current methods
implies requiring multiple models to cover several blur types, which is not
practical in many real scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the first
all-in-one deblurring method capable of efficiently restoring images affected
by diverse blur degradations, including global motion, local motion, blur in
low-light conditions, and defocus blur. We propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE)
decoding module, which dynamically routes image features based on the
recognized blur degradation, enabling precise and efficient restoration in an
end-to-end manner. Our unified approach not only achieves performance
comparable to dedicated task-specific models, but also demonstrates remarkable
robustness and generalization capabilities on unseen blur degradation
scenarios.

Conclusion: 通过最小化修改预训练CLIP模型，实现了高效的深度伪造检测泛化，证明了参数高效方法的潜力。

Abstract: The generalization of deepfake detectors to unseen manipulation techniques
remains a challenge for practical deployment. Although many approaches adapt
foundation models by introducing significant architectural complexity, this
work demonstrates that robust generalization is achievable through a
parameter-efficient adaptation of a pre-trained CLIP vision encoder. The
proposed method, LNCLIP-DF, fine-tunes only the Layer Normalization parameters
(0.03% of the total) and enhances generalization by enforcing a hyperspherical
feature manifold using L2 normalization and latent space augmentations.
  We conducted an extensive evaluation on 13 benchmark datasets spanning from
2019 to 2025. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming more complex, recent approaches in average cross-dataset AUROC.
Our analysis yields two primary findings for the field: 1) training on paired
real-fake data from the same source video is essential for mitigating shortcut
learning and improving generalization, and 2) detection difficulty on academic
datasets has not strictly increased over time, with models trained on older,
diverse datasets showing strong generalization capabilities.
  This work delivers a computationally efficient and reproducible method,
proving that state-of-the-art generalization is attainable by making targeted,
minimal changes to a pre-trained CLIP model. The code will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

Method: FedX利用反向传播解释方法评估模型组件的重要性，剪枝最不相关的部分以减少传输数据量。

Result: 实验表明，FedX显著减少了共享参数数量，同时提升了全局模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedX是一种有效的联邦学习优化方法，适用于遥感任务。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables the collaborative training of deep neural
networks across decentralized data archives (i.e., clients), where each client
stores data locally and only shares model updates with a central server. This
makes FL a suitable learning paradigm for remote sensing (RS) image
classification tasks, where data centralization may be restricted due to legal
and privacy constraints. However, a key challenge in applying FL to RS tasks is
the communication overhead caused by the frequent exchange of large model
updates between clients and the central server. To address this issue, in this
paper we propose a novel strategy (denoted as FedX) that uses
explanation-guided pruning to reduce communication overhead by minimizing the
size of the transmitted models without compromising performance. FedX leverages
backpropagation-based explanation methods to estimate the task-specific
importance of model components and prunes the least relevant ones at the
central server. The resulting sparse global model is then sent to clients,
substantially reducing communication overhead. We evaluate FedX on multi-label
scene classification using the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset and single-label scene
classification using the EuroSAT dataset. Experimental results show the success
of FedX in significantly reducing the number of shared model parameters while
enhancing the generalization capability of the global model, compared to both
unpruned model and state-of-the-art pruning methods. The code of FedX will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D和3D深度学习方法在股骨MRI分割中存在局限性，影响了骨科诊断和手术规划的准确性。

Method: XAG-Net采用像素级跨切片注意力（CSA）和跳跃注意力门控（AG）机制，优化切片间上下文建模和切片内特征细化。

Result: XAG-Net在股骨分割精度上优于基线2D、2.5D和3D U-Net模型，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: XAG-Net通过CSA和AG模块的有效结合，为高效准确的股骨MRI分割提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of femur structures from Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) is critical for orthopedic diagnosis and surgical planning but remains
challenging due to the limitations of existing 2D and 3D deep learning-based
segmentation approaches. In this study, we propose XAG-Net, a novel 2.5D
U-Net-based architecture that incorporates pixel-wise cross-slice attention
(CSA) and skip attention gating (AG) mechanisms to enhance inter-slice
contextual modeling and intra-slice feature refinement. Unlike previous
CSA-based models, XAG-Net applies pixel-wise softmax attention across adjacent
slices at each spatial location for fine-grained inter-slice modeling.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that XAG-Net surpasses baseline 2D, 2.5D, and
3D U-Net models in femur segmentation accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of the CSA and
AG modules, establishing XAG-Net as a promising framework for efficient and
accurate femur MRI segmentation.

*Jian Hu,Zixu Cheng,Shaogang Gong,Isabel Guan,Jianye Hao,Jun Wang,Kun Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据高效的无标注跨域视频时间定位方法，通过不确定性量化策略适应（URPA）实现跨域知识迁移，无需目标域标注且计算开销低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如GRPO）依赖标注数据且计算开销大，难以在无标注域和实时场景中应用。

Method: 使用URPA方法，通过GRPO生成多个候选预测，形成伪标签并估计置信度，加权训练奖励以聚焦可靠监督。

Result: 在三个数据集的六种跨域设置中，URPA仅需少量无标注目标视频即可泛化良好。

Conclusion: URPA有效解决了无标注跨域视频时间定位问题，计算和存储开销低，适合实时部署。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (TG) aims to temporally locate video segments
matching a natural language description (a query) in a long video. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are effective at holistic semantic matching, they
often struggle with fine-grained temporal localisation. Recently, Group
Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) reformulates the inference process as a
reinforcement learning task, enabling fine-grained grounding and achieving
strong in-domain performance. However, GRPO relies on labelled data, making it
unsuitable in unlabelled domains. Moreover, because videos are large and
expensive to store and process, performing full-scale adaptation introduces
prohibitive latency and computational overhead, making it impractical for
real-time deployment. To overcome both problems, we introduce a Data-Efficient
Unlabelled Cross-domain Temporal Grounding method, from which a model is first
trained on a labelled source domain, then adapted to a target domain using only
a small number of unlabelled videos from the target domain. This approach
eliminates the need for target annotation and keeps both computational and
storage overhead low enough to run in real time. Specifically, we introduce.
Uncertainty-quantified Rollout Policy Adaptation (URPA) for cross-domain
knowledge transfer in learning video temporal grounding without target labels.
URPA generates multiple candidate predictions using GRPO rollouts, averages
them to form a pseudo label, and estimates confidence from the variance across
these rollouts. This confidence then weights the training rewards, guiding the
model to focus on reliable supervision. Experiments on three datasets across
six cross-domain settings show that URPA generalises well using only a few
unlabelled target videos. Codes will be released once published.

*Xin Ci Wong,Duygu Sarikaya,Kieran Zucker,Marc De Kamps,Nishant Ravikumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的方法，生成合成心脏MR图像以解决域偏移问题，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏MR图像因设备和协议差异导致域偏移，限制了AI模型在实际场景中的应用。传统方法如数据增强或迁移学习存在局限性。

Method: 使用扩散模型生成合成图像，保持结构和空间一致性，并用于训练域不变分割模型或域适应。

Result: 在未见目标域数据上，分割性能显著提升（p < 0.01）。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了域偏移问题，减少了对迁移学习的需求，适用于数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including cardiac MR, is prone to domain
shift due to variations in imaging devices and acquisition protocols. This
challenge limits the deployment of trained AI models in real-world scenarios,
where performance degrades on unseen domains. Traditional solutions involve
increasing the size of the dataset through ad-hoc image augmentation or
additional online training/transfer learning, which have several limitations.
Synthetic data offers a promising alternative, but anatomical/structural
consistency constraints limit the effectiveness of generative models in
creating image-label pairs. To address this, we propose a diffusion model (DM)
trained on a source domain that generates synthetic cardiac MR images that
resemble a given reference. The synthetic data maintains spatial and structural
fidelity, ensuring similarity to the source domain and compatibility with the
segmentation mask. We assess the utility of our generative approach in
multi-centre cardiac MR segmentation, using the 2D nnU-Net, 3D nnU-Net and
vanilla U-Net segmentation networks. We explore domain generalisation, where,
domain-invariant segmentation models are trained on synthetic source domain
data, and domain adaptation, where, we shift target domain data towards the
source domain using the DM. Both strategies significantly improved segmentation
performance on data from an unseen target domain, in terms of surface-based
metrics (Welch's t-test, p < 0.01), compared to training segmentation models on
real data alone. The proposed method ameliorates the need for transfer learning
or online training to address domain shift challenges in cardiac MR image
analysis, especially useful in data-scarce settings.

*Patrick Takenaka,Johannes Maucher,Marco F. Huber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 改进ViPro模型，使其能够从观察中正确推断状态，无需初始真实状态，并在无监督方式下实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ViPro模型因依赖初始真实状态而无法在噪声环境下估计状态的问题。

Method: 在ViPro基础上添加改进，使其能无监督地从观察中推断状态，并扩展Orbits数据集为3D版本。

Result: 模型能够无监督地从观察中推断状态，且适用于更接近真实场景的3D数据。

Conclusion: 改进后的ViPro模型在无监督状态下更鲁棒，适用于复杂动态场景。

Abstract: Predicting future video frames is a challenging task with many downstream
applications. Previous work has shown that procedural knowledge enables deep
models for complex dynamical settings, however their model ViPro assumed a
given ground truth initial symbolic state. We show that this approach led to
the model learning a shortcut that does not actually connect the observed
environment with the predicted symbolic state, resulting in the inability to
estimate states given an observation if previous states are noisy. In this
work, we add several improvements to ViPro that enables the model to correctly
infer states from observations without providing a full ground truth state in
the beginning. We show that this is possible in an unsupervised manner, and
extend the original Orbits dataset with a 3D variant to close the gap to real
world scenarios.

*Kieran Elrod,Katherine Flanigan,Mario Bergés*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究利用街景图像和大型语言模型分析城市社交互动质量，发现其与城市环境变量（如天空和绿化视野）及居民归属感相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注行人数量而非社交互动质量，街景图像作为低成本数据源可能隐含社交信息。

Method: 分析15个城市的2,998张街景图像，结合Mehta的社交分类理论，使用线性回归模型控制变量。

Result: 天空视野指数与所有社交类型相关，绿化视野指数预测持久社交，归属感与短暂社交正相关。

Conclusion: 街景图像可推断社交互动与建成环境的关系，为研究城市社交提供隐私保护工具。

Abstract: Designing socially active streets has long been a goal of urban planning, yet
existing quantitative research largely measures pedestrian volume rather than
the quality of social interactions. We hypothesize that street view imagery --
an inexpensive data source with global coverage -- contains latent social
information that can be extracted and interpreted through established social
science theory. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 2,998 street view images
from 15 cities using a multimodal large language model guided by Mehta's
taxonomy of passive, fleeting, and enduring sociability -- one illustrative
example of a theory grounded in urban design that could be substituted or
complemented by other sociological frameworks. We then used linear regression
models, controlling for factors like weather, time of day, and pedestrian
counts, to test whether the inferred sociability measures correlate with
city-level place attachment scores from the World Values Survey and with
environmental predictors (e.g., green, sky, and water view indices) derived
from individual street view images. Results aligned with long-standing urban
planning theory: the sky view index was associated with all three sociability
types, the green view index predicted enduring sociability, and place
attachment was positively associated with fleeting sociability. These results
provide preliminary evidence that street view images can be used to infer
relationships between specific types of social interactions and built
environment variables. Further research could establish street view imagery as
a scalable, privacy-preserving tool for studying urban sociability, enabling
cross-cultural theory testing and evidence-based design of socially vibrant
cities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频异常事件分析具有挑战性，现有模型因冗余信息和时空稀疏性表现不佳。

Method: 提出VA-GPT模型，结合SETS和TETG模块优化视觉与语言模型的令牌对齐。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VA-GPT通过有效令牌选择和跨域评估，显著提升了异常事件分析的准确性。

Abstract: Understanding abnormal events in videos is a vital and challenging task that
has garnered significant attention in a wide range of applications. Although
current video understanding Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are
capable of analyzing general videos, they often struggle to handle anomalies
due to the spatial and temporal sparsity of abnormal events, where the
redundant information always leads to suboptimal outcomes. To address these
challenges, exploiting the representation and generalization capabilities of
Vison Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose
VA-GPT, a novel MLLM designed for summarizing and localizing abnormal events in
various videos. Our approach efficiently aligns effective tokens between visual
encoders and LLMs through two key proposed modules: Spatial Effective Token
Selection (SETS) and Temporal Effective Token Generation (TETG). These modules
enable our model to effectively capture and analyze both spatial and temporal
information associated with abnormal events, resulting in more accurate
responses and interactions. Furthermore, we construct an instruction-following
dataset specifically for fine-tuning video-anomaly-aware MLLMs, and introduce a
cross-domain evaluation benchmark based on XD-Violence dataset. Our proposed
method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks.

Result: 实验展示了该算法在不同参数下的性能，验证了其高效性和适用性。

Conclusion: 本文成功实现并验证了一种高效的两阶段图像分割算法，为图像处理提供了新的工具。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe an implementation of the two-phase image
segmentation algorithm proposed by Goldstein, Bresson, Osher in
\cite{gold:bre}. This algorithm partitions the domain of a given 2d image into
foreground and background regions, and each pixel of the image is assigned
membership to one of these two regions. The underlying assumption for the
segmentation model is that the pixel values of the input image can be
summarized by two distinct average values, and that the region boundaries are
smooth. Accordingly, the model is defined as an energy in which the variable is
a region membership function to assign pixels to either region, originally
proposed by Chan and Vese in \cite{chan:vese}. This energy is the sum of image
data terms in the regions and a length penalty for region boundaries.
Goldstein, Bresson, Osher modify the energy of Chan-Vese in \cite{gold:bre} so
that their new energy can be minimized efficiently using the split Bregman
method to produce an equivalent two-phase segmentation. We provide a detailed
implementation of this method \cite{gold:bre}, and document its performance
with several images over a range of algorithm parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量模态特定标注数据或仅适用于单一模态，限制了通用性和扩展性。

Method: TaAM-CPT结合模态提示池、文本构建和预训练模型的模态对齐文本编码器，通过设计跨模态学习目标实现语义一致性。

Result: 无需模态特定标注数据，TaAM-CPT在视频、图像和音频分类任务中取得领先结果。

Conclusion: TaAM-CPT展示了仅用文本数据构建通用多模态模型的潜力，具有高度扩展性。

Abstract: The integration of prompt tuning with multimodal learning has shown
significant generalization abilities for various downstream tasks. Despite
advancements, existing methods heavily depend on massive modality-specific
labeled data (e.g., video, audio, and image), or are customized for a single
modality. In this study, we present Text as Any-Modality by Consistent Prompt
Tuning (TaAM-CPT), a scalable approach for constructing a general
representation model toward unlimited modalities using solely text data.
TaAM-CPT comprises modality prompt pools, text construction, and
modality-aligned text encoders from pre-trained models, which allows for
extending new modalities by simply adding prompt pools and modality-aligned
text encoders. To harmonize the learning across different modalities, TaAM-CPT
designs intra- and inter-modal learning objectives, which can capture category
details within modalities while maintaining semantic consistency across
different modalities. Benefiting from its scalable architecture and pre-trained
models, TaAM-CPT can be seamlessly extended to accommodate unlimited
modalities. Remarkably, without any modality-specific labeled data, TaAM-CPT
achieves leading results on diverse datasets spanning various modalities,
including video classification, image classification, and audio classification.

Conclusion: FVGen显著提升了稀疏输入视图下的时间效率，适用于下游重建任务。

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D reconstruction has enabled realistic 3D models from
dense image captures, yet challenges persist with sparse views, often leading
to artifacts in unseen areas. Recent works leverage Video Diffusion Models
(VDMs) to generate dense observations, filling the gaps when only sparse views
are available for 3D reconstruction tasks. A significant limitation of these
methods is their slow sampling speed when using VDMs. In this paper, we present
FVGen, a novel framework that addresses this challenge by enabling fast novel
view synthesis using VDMs in as few as four sampling steps. We propose a novel
video diffusion model distillation method that distills a multi-step denoising
teacher model into a few-step denoising student model using Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and softened reverse KL-divergence minimization.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that, compared to previous
works, our framework generates the same number of novel views with similar (or
even better) visual quality while reducing sampling time by more than 90%.
FVGen significantly improves time efficiency for downstream reconstruction
tasks, particularly when working with sparse input views (more than 2) where
pre-trained VDMs need to be run multiple times to achieve better spatial
coverage.

Abstract: SAR ship classification faces the challenge of long-tailed datasets, which
complicates the classification of underrepresented classes. Oversampling
methods have proven effective in addressing class imbalance in optical data. In
this paper, we evaluated the effect of oversampling in the feature space for
SAR ship classification. We propose two novel algorithms inspired by the

Additionally, we also analyzed the impact of oversampling methods on different
class sizes. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of our novel methods
over the original M2m and baselines, with an average F1-score increase of 8.82%
for FuSARShip and 4.44% for OpenSARShip.

improving lip synchronization, incorporating 3D facial modeling, and
introducing temporal consistency for video-based applications.

Conclusion: TRUST通过语言模态的鲁棒性和不确定性估计，显著提升了复杂域偏移下的适应性能。

Abstract: Recent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have shown great success
in addressing classical domain shifts (e.g., synthetic-to-real), but they still
suffer under complex shifts (e.g. geographical shift), where both the
background and object appearances differ significantly across domains. Prior
works showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process,
exhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce
TRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language
modality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates
pseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel
uncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to
estimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated
uncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the
adverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To
further increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal
soft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature
spaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision
model on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as
both a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are
attracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their
captions. This solution avoids the need for hardly determining positive and
negative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting. Our approach outperforms
previous methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on classical (DomainNet) and
complex (GeoNet) domain shifts. The code will be available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Recent approaches for 3D relighting have shown promise in integrating 2D
image relighting generative priors to alter the appearance of a 3D
representation while preserving the underlying structure. Nevertheless,
generative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input
image do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be
inferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar
relighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned
material-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary
number of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues
from inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material
information cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method
consistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with
diverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction
quality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly
relight from images. We further demonstrate that LightSwitch matches or
outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion inverse rendering methods in relighting
synthetic and real objects in as little as 2 minutes.

Motivation: 现有方法使用单一图表示形式（TRF）无法适应不同模型或任务的需求，导致回答不准确或冗长。

Method: 设计了一组零样本图QA专用的TRF（$F_{ZS}$），提出Graph Response Efficiency（GRE）指标，并开发DynamicTRF框架，包含TRF Preference（TRFP）数据集和TRF路由器。

Result: 在7个领域内算法图QA任务和2个领域外下游任务中，DynamicTRF显著提升了零样本图QA的准确性。

Conclusion: DynamicTRF通过动态选择最优TRF，有效提升了图QA任务的性能和效率。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown generalized zero-shot capabilities
in diverse domain question-answering (QA) tasks, including graph QA that
involves complex graph topologies. However, most current approaches use only a
single type of graph representation, namely Topology Representation Form (TRF),
such as prompt-unified text descriptions or style-fixed visual styles. Those
"one-size-fits-all" approaches fail to consider the specific preferences of
different models or tasks, often leading to incorrect or overly long responses.
To address this, we first analyze the characteristics and weaknesses of
existing TRFs, and then design a set of TRFs, denoted by $F_{ZS}$, tailored to
zero-shot graph QA. We then introduce a new metric, Graph Response Efficiency
(GRE), which measures the balance between the performance and the brevity in
graph QA. Built on these, we develop the DynamicTRF framework, which aims to
improve both the accuracy and conciseness of graph QA. To be specific,
DynamicTRF first creates a TRF Preference (TRFP) dataset that ranks TRFs based
on their GRE scores, to probe the question-specific TRF preferences. Then it
trains a TRF router on the TRFP dataset, to adaptively assign the best TRF from
$F_{ZS}$ for each question during the inference. Extensive experiments across 7
in-domain algorithmic graph QA tasks and 2 out-of-domain downstream tasks show
that DynamicTRF significantly enhances the zero-shot graph QA of LMMs in terms
of accuracy

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized content creation across
digital platforms, offering unprecedented capabilities in natural language
generation and understanding. These models enable beneficial applications such
as content generation, question and answering (Q&A), programming, and code
reasoning. Meanwhile, they also pose serious risks by inadvertently or
intentionally producing toxic, offensive, or biased content. This dual role of
LLMs, both as powerful tools for solving real-world problems and as potential
sources of harmful language, presents a pressing sociotechnical challenge. In
this survey, we systematically review recent studies spanning unintentional
toxicity, adversarial jailbreaking attacks, and content moderation techniques.
We propose a unified taxonomy of LLM-related harms and defenses, analyze
emerging multimodal and LLM-assisted jailbreak strategies, and assess
mitigation efforts, including reinforcement learning with human feedback
(RLHF), prompt engineering, and safety alignment. Our synthesis highlights the
evolving landscape of LLM safety, identifies limitations in current evaluation
methodologies, and outlines future research directions to guide the development
of robust and ethically aligned language technologies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个细粒度对话事实验证基准FineDialFact，用于检测LLM生成的对话中的幻觉问题，并展示了CoT推理方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的对话常包含幻觉（不准确或虚构信息），现有的事实验证方法过于粗粒度，无法有效处理混合事实的对话。

Method: 构建FineDialFact基准，基于公开对话数据集，提取原子事实进行验证，并测试多种基线方法，包括CoT推理。

Result: 实验显示CoT推理方法能提升性能，但在开放域对话数据集HybriDialogue上的最佳F1分数仅为0.75。

Conclusion: FineDialFact是一个具有挑战性的基准，未来研究需进一步改进。数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to produce hallucinations - factually
incorrect or fabricated information - which poses significant challenges for
many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as dialogue systems.
As a result, detecting hallucinations has become a critical area of research.
Current approaches to hallucination detection in dialogue systems primarily
focus on verifying the factual consistency of generated responses. However,
these responses often contain a mix of accurate, inaccurate or unverifiable
facts, making one factual label overly simplistic and coarse-grained. In this
paper, we introduce a benchmark, FineDialFact, for fine-grained dialogue fact
verification, which involves verifying atomic facts extracted from dialogue
responses. To support this, we construct a dataset based on publicly available
dialogue datasets and evaluate it using various baseline methods. Experimental
results demonstrate that methods incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
can enhance performance in dialogue fact verification. Despite this, the best
F1-score achieved on the HybriDialogue, an open-domain dialogue dataset, is
only 0.75, indicating that the benchmark remains a challenging task for future
research. Our dataset and code will be public on GitHub.

*Abishek Thamma,Micha Heilbron*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了短暂记忆对人类语言学习的潜在益处，通过对比实验发现，短暂记忆提升了语言模型性能，但意外地降低了人类阅读时间的预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认知科学认为记忆限制可能有助于语言学习，但Transformer模型的成功似乎挑战了这一观点。研究旨在验证短暂记忆对语言学习的影响。

Method: 在Transformer语言模型上进行了严格控制实验，比较了有短暂记忆和无短暂记忆模型在语言学习任务中的表现。

Result: 短暂记忆提升了语言模型的整体性能和句法评估表现，但降低了基于惊讶值的人类阅读时间预测准确性。

Conclusion: 短暂记忆对神经网络语言学习有益，但对行为预测无益，且这种差异无法用现有理论解释。

Abstract: Human memory is fleeting. As words are processed, the exact wordforms that
make up incoming sentences are rapidly lost. Cognitive scientists have long
believed that this limitation of memory may, paradoxically, help in learning
language - an idea supported by classic connectionist modelling work. The rise
of Transformers appears to challenge this idea, as these models can learn
language effectively, despite lacking memory limitations or other architectural
recency biases. Here, we investigate the hypothesized benefit of fleeting
memory for language learning in tightly controlled experiments on transformer
language models. Training transformers with and without fleeting memory on a
developmentally realistic training set, we find that fleeting memory
consistently improves language learning (as quantified by both overall language
modelling performance and targeted syntactic evaluation) but, unexpectedly,
impairs surprisal-based prediction of human reading times. Interestingly,
follow up analyses revealed that this discrepancy - better language modeling,
yet worse reading time prediction - could not be accounted for by prior
explanations of why better language models sometimes fit human reading time
worse. Together, these results support a benefit of memory limitations on
neural network language learning - but not on predicting behavior.

### [104] ["Mirror" Language AI Models of Depression are Criterion-Contaminated](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05830)
*Tong Li,Rasiq Hussain,Mehak Gupta,Joshua R. Oltmanns*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，基于语言的大模型（LLM）在预测抑郁评分时，直接使用抑郁评估的语言响应（Mirror模型）会导致效应量虚假膨胀，降低模型泛化性。相比之下，使用非直接相关语言（Non-Mirror模型）的预测效果较小但更可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Mirror模型因‘标准污染’导致的效应量膨胀问题，以及Non-Mirror模型在抑郁评估中的潜在优势。

Method: 比较Mirror模型（基于结构化诊断访谈）和Non-Mirror模型（基于生活史访谈）在预测抑郁评分时的表现，使用GPT-4、GPT-4o和LLaMA3-70B进行分析。

Result: Mirror模型效应量显著（R²=0.80），但Non-Mirror模型更可靠（R²=0.27）。两者在预测自报抑郁症状时表现相似（r≈0.54），表明Mirror模型存在偏差。

Conclusion: Mirror模型因标准污染效应量膨胀，泛化性较差；Non-Mirror模型更具解释性和实用性，未来抑郁评估中应优先考虑。

Abstract: A growing number of studies show near-perfect LLM language-based prediction
of depression assessment scores (up to R2 of .70). However, many develop these
models directly from language responses to depression assessments. These
"Mirror models" suffer from "criterion contamination", which arises when a
predicted score depends in part on the predictors themselves. This causes
artificial effect size inflation which reduces model generalizability. The
present study compares the performance of Mirror models versus "Non-Mirror
models", which are developed from language that does not mirror the assessment
they are developed to predict. N = 110 research participants completed two
different interviews: structured diagnostic and life history interviews. GPT-4,
GPT-4o and LLaMA3-70B were then prompted to predict structured diagnostic
interview depression scores from the two transcripts separately. Mirror models
(using structured diagnostic data) showed very large effect sizes (e.g., R2 =
.80). As expected, NonMirror models (using life history data) demonstrated
smaller effect sizes, but were relatively large (e.g., R2 = .27). When Mirror
and Non-Mirror model-predicted structured interview depression scores were
correlated with self-reported depression symptoms, Mirror and NonMirror
performed the same (e.g., r = ~.54), indicating that Mirror models contain bias
perhaps due to criterion contamination. Topic modeling identified clusters
across Mirror and Non-Mirror models, as well as between true-positive and
false-positive predictions. In this head-to-head comparison study, Mirror
language AI models of depression showed artificially inflated effect sizes and
less generalizability. As language AI models for depression continue to evolve,
incorporating Non-Mirror models may identify interpretable, and generalizable
semantic features that have unique utility in real-world psychological
assessment.

TL;DR: 论文重新解读了基于深度神经网络的涌现通信（EmCom）实验，通过小词汇量约束模拟双重分节，并提出类似自然语言屈折形态的新设置，探索了自然语言中的拼接性和融合性特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过模拟自然语言的屈折形态特征，更深入地理解涌现通信与人类语言的相似性，弥补现有EmCom研究在语言结构多样性上的不足。

Method: 在属性-值重构游戏中引入小词汇量约束，模拟双重分节，并设计新的实验设置和指标，探索拼接性和融合性特征。

Result: 实验发现，模拟的音系约束促进了拼接性形态，而涌现语言倾向于融合语法属性，与自然语言特征一致。

Conclusion: 研究为涌现通信与自然语言结构的比较提供了新视角，揭示了模拟约束对语言形态的影响。

Abstract: Emergent communication (EmCom) with deep neural network-based agents promises
to yield insights into the nature of human language, but remains focused
primarily on a few subfield-specific goals and metrics that prioritize
communication schemes which represent attributes with unique characters
one-to-one and compose them syntactically. We thus reinterpret a common EmCom
setting, the attribute-value reconstruction game, by imposing a
small-vocabulary constraint to simulate double articulation, and formulating a
novel setting analogous to naturalistic inflectional morphology (enabling
meaningful comparison to natural language communication schemes). We develop
new metrics and explore variations of this game motivated by real properties of
inflectional morphology: concatenativity and fusionality. Through our
experiments, we discover that simulated phonological constraints encourage
concatenative morphology, and emergent languages replicate the tendency of
natural languages to fuse grammatical attributes.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个评估LLMs情感认知推理能力的新方法，并公开了基准和代码，为未来研究提供了工具和方向。

Abstract: Affective Computing has been established as a crucial field of inquiry to
advance the holistic development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems.
Foundation models -- especially Large Language Models (LLMs) -- have been
evaluated, trained, or instruction-tuned in several past works, to become
better predictors or generators of emotion. Most of these studies, however,
approach emotion-related tasks in a supervised manner, assessing or training
the capabilities of LLMs using discrete emotion labels associated with stimuli
(e.g., text, images, video, audio). Evaluation studies, in particular, have
often been limited to standard and superficial emotion-related tasks, such as
the recognition of evoked or expressed emotions. In this paper, we move beyond
surface-level emotion tasks to investigate how LLMs reason about emotions
through cognitive dimensions. Drawing from cognitive appraisal theory, we
examine whether LLMs produce coherent and plausible cognitive reasoning when
reasoning about emotionally charged stimuli. We introduce a large-scale
benchmark on Cognitive Reasoning for Emotions - CoRE - to evaluate internal
cognitive structures implicitly used by LLMs for emotional reasoning. Through a
plethora of evaluation experiments and analysis, we seek to answer: (a) Are
models more likely to implicitly rely on specific cognitive appraisal
dimensions?, (b) What cognitive dimensions are important for characterizing
specific emotions?, and, (c) Can the internal representations of different
emotion categories in LLMs be interpreted through cognitive appraisal
dimensions? Our results and analyses reveal diverse reasoning patterns across
different LLMs. Our benchmark and code will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究难以单独评估检索对生成性能的贡献，且LLMs对提示敏感，需要一种轻量级、无监督的指标来衡量检索内容的相关性。

Method: 引入SPS指标，通过比较生成令牌与读者子空间主方向形成的面积来评估语义对齐；基于SPS提出xCompress框架，动态采样、排序和压缩检索摘要。

Result: 在五个QA基准测试和四种开源LLMs上的实验表明，SPS能提升任务性能，并为检索与生成的交互提供理论视角。

Conclusion: SPS和xCompress为RAG提供了有效的评估和优化工具，揭示了检索与生成之间的相互作用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown improved generation performance
through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) following the retriever-reader
paradigm, which supplements model inputs with externally retrieved knowledge.
However, prior work often evaluates RAG holistically, assessing the retriever
and reader jointly, making it difficult to isolate the true contribution of
retrieval, particularly given the prompt sensitivity of LLMs used as readers.
We introduce Spectrum Projection Score (SPS), a lightweight, supervision-free
metric that allows the reader to gauge the semantic alignment of a retrieved
summary with its hidden representation by comparing the area formed by
generated tokens from the summary, and the principal directions of subspace in
the reader and to measure the relevance. Building on SPS we present xCompress,
an inference time controller framework that dynamically samples, ranks, and
compresses retrieval summary candidates. Extensive experiments on five QA
benchmarks with four open source LLMs show that SPS not only enhances
performance across a range of tasks but also provides a principled perspective
on the interaction between retrieval and generation.

Motivation: 亲社会内容检测缺乏明确的定义和标注数据，需要新的方法来解决标注和部署问题。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1) 基于小规模人工标注数据选择最佳LLM标注策略；2) 通过人类与AI协作迭代优化任务定义；3) 使用GPT-4生成高质量标签并训练两阶段推理系统。

Result: 系统在保持高精度（约0.90）的同时，推理成本降低约70%。

Conclusion: 通过人类与AI协作、任务定义优化和部署感知设计，可扩展解决新型负责任AI任务。

Abstract: Detecting prosociality in text--communication intended to affirm, support, or
improve others' behavior--is a novel and increasingly important challenge for
trust and safety systems. Unlike toxic content detection, prosociality lacks
well-established definitions and labeled data, requiring new approaches to both
annotation and deployment. We present a practical, three-stage pipeline that
enables scalable, high-precision prosocial content classification while
minimizing human labeling effort and inference costs. First, we identify the
best LLM-based labeling strategy using a small seed set of human-labeled
examples. We then introduce a human-AI refinement loop, where annotators review
high-disagreement cases between GPT-4 and humans to iteratively clarify and
expand the task definition-a critical step for emerging annotation tasks like
prosociality. This process results in improved label quality and definition
alignment. Finally, we synthesize 10k high-quality labels using GPT-4 and train
a two-stage inference system: a lightweight classifier handles high-confidence
predictions, while only $\sim$35\% of ambiguous instances are escalated to
GPT-4o. This architecture reduces inference costs by $\sim$70% while achieving
high precision ($\sim$0.90). Our pipeline demonstrates how targeted human-AI
interaction, careful task formulation, and deployment-aware architecture design
can unlock scalable solutions for novel responsible AI tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注通过源和目标主题的分布对齐提取共享特征，但忽略了主题特定特征，限制了评估关键特质（如主题一致性）的能力。

Method: ATOP通过优化可学习的主题感知提示（包含共享和特定组件）来从预训练语言模型中提取相关知识，并引入对抗训练和邻居分类器增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在ASAP++数据集上的实验表明，ATOP在整体和多特质作文评分中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ATOP通过结合主题共享和特定特征，有效提升了跨主题AES的性能。

Abstract: Cross-topic automated essay scoring (AES) aims to develop a transferable
model capable of effectively evaluating essays on a target topic. A significant
challenge in this domain arises from the inherent discrepancies between topics.
While existing methods predominantly focus on extracting topic-shared features
through distribution alignment of source and target topics, they often neglect
topic-specific features, limiting their ability to assess critical traits such
as topic adherence. To address this limitation, we propose an Adversarial
TOpic-aware Prompt-tuning (ATOP), a novel method that jointly learns
topic-shared and topic-specific features to improve cross-topic AES. ATOP
achieves this by optimizing a learnable topic-aware prompt--comprising both
shared and specific components--to elicit relevant knowledge from pre-trained
language models (PLMs). To enhance the robustness of topic-shared prompt
learning and mitigate feature scale sensitivity introduced by topic alignment,
we incorporate adversarial training within a unified regression and
classification framework. In addition, we employ a neighbor-based classifier to
model the local structure of essay representations and generate pseudo-labels
for target-topic essays. These pseudo-labels are then used to guide the
supervised learning of topic-specific prompts tailored to the target topic.
Extensive experiments on the publicly available ASAP++ dataset demonstrate that
ATOP significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both
holistic and multi-trait essay scoring. The implementation of our method is
publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ATOP-A271.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自注意力机制二次计算成本高的问题，并挑战稀疏性必然导致准确性下降的普遍假设。

Method: 在SST-2情感分析任务中，对DistilBERT模型的注意力机制引入结构化、后验稀疏性进行微调。

Result: 80%注意力稀疏性的模型验证准确率达到91.59%，比密集基线提升0.97%。

Conclusion: 稀疏性可作为隐式正则化器，提升Transformer模型的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: The quadratic computational cost of the self-attention mechanism is a primary
challenge in scaling Transformer models. While attention sparsity is widely
studied as a technique to improve computational efficiency, it is almost
universally assumed to come at the cost of model accuracy. In this paper, we
report a surprising counter-example to this common wisdom. By introducing
structured, post-hoc sparsity to the attention mechanism of a DistilBERT model
during fine-tuning on the SST-2 sentiment analysis task, we find that model
accuracy improves significantly. Our model with 80\% attention sparsity
achieves a validation accuracy of 91.59\%, a 0.97\% absolute improvement over
the dense baseline. We hypothesize that this phenomenon is due to sparsity
acting as a powerful implicit regularizer, preventing the model from
overfitting by forcing it to make predictions with a more constrained and
robust set of features. Our work recasts attention sparsity not just as a tool
for computational efficiency, but as a potential method for improving the
generalization and performance of Transformer models.

Motivation: 现有自奖励语言模型在同步改进选择和拒绝响应时，逐渐缩小了对比样本之间的表示差异，削弱了偏好学习的有效性。

Method: 提出双阶段框架：(1) Anchored Rejection，固定拒绝响应；(2) Future-Guided Chosen，动态选择样本。

Result: 在多个模型家族和规模上实验显示，新方法显著优于基线，例如Llama3.1-8B在AlpacaEval 2.0上胜率提升9.75。

Conclusion: 新方法不仅提升了性能，还表现出优异的泛化能力，适用于数学推理、知识问答和代码生成等任务。

Abstract: Self-Rewarding Language Models propose an architecture in which the Large
Language Models(LLMs) both generates responses and evaluates its own outputs
via LLM-as-a-Judge prompting, dynamically improving its generative capabilities
through iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, our analysis
reveals a critical limitation in existing Self-Rewarding paradigms: the
synchronized improvement of chosen and rejected responses progressively narrows
the representational difference between contrasting samples, undermining
effective preference learning. We propose \textbf{Temporal Self-Rewarding
Language Models} that strategically coordinate past, present, and future model
generations to sustain learning signals. Our dual-phase framework introduces:
(1) \textit{Anchored Rejection} - fixing rejected responses using the past
initial model's outputs and (2) \textit{Future-Guided Chosen} - dynamically
curating chosen samples using next-generation model predictions. Extensive
experiments across three model families (Llama, Qwen, Mistral) and different
model sizes (Llama3B/8B/70B) demonstrate significant improvements when trained
with our method compared to Self-Rewarding using same computation resources.
For example, Llama3.1-8B reaches a 29.44 win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 with our
method, outperforming the Self-Rewarding baseline (19.69) by 9.75. Notably, our
method also demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization across
mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), knowledge-based QA (ARC, TruthfulQA), and code
generation (HumanEval) tasks, even though we do not specifically collect such
training data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM的随机性难以预测其知识获取情况，传统方法计算成本高，需要更高效的方法。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上验证，嵌入模型预测LLM知识的准确率高达90%。

Conclusion: PEEK方法可大规模识别LLM的知识缺口，并揭示其内部归纳偏好。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire knowledge across diverse domains such as
science, history, and geography encountered during generative pre-training.
However, due to their stochasticity, it is difficult to predict what LLMs have
acquired. Prior work has developed different ways to probe this knowledge by
investigating the hidden representations, crafting specific task prompts,
curating representative samples, and estimating their uncertainty. However,
these methods require making forward passes through the underlying model to
probe the LLM's knowledge about a specific fact, making them computationally
expensive and time-consuming. To bridge this gap, we propose $\textbf{PEEK}$ or
$\textbf{P}$roxy $\textbf{E}$mbeddings to $\textbf{E}$stimate
$\textbf{K}$nowledge of LLMs, by leveraging the pre-trained embedding models
that effectively encode factual knowledge as text or graphs as proxies for
LLMs. First, we identify a training set of facts known by LLMs through various
probing strategies and then adapt embedding models to predict the LLM outputs
with a linear decoder layer. Comprehensive evaluation on $3$ Wikipedia-derived
datasets, $4$ LLMs, and $7$ embedding models shows that embeddings can predict
LLM knowledge on a held-out set with up to 90 % accuracy. Furthermore, we find
that sentence embedding models are more suitable than graph embeddings to
predict LLM knowledge, shedding light on the underlying representation of the
factual landscape. Thus, we believe that knowledge-adapted embeddings can be
used to identify knowledge gaps in LLMs at scale and can provide deeper
insights into LLMs' internal inductive bias. The code and data are made
available at https://github.com/claws-lab/peek.

Motivation: 现有方法在开放任务（如故事评估）中表现有限，封闭模型适应性差，开源模型缺乏严谨推理能力，亟需改进。

Method: 提出EvolvR框架，通过多角色策略自合成评分对齐的思维链数据，并利用多智能体自过滤确保数据质量，最终训练评估器作为奖励模型。

Result: 在StoryER、HANNA和OpenMEVA三个基准测试中达到SOTA性能，并显著提升生成故事的质量。

Conclusion: EvolvR框架通过自演化方法有效解决了故事评估中的局限性，验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Although the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges
(LLM-as-a-judge) has been validated, their performance remains limited in
open-ended tasks, particularly in story evaluation. Accurate story evaluation
is crucial not only for assisting human quality judgment but also for providing
key signals to guide story generation. However, existing methods face a
dilemma: prompt engineering for closed-source models suffers from poor
adaptability, while fine-tuning approaches for open-source models lack the
rigorous reasoning capabilities essential for story evaluation. To address
this, we propose the Self-Evolving Pairwise Reasoning (EvolvR) framework.
Grounded in pairwise comparison, the framework first self-synthesizes
score-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data via a multi-persona strategy. To
ensure data quality, these raw CoTs undergo a self-filtering process, utilizing
multi-agents to guarantee their logical rigor and robustness. Finally, the
evaluator trained on the refined data is deployed as a reward model to guide
the story generation task. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on three evaluation benchmarks
including StoryER, HANNA and OpenMEVA. Furthermore, when served as a reward
model, it significantly enhances the quality of generated stories, thereby
fully validating the superiority of our self-evolving approach.

images, and beyond. In this work, we leverage modern LLMs as computational
creativity aids for end-to-end conlang creation. We introduce ConlangCrafter, a
multi-hop pipeline that decomposes language design into modular stages --
phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon generation, and translation. At each
stage, our method leverages LLMs' meta-linguistic reasoning capabilities,
injecting randomness to encourage diversity and leveraging self-refinement
feedback to encourage consistency in the emerging language description. We
evaluate ConlangCrafter on metrics measuring coherence and typological
diversity, demonstrating its ability to produce coherent and varied conlangs
without human linguistic expertise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决《古兰经》文本中复杂语言、独特术语和深层含义带来的问答挑战。

Method: 1. 使用少样本提示和指令调优的大型语言模型（如Gemini和DeepSeek）；2. 开发专用阿拉伯语提示框架；3. 引入后处理系统（子词对齐、重叠抑制和语义过滤）。

Result: 基于阿拉伯语指令的大型语言模型优于传统微调模型，最佳配置的pAP10得分为0.637。

Conclusion: 基于提示的指令调优对低资源、语义丰富的问答任务有效。

Abstract: This paper presents two effective approaches for Extractive Question
Answering (QA) on the Quran. It addresses challenges related to complex
language, unique terminology, and deep meaning in the text. The second uses
few-shot prompting with instruction-tuned large language models such as Gemini
and DeepSeek. A specialized Arabic prompt framework is developed for span
extraction. A strong post-processing system integrates subword alignment,
overlap suppression, and semantic filtering. This improves precision and
reduces hallucinations. Evaluations show that large language models with Arabic
instructions outperform traditional fine-tuned models. The best configuration
achieves a pAP10 score of 0.637. The results confirm that prompt-based
instruction tuning is effective for low-resource, semantically rich QA tasks.

TL;DR: LogicRAG框架通过动态构建逻辑依赖图，优化检索增强生成（RAG）的性能和效率，解决了传统GraphRAG的高成本和结构不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在处理超出其知识范围的问题时容易产生幻觉，现有基于图的RAG方法成本高且结构固定，无法适应多样化查询需求。

Method: 提出LogicRAG框架，动态分解查询为子问题并构建有向无环图（DAG），通过拓扑排序和多步推理优化检索，同时应用图剪枝和上下文剪枝降低开销。

Result: 实验表明LogicRAG在性能和效率上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: LogicRAG通过动态逻辑结构提取和自适应检索，显著提升了RAG的实用性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination, generating
factually incorrect statements when handling questions beyond their knowledge
and perception. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by
retrieving query-relevant contexts from knowledge bases to support LLM
reasoning. Recent advances leverage pre-constructed graphs to capture the
relational connections among distributed documents, showing remarkable
performance in complex tasks. However, existing Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG)
methods rely on a costly process to transform the corpus into a graph,
introducing overwhelming token cost and update latency. Moreover, real-world
queries vary in type and complexity, requiring different logic structures for
accurate reasoning. The pre-built graph may not align with these required
structures, resulting in ineffective knowledge retrieval. To this end, we
propose a \textbf{\underline{Logic}}-aware
\textbf{\underline{R}}etrieval-\textbf{\underline{A}}ugmented
\textbf{\underline{G}}eneration framework (\textbf{LogicRAG}) that dynamically
extracts reasoning structures at inference time to guide adaptive retrieval
without any pre-built graph. LogicRAG begins by decomposing the input query
into a set of subproblems and constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to
model the logical dependencies among them. To support coherent multi-step
reasoning, LogicRAG then linearizes the graph using topological sort, so that
subproblems can be addressed in a logically consistent order. Besides, LogicRAG
applies graph pruning to reduce redundant retrieval and uses context pruning to
filter irrelevant context, significantly reducing the overall token cost.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogicRAG achieves both superior
performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出AURA框架，通过过程奖励模型（PRMs）多层级评估逻辑一致性和安全性，显著提升模型输出的安全性和逻辑完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在安全性方面存在逻辑隐含风险的挑战，传统方法缺乏细粒度和主动性。

Method: 引入AURA框架，结合自省式自我批评、细粒度PRM评估和自适应安全感知解码。

Result: 实验证明AURA显著优于现有方法，提升模型输出的逻辑完整性和安全性。

Conclusion: AURA为更安全、负责任和上下文感知的AI设立了新基准。

Abstract: Present day LLMs face the challenge of managing affordance-based safety
risks-situations where outputs inadvertently facilitate harmful actions due to
overlooked logical implications. Traditional safety solutions, such as scalar
outcome-based reward models, parameter tuning, or heuristic decoding
strategies, lack the granularity and proactive nature needed to reliably detect
and intervene during subtle yet crucial reasoning steps. Addressing this
fundamental gap, we introduce AURA, an innovative, multi-layered framework
centered around Process Reward Models (PRMs), providing comprehensive, step
level evaluations across logical coherence and safety-awareness. Our framework
seamlessly combines introspective self-critique, fine-grained PRM assessments,
and adaptive safety-aware decoding to dynamically and proactively guide models
toward safer reasoning trajectories. Empirical evidence clearly demonstrates
that this approach significantly surpasses existing methods, significantly
improving the logical integrity and affordance-sensitive safety of model
outputs. This research represents a pivotal step toward safer, more
responsible, and contextually aware AI, setting a new benchmark for
alignment-sensitive applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为选择性反射蒸馏（SRD）的新框架，通过动态评估和选择高质量、学生模型兼容的训练数据，提升知识蒸馏（KD）效果，并减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有白盒KD方法忽视了训练数据质量和学生模型兼容性，限制了蒸馏效果。

Method: SRD利用学生模型的反馈动态筛选数据，并通过课程调度策略逐步引入数据。

Result: 实验表明SRD能提升蒸馏模型性能，并减少高达39%的训练时间。

Conclusion: 数据质量和兼容性对KD至关重要，SRD提供了一种无需修改底层算法的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a fundamental technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) into compact, efficient student models. However,
existing white-box KD methods mainly focus on balancing ground truth and
student-generated responses while overlooking two critical factors: training
data quality and student-model compatibility. To address these limitations, we
propose Selective Reflection Distillation (SRD), a novel data curation
framework that leverages reflections from student models to systematically
refine training data. SRD dynamically evaluates and selects prompt-response
pairs by comparing ground truth data with student model outputs, selectively
curating high-quality, student-compatible training instances through automated
ranking based on difficulty. Furthermore, after selecting the training data, a
curriculum scheduling strategy is employed to incrementally introduce these
curated subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals. As a
plug-and-play enhancement, SRD consistently improves distillation outcomes
across diverse white-box KD approaches and model architectures, as well as
decreases computational cost significantly during KD training. Experiments on a
range of language model benchmarks demonstrate SRD's consistent improvements in
distilled model performance, as well as a reduction in training runtime by up
to 39%, under diverse KD methods and model families. Notably, SRD operates as a
plug-and-play module, enhancing sample efficiency without modifying underlying
KD algorithms. Our findings highlight that data quality and compatibility are
pivotal to effective and efficient distillation of LLMs, and SRD provides a
principled framework to achieve both. This work advances the understanding of
data-centric factors in KD and offers practical insights for enhancing the
capability and efficiency of compressed LLMs.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型生成过程中可能出现的隐性刻板印象问题，揭示模型输出中的隐藏社会偏见。

Method: 结合嵌套语义表示与上下文对比机制，提取潜在偏见特征，并通过注意力权重扰动分析模型敏感性。

Result: 在多个刻板印象维度（如性别、职业、宗教和种族）上表现出强大的检测性能，能准确识别语义相似文本间的偏见差异。

Conclusion: 该方法具有高解释性和实用性，为偏见检测提供了透明可靠的技术基础，适用于需要高可信生成内容的应用场景。

Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of implicit stereotypes that may arise during
the generation process of large language models. It proposes an interpretable
bias detection method aimed at identifying hidden social biases in model
outputs, especially those semantic tendencies that are not easily captured
through explicit linguistic features. The method combines nested semantic
representation with a contextual contrast mechanism. It extracts latent bias
features from the vector space structure of model outputs. Using attention
weight perturbation, it analyzes the model's sensitivity to specific social
attribute terms, thereby revealing the semantic pathways through which bias is
formed. To validate the effectiveness of the method, this study uses the
StereoSet dataset, which covers multiple stereotype dimensions including
gender, profession, religion, and race. The evaluation focuses on several key
metrics, such as bias detection accuracy, semantic consistency, and contextual
sensitivity. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves strong
detection performance across various dimensions. It can accurately identify
bias differences between semantically similar texts while maintaining high
semantic alignment and output stability. The method also demonstrates high
interpretability in its structural design. It helps uncover the internal bias
association mechanisms within language models. This provides a more transparent
and reliable technical foundation for bias detection. The approach is suitable
for real-world applications where high trustworthiness of generated content is
required.

TL;DR: TADrop是一种自适应稀疏化策略，通过为每个参数张量分配定制化的稀疏度，优化模型合并性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法采用统一的稀疏化比例，忽略了参数的结构和统计异质性，导致关键参数被误删或冗余参数被保留。

Method: TADrop根据参数张量的分布特性动态调整稀疏度，密度高的张量被更激进地剪枝，稀疏且关键的张量被保留。

Result: 实验表明，TADrop显著提升了多种任务（视觉、语言、多模态）和模型（ViT、BEiT）的性能，平均提升2.0%。

Conclusion: TADrop通过自适应稀疏化有效减少参数干扰，为高性能模型合并提供了新基准。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a compelling data-free paradigm for multi-task
learning, enabling the fusion of multiple fine-tuned models into a single,
powerful entity. A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which
prunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference.
However, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy,
applying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and
statistical heterogeneity of model parameters. This often leads to a suboptimal
trade-off, where critical parameters are inadvertently pruned while less useful
ones are retained. To address this limitation, we introduce \textbf{TADrop}
(\textbf{T}ensor-wise \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{Drop}), an adaptive
sparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global
ratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based
on its distributional properties. The core intuition is that tensors with
denser, more redundant distributions can be pruned aggressively, while sparser,
more critical ones are preserved. As a simple and plug-and-play module, we
validate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging
methods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and
multimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and
significantly boosts their performance. For instance, when enhancing a leading
merging method, it achieves an average performance gain of 2.0\% across 8
ViT-B/32 tasks. TADrop provides a more effective way to mitigate parameter
interference by tailoring sparsification to the model's structure, offering a
new baseline for high-performance model merging.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中检索增强生成（RAG）和基于可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）通常孤立发展，限制了泛化能力和应用范围。

Method: 提出UR2框架，包含难度感知的课程训练和混合知识访问策略，动态协调检索与推理。

Result: 在多个任务中，UR2显著优于现有RAG和RL方法，性能接近GPT-4o-mini和GPT-4.1-mini。

Conclusion: UR2通过统一检索与推理，提升了模型的适应性和性能，为多任务应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities through two
complementary paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances
knowledge grounding, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR),
which optimizes complex reasoning abilities. However, these two capabilities
are often developed in isolation, and existing efforts to unify them remain
narrow in scope-typically limited to open-domain QA with fixed retrieval
settings and task-specific assumptions. This lack of integration constrains
generalization and limits the applicability of RAG-RL methods to broader
domains. To bridge this gap, we propose UR2 (Unified RAG and Reasoning), a
general framework that unifies retrieval and reasoning through reinforcement
learning. UR2 introduces two key contributions: a difficulty-aware curriculum
training that selectively invokes retrieval only for challenging problems, and
a hybrid knowledge access strategy combining domain-specific offline corpora
with LLM-generated summaries. These components are designed to enable dynamic
coordination between retrieval and reasoning, improving adaptability across a
diverse range of tasks. Experiments across open-domain QA, MMLU-Pro, medical,
and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that UR2 (built on Qwen2.5-3/7B
and LLaMA-3.1-8B) significantly outperforms existing RAG and RL methods,
achieving comparable performance to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several
benchmarks. We have released all code, models, and data at

Motivation: 传统语用学理论基于人类中心假设，不适用于LLMs等预测系统，需重新思考语用学在AI通信中的角色。

Method: 1. 挑战传统符号学三分法，提出HMC框架；2. 分析人类中心与机器中心语用学的冲突，引入概率语用学；3. 讨论替代主义问题及语境挫折现象。

Result: 传统语用学需调整以适配生成式AI，概率语用学更适用，同时需避免人类中心偏见。

Conclusion: 语用学理论需扩展以涵盖人机通信，强调优化而非真值评估，并关注语境构建的动态性。

Abstract: The paper reconceptualizes pragmatics not as a subordinate, third dimension
of meaning, but as a dynamic interface through which language operates as a
socially embedded tool for action. With the emergence of large language models
(LLMs) in communicative contexts, this understanding needs to be further
refined and methodologically reconsidered. The first section challenges the
traditional semiotic trichotomy, arguing that connectionist LLM architectures
destabilize established hierarchies of meaning, and proposes the Human-Machine
Communication (HMC) framework as a more suitable alternative. The second
section examines the tension between human-centred pragmatic theories and the
machine-centred nature of LLMs. While traditional, Gricean-inspired pragmatics
continue to dominate, it relies on human-specific assumptions ill-suited to
predictive systems like LLMs. Probabilistic pragmatics, particularly the
Rational Speech Act framework, offers a more compatible teleology by focusing
on optimization rather than truth-evaluation. The third section addresses the
issue of substitutionalism in three forms - generalizing, linguistic, and
communicative - highlighting the anthropomorphic biases that distort LLM
evaluation and obscure the role of human communicative subjects. Finally, the
paper introduces the concept of context frustration to describe the paradox of
increased contextual input paired with a collapse in contextual understanding,
emphasizing how users are compelled to co-construct pragmatic conditions both
for the model and themselves. These arguments suggest that pragmatic theory may
need to be adjusted or expanded to better account for communication involving
generative AI.

Conclusion: 研究为有限数据下高效知识注入提供了路径，并揭示了学习新内容与保留现有能力之间的平衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often require vast amounts of text to
effectively acquire new knowledge. While continuing pre-training on large
corpora or employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven
successful, updating an LLM with only a few thousand or million tokens remains
challenging. In this work, we investigate the task of injecting small,
unstructured information into LLMs and its relation to the catastrophic
forgetting phenomenon. We use a dataset of recent news -- ensuring no overlap
with the model's pre-training data -- to evaluate the knowledge acquisition by
probing the model with question-answer pairs related the learned information.
Starting from a continued pre-training baseline, we explored different
augmentation algorithms to generate synthetic data to improve the knowledge
acquisition capabilities. Our experiments show that simply continuing
pre-training on limited data yields modest improvements, whereas exposing the
model to diverse textual variations significantly improves the learning of new
facts -- particularly with methods that induce greater variability through
diverse prompting. Furthermore, we shed light on the forgetting phenomenon in
small-data regimes, illustrating the delicate balance between learning new
content and retaining existing capabilities. We also confirm the sensitivity of
RAG-based approaches for knowledge injection, which often lead to greater
degradation on control datasets compared to parametric methods. Finally, we
demonstrate that models can generate effective synthetic training data
themselves, suggesting a pathway toward self-improving model updates. All code
and generated data used in our experiments are publicly available, providing a

Method: 采用动态知识图谱（DKG）和Grok 3 LLM，结合自适应语义融合算法（ASFA），整合异构医疗数据（如临床报告和PubMed文章），动态生成和更新知识图谱。

Result: DKG-LLM在MIMIC-III和PubMed数据集上表现优异：诊断准确率84.19%，治疗推荐准确率89.63%，语义覆盖率93.48%。

Conclusion: DKG-LLM是一种可靠且具有变革性的工具，能够处理噪声数据和复杂多症状疾病，并通过医生反馈持续学习。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown exponentially since the release of
ChatGPT. These models have gained attention due to their robust performance on
various tasks, including language processing tasks. These models achieve
understanding and comprehension of tasks by training billions of parameters.
The development of these models is a transformative force in enhancing natural
language understanding and has taken a significant step towards artificial
general intelligence (AGI). In this study, we aim to present the DKG-LLM
framework. The DKG-LLM framework introduces a groundbreaking approach to
medical diagnosis and personalized treatment recommendations by integrating a
dynamic knowledge graph (DKG) with the Grok 3 large language model. Using the
Adaptive Semantic Fusion Algorithm (ASFA), heterogeneous medical data
(including clinical reports and PubMed articles) and patient records
dynamically generate a knowledge graph consisting of 15,964 nodes in 13
distinct types (e.g., diseases, symptoms, treatments, patient profiles) and
127,392 edges in 26 relationship types (e.g., causal, therapeutic,
association). ASFA utilizes advanced probabilistic models, Bayesian inference,
and graph optimization to extract semantic information, dynamically updating
the graph with approximately 150 new nodes and edges in each data category
while maintaining scalability with up to 987,654 edges. Real-world datasets,
including MIMIC-III and PubMed, were utilized to evaluate the proposed
architecture. The evaluation results show that DKG-LLM achieves a diagnostic
accuracy of 84.19%. The model also has a treatment recommendation accuracy of
89.63% and a semantic coverage of 93.48%. DKG-LLM is a reliable and
transformative tool that handles noisy data and complex multi-symptom diseases,
along with feedback-based learning from physician input.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法（如二元分类或多维度框架）无法量化危害强度或适应不同场景，导致评估精度不足。

Method: 提出SceneJailEval框架，包含场景自适应多维度评估方法和14个场景的数据集。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得最佳性能（F1分数0.917和0.995），超越现有方法。

Conclusion: SceneJailEval通过场景自适应框架和高质量数据集，显著提升了越狱评估的精确性和适应性。

Abstract: Precise jailbreak evaluation is vital for LLM red teaming and jailbreak
research. Current approaches employ binary classification ( e.g., string
matching, toxic text classifiers, LLM-driven methods), yielding only "yes/no"
labels without quantifying harm intensity. Existing multi-dimensional
frameworks ( e.g., Security Violation, Relative Truthfulness, Informativeness)
apply uniform evaluation criteria across scenarios, resulting in
scenario-specific mismatches--for instance, "Relative Truthfulness" is
irrelevant to "hate speech"--which compromise evaluation precision. To tackle
these limitations, we introduce SceneJailEval, with key contributions: (1) A
groundbreaking scenario-adaptive multi-dimensional framework for jailbreak
evaluation, overcoming the critical "one-size-fits-all" constraint of existing
multi-dimensional methods, and featuring strong extensibility to flexibly adapt
to customized or emerging scenarios. (2) A comprehensive 14-scenario dataset
with diverse jailbreak variants and regional cases, filling the long-standing
gap in high-quality, holistic benchmarks for scenario-adaptive evaluation. (3)
SceneJailEval achieves state-of-the-art results, with an F1 score of 0.917 on
our full-scenario dataset (+6% over prior SOTA) and 0.995 on JBB (+3% over
prior SOTA), surpassing accuracy limits of existing evaluation methods in
heterogeneous scenarios and confirming its advantage.

Method: 提出四层EI分类法，设计EICAP-Bench评测基准，对六种LLM进行评估，并通过LoRA适配器在UltraChat数据集上微调模型。

Result: Qwen2.5-Instruct表现最佳，但仅Appraisal层通过微调显著提升，其他层未见明显改进。

Conclusion: 现有方法难以全面提升LLM的情感推理能力，需针对性数据和建模策略。

Abstract: Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a critical yet underexplored dimension in the
development of human-aligned LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce a unified,
psychologically grounded four-layer taxonomy of EI tailored for large language
models (LLMs), encompassing emotional tracking, cause inference, appraisal, and
emotionally appropriate response generation. Building on this framework, we
present EICAP-Bench, a novel MCQ style multi-turn benchmark designed to
evaluate EI capabilities in open-source LLMs across diverse linguistic and
cultural contexts. We evaluate six LLMs: LLaMA3 (8B), LLaMA3-Instruct, Gemma
(9B), Gemma-Instruct, Qwen2.5 (7B), and Qwen2.5-Instruct on EmoCap-Bench,
identifying Qwen2.5-Instruct as the strongest baseline. To assess the potential
for enhancing EI capabilities, we fine-tune both Qwen2.5-Base and
Qwen2.5-Instruct using LoRA adapters on UltraChat (UC), a large-scale,
instruction-tuned dialogue dataset, in both English and Arabic. Our statistical
analysis reveals that among the five EI layers, only the Appraisal layer shows
significant improvement through UC-based fine-tuning. These findings highlight
the limitations of existing pretraining and instruction-tuning paradigms in
equipping LLMs with deeper emotional reasoning and underscore the need for
targeted data and modeling strategies for comprehensive EI alignment.

adapt to evolving policies without costly retraining. We present classification
using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shifts traditional
classification tasks from determining the correct category in accordance with
pre-trained parameters to evaluating content in relation to contextual
knowledge retrieved at inference. In hate speech detection, this transforms the
task from "is this hate speech?" to "does this violate the hate speech policy?"
  Our Contextual Policy Engine (CPE) - an agentic RAG system - demonstrates
this approach and offers three key advantages: (1) robust classification
accuracy comparable to leading commercial systems, (2) inherent explainability
via retrieved policy segments, and (3) dynamic policy updates without model
retraining. Through three experiments, we demonstrate strong baseline
performance and show that the system can apply fine-grained policy control by
correctly adjusting protection for specific identity groups without requiring
retraining or compromising overall performance. These findings establish that
RAG can transform classification into a more flexible, transparent, and
adaptable process for content moderation and wider classification problems.

### [129] [InfoCausalQA:Can Models Perform Non-explicit Causal Reasoning Based on Infographic?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06220)
*Keummin Ka,Junhyeong Park,Jahyun Jeon,Youngjae Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfoCausalQA是一个新的基准测试，用于评估基于信息图表的多模态因果推理能力，发现当前视觉语言模型在计算和语义因果推理上表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在因果推理方面的能力，填补多模态环境下因果推理研究的空白。

Method: 构建InfoCausalQA基准，包含定量和语义因果推理任务，使用GPT-4生成问题并由人工修订。

Result: 当前视觉语言模型在计算和语义因果推理上表现较差，与人类能力差距显著。

Conclusion: 需要提升多模态AI系统的因果推理能力，InfoCausalQA为此提供了评估工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in perception and reasoning. However, the ability to perform
causal inference -- a core aspect of human cognition -- remains underexplored,
particularly in multimodal settings. In this study, we introduce InfoCausalQA,
a novel benchmark designed to evaluate causal reasoning grounded in
infographics that combine structured visual data with textual context. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: Task 1 focuses on quantitative causal reasoning
based on inferred numerical trends, while Task 2 targets semantic causal
reasoning involving five types of causal relations: cause, effect,
intervention, counterfactual, and temporal. We manually collected 494
infographic-text pairs from four public sources and used GPT-4o to generate
1,482 high-quality multiple-choice QA pairs. These questions were then
carefully revised by humans to ensure they cannot be answered based on
surface-level cues alone but instead require genuine visual grounding. Our
experimental results reveal that current VLMs exhibit limited capability in
computational reasoning and even more pronounced limitations in semantic causal
reasoning. Their significantly lower performance compared to humans indicates a
substantial gap in leveraging infographic-based information for causal
inference. Through InfoCausalQA, we highlight the need for advancing the causal
reasoning abilities of multimodal AI systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合Whisper ASR和Transformer语言模型的方法，用于德语老年人的语音意图识别，利用LLM生成合成数据提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有意图识别方法局限于短命令和英语的问题，专注于德语老年人的语音识别需求。

Method: 结合Whisper ASR模型和Transformer语言模型，利用LLM（LeoLM、Llama3、ChatGPT）生成合成数据，并通过TTS模型生成语音进行测试。

Result: 合成数据显著提升分类性能和鲁棒性，LeoLM在德语意图识别中表现优于ChatGPT。

Conclusion: 生成式AI可有效填补低资源领域的数据缺口，方法透明且可复现。

Abstract: Intent recognition (IR) for speech commands is essential for artificial
intelligence (AI) assistant systems; however, most existing approaches are
limited to short commands and are predominantly developed for English. This
paper addresses these limitations by focusing on IR from speech by elderly
German speakers. We propose a novel approach that combines an adapted Whisper
ASR model, fine-tuned on elderly German speech (SVC-de), with Transformer-based
language models trained on synthetic text datasets generated by three
well-known large language models (LLMs): LeoLM, Llama3, and ChatGPT. To
evaluate the robustness of our approach, we generate synthetic speech with a
text-to-speech model and conduct extensive cross-dataset testing. Our results
show that synthetic LLM-generated data significantly boosts classification
performance and robustness to different speaking styles and unseen vocabulary.
Notably, we find that LeoLM, a smaller, domain-specific 13B LLM, surpasses the
much larger ChatGPT (175B) in dataset quality for German intent recognition.
Our approach demonstrates that generative AI can effectively bridge data gaps
in low-resource domains. We provide detailed documentation of our data
generation and training process to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

*Ruichong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MDIR的新方法，用于检测大型语言模型（LLM）的抄袭行为，解决了现有方法在权重对应重建、统计显著性计算和误报方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，大型语言模型的知识产权问题日益突出，现有抄袭检测方法存在权重对应重建不准确、缺乏统计显著性计算等问题，亟需改进。

Method: MDIR利用矩阵分析和大偏差理论，专注于权重相似性，无需完整模型推理，实现了权重关系的准确重建和严格的p值估计。

Result: 实验表明，MDIR即使在随机排列和持续预训练等复杂变换后，仍能可靠检测抄袭，且单台PC一小时内即可完成检测。

Conclusion: MDIR是一种高效、准确的LLM抄袭检测方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, concerns about intellectual property (IP) in large language
models (LLMs) have grown significantly. Plagiarizing other LLMs (through direct
weight copying, upcycling, pruning, or continual pretraining) and claiming
authorship without properly attributing to the original license, is a serious
misconduct that can lead to significant financial and reputational harm to the
original developers. However, existing methods for detecting LLM plagiarism
fall short in key areas. They fail to accurately reconstruct weight
correspondences, lack the ability to compute statistical significance measures
such as $p$-values, and may mistakenly flag models trained on similar data as
being related. To address these limitations, we propose Matrix-Driven Instant
Review (MDIR), a novel method that leverages matrix analysis and Large
Deviation Theory. MDIR achieves accurate reconstruction of weight
relationships, provides rigorous $p$-value estimation, and focuses exclusively
on weight similarity without requiring full model inference. Experimental
results demonstrate that MDIR reliably detects plagiarism even after extensive
transformations, such as random permutations and continual pretraining with
trillions of tokens. Moreover, all detections can be performed on a single PC
within an hour, making MDIR both efficient and accessible.

Motivation: 网络欺凌检测因表达方式多样且隐蔽而具有挑战性，研究旨在通过辅助任务提升模型性能。

Method: 采用指令调优的大型语言模型，评估零样本、少样本、独立LoRA微调和多任务学习策略，并提出基于攻击性预测的提示增强方法。

Result: 提示增强方法在实验中表现优于标准LoRA微调，攻击性信息显著提升检测效果。

Conclusion: 辅助任务（如攻击性检测）可提升大型语言模型在安全关键应用中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Detecting cyberbullying on social media remains a critical challenge due to
its subtle and varied expressions. This study investigates whether integrating
aggression detection as an auxiliary task within a unified training framework
can enhance the generalisation and performance of large language models (LLMs)
in cyberbullying detection. Experiments are conducted on five aggression
datasets and one cyberbullying dataset using instruction-tuned LLMs. We
evaluated multiple strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, independent LoRA
fine-tuning, and multi-task learning (MTL). Given the inconsistent results of
MTL, we propose an enriched prompt pipeline approach in which aggression
predictions are embedded into cyberbullying detection prompts to provide
contextual augmentation. Preliminary results show that the enriched prompt
pipeline consistently outperforms standard LoRA fine-tuning, indicating that
aggression-informed context significantly boosts cyberbullying detection. This
study highlights the potential of auxiliary tasks, such as aggression
detection, to improve the generalisation of LLMs for safety-critical
applications on social networks.

TL;DR: 论文提出ChatAnime数据集，结合角色扮演和情感支持能力，评估LLMs在动漫角色情感支持对话中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未结合LLMs的角色扮演和情感支持能力，研究填补这一空白，以动漫角色为案例。

Method: 选择20个动漫角色和40名爱好者，收集对话数据，设计9个细粒度指标评估LLMs表现。

Result: 表现最佳的LLMs在角色扮演和情感支持上超越人类，但人类在回答多样性上仍占优。

Conclusion: ChatAnime为优化LLMs在情感支持角色扮演中的研究提供了资源和见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
role-playing conversations and providing emotional support as separate research
directions. However, there remains a significant research gap in combining
these capabilities to enable emotionally supportive interactions with virtual
characters. To address this research gap, we focus on anime characters as a
case study because of their well-defined personalities and large fan bases.
This choice enables us to effectively evaluate how well LLMs can provide
emotional support while maintaining specific character traits. We introduce
ChatAnime, the first Emotionally Supportive Role-Playing (ESRP) dataset. We
first thoughtfully select 20 top-tier characters from popular anime communities
and design 60 emotion-centric real-world scenario questions. Then, we execute a
nationwide selection process to identify 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts with
profound knowledge of specific characters and extensive experience in
role-playing. Next, we systematically collect two rounds of dialogue data from
10 LLMs and these 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts. To evaluate the ESRP
performance of LLMs, we design a user experience-oriented evaluation system
featuring 9 fine-grained metrics across three dimensions: basic dialogue,
role-playing and emotional support, along with an overall metric for response
diversity. In total, the dataset comprises 2,400 human-written and 24,000
LLM-generated answers, supported by over 132,000 human annotations.
Experimental results show that top-performing LLMs surpass human fans in
role-playing and emotional support, while humans still lead in response
diversity. We hope this work can provide valuable resources and insights for
future research on optimizing LLMs in ESRP. Our datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCP在动态聚合实时数据时存在安全和隐私风险，现有防御方法不足。

Method: SecMCP通过建模LLM激活向量在潜在多面体空间中，识别对话动态的异常变化。

Result: 在多个LLM和数据集上验证，AUROC得分超过0.915，同时保持系统可用性。

Conclusion: SecMCP有效解决了MCP的安全威胁，并提供了新的量化方法。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external tools, enabling dynamic aggregation of real-time data to
improve task execution. However, its non-isolated execution context introduces
critical security and privacy risks. In particular, adversarially crafted
content can induce tool poisoning or indirect prompt injection, leading to
conversation hijacking, misinformation propagation, or data exfiltration.
Existing defenses, such as rule-based filters or LLM-driven detection, remain
inadequate due to their reliance on static signatures, computational
inefficiency, and inability to quantify conversational hijacking. To address
these limitations, we propose SecMCP, a secure framework that detects and
quantifies conversation drift, deviations in latent space trajectories induced
by adversarial external knowledge. By modeling LLM activation vectors within a
latent polytope space, SecMCP identifies anomalous shifts in conversational
dynamics, enabling proactive detection of hijacking, misleading, and data
exfiltration. We evaluate SecMCP on three state-of-the-art LLMs (Llama3,
Vicuna, Mistral) across benchmark datasets (MS MARCO, HotpotQA, FinQA),
demonstrating robust detection with AUROC scores exceeding 0.915 while
maintaining system usability. Our contributions include a systematic
categorization of MCP security threats, a novel latent polytope-based
methodology for quantifying conversation drift, and empirical validation of
SecMCP's efficacy.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型代理程序记忆脆弱、依赖手动设计或静态参数的问题。

Method: 提出Memp方法，将代理轨迹提炼为细粒度指令和高级脚本抽象，并研究构建、检索和更新策略。

Result: 实验显示，随着记忆库优化，代理在类似任务中的成功率和效率持续提升；强模型构建的程序记忆迁移至弱模型也能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: Memp方法通过动态更新程序记忆，显著提升代理任务表现，且记忆可迁移性强。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents excel at diverse tasks, yet they
suffer from brittle procedural memory that is manually engineered or entangled
in static parameters. In this work, we investigate strategies to endow agents
with a learnable, updatable, and lifelong procedural memory. We propose Memp
that distills past agent trajectories into both fine-grained, step-by-step
instructions and higher-level, script-like abstractions, and explore the impact
of different strategies for Build, Retrieval, and Update of procedural memory.
Coupled with a dynamic regimen that continuously updates, corrects, and
deprecates its contents, this repository evolves in lockstep with new
experience. Empirical evaluation on TravelPlanner and ALFWorld shows that as
the memory repository is refined, agents achieve steadily higher success rates
and greater efficiency on analogous tasks. Moreover, procedural memory built
from a stronger model retains its value: migrating the procedural memory to a
weaker model yields substantial performance gains.

Conclusion: 跨语言能力无需大量多语言训练，轻量级干预可修正偏见，开源模型高效且低成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming social-science research by
enabling scalable, precise analysis. Their adaptability raises the question of
whether knowledge acquired through fine-tuning in a few languages can transfer
to unseen languages that only appeared during pre-training. To examine this, we
fine-tune lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B models on monolingual, bilingual, or
multilingual data sets to classify immigration-related tweets from X/Twitter
across 13 languages, a domain characterised by polarised, culturally specific
discourse. We evaluate whether minimal language-specific fine-tuning enables
cross-lingual topic detection and whether adding targeted languages corrects
pre-training biases. Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages
can reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages. However,
identifying whether a tweet expresses a pro- or anti-immigration stance
benefits from multilingual fine-tuning. Pre-training bias favours dominant
languages, but even minimal exposure to under-represented languages during
fine-tuning (as little as $9.62\times10^{-11}$ of the original pre-training
token volume) yields significant gains. These findings challenge the assumption
that cross-lingual mastery requires extensive multilingual training: limited
language coverage suffices for topic-level generalisation, and structural
biases can be corrected with lightweight interventions. By releasing
4-bit-quantised, LoRA fine-tuned models, we provide an open-source,
reproducible alternative to proprietary LLMs that delivers 35 times faster
inference at just 0.00000989% of the dollar cost of the OpenAI GPT-4o model,
enabling scalable, inclusive research.

Abstract: The rapid rise of Generative AI (GenAI), particularly LLMs, poses concerns
for journalistic integrity and authorship. This study examines AI-generated
content across over 40,000 news articles from major, local, and college news
media, in various media formats. Using three advanced AI-text detectors (e.g.,
Binoculars, Fast-Detect GPT, and GPTZero), we find substantial increase of
GenAI use in recent years, especially in local and college news. Sentence-level
analysis reveals LLMs are often used in the introduction of news, while
conclusions usually written manually. Linguistic analysis shows GenAI boosts
word richness and readability but lowers formality, leading to more uniform
writing styles, particularly in local media.

Result: 实验显示TTFT加速2.53倍，端到端延迟降低1.88倍，性能无损。

Conclusion: SlimInfer高效加速LLM推理，适用于长上下文任务。

Abstract: Long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily limited by
high computational demands. While several existing methods optimize attention
computation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer,
limiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative
framework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical
prompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information
diffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through
layers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion
process suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive
tokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states.
Motivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning
mechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at
intermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous
KV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex
predictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs. Extensive experiments
show that SlimInfer can achieve up to $\mathbf{2.53\times}$ time-to-first-token
(TTFT) speedup and $\mathbf{1.88\times}$ end-to-end latency reduction for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on a single RTX 4090, without sacrificing performance on
LongBench. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 触觉信号在多模态研究中较少被探索，而其在虚拟现实、无障碍和康复应用中具有潜力。

Method: 提出HapticLLaMA模型，结合频率和EnCodec两种触觉分词器，通过两阶段训练（监督微调和强化学习）优化模型。

Result: 模型在METEOR和BLEU-4指标上表现优异，人类评价中61%的生成描述评分超过3.5（7分制），强化学习带来10%的提升。

Conclusion: 研究表明大语言模型能有效处理感官数据，为触觉信号的自然语言描述提供了新方向。

Abstract: Haptic captioning is the task of generating natural language descriptions
from haptic signals, such as vibrations, for use in virtual reality,
accessibility, and rehabilitation applications. While previous multimodal
research has focused primarily on vision and audio, haptic signals for the
sense of touch remain underexplored. To address this gap, we formalize the
haptic captioning task and propose HapticLLaMA, a multimodal sensory language
model that interprets vibration signals into descriptions in a given sensory,
emotional, or associative category. We investigate two types of haptic
tokenizers, a frequency-based tokenizer and an EnCodec-based tokenizer, that
convert haptic signals into sequences of discrete units, enabling their
integration with the LLaMA model. HapticLLaMA is trained in two stages: (1)
supervised fine-tuning using the LLaMA architecture with LoRA-based adaptation,
and (2) fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We
assess HapticLLaMA's captioning performance using both automated n-gram metrics
and human evaluation. HapticLLaMA demonstrates strong capability in
interpreting haptic vibration signals, achieving a METEOR score of 59.98 and a
BLEU-4 score of 32.06 respectively. Additionally, over 61% of the generated
captions received human ratings above 3.5 on a 7-point scale, with RLHF
yielding a 10% improvement in the overall rating distribution, indicating
stronger alignment with human haptic perception. These findings highlight the
potential of large language models to process and adapt to sensory data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在多轮交互中能高效适应语言并形成临时约定，而现有LLMs缺乏这一能力。

Method: 采用后训练过程，通过启发式识别的约定形成示例进行微调。

Result: 后训练的LLMs在两个新基准上表现出显著提升的约定形成能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLMs在多轮交互中的约定形成能力。

Abstract: Humans communicate with increasing efficiency in multi-turn interactions, by
adapting their language and forming ad-hoc conventions. In contrast, prior work
shows that LLMs do not naturally show this behavior. We develop a post-training
process to develop this ability through targeted fine-tuning on heuristically
identified demonstrations of convention formation. We evaluate with two new
benchmarks focused on this capability. First, we design a focused,
cognitively-motivated interaction benchmark that consistently elicits strong
convention formation trends in humans. Second, we create a new
document-grounded reference completion task that reflects in-the-wild
convention formation behavior. Our studies show significantly improved
convention formation abilities in post-trained LLMs across the two evaluation
methods.

TL;DR: BR-MPPI方法通过嵌入CBF约束改进MPPI，提升在复杂环境中导航的鲁棒性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在行人密集的复杂环境中实现铰接车辆（如拖车）的安全导航。

Method: BR-MPPI将CBF约束直接嵌入路径积分更新，引导采样分布朝向无碰撞、动态可行的轨迹。

Result: 在CarMaker模拟器中，BR-MPPI在12米拖车的倒车和前进停车任务中表现优于标准MPPI和带碰撞成本的MPPI。

Conclusion: BR-MPPI显著提升了导航的鲁棒性和计算效率，适用于复杂环境中的车辆控制。

Abstract: Articulated vehicles such as tractor-trailers, yard trucks, and similar
platforms must often reverse and maneuver in cluttered spaces where pedestrians
are present. We present how Barrier-Rate guided Model Predictive Path Integral
(BR-MPPI) control can solve navigation in such challenging environments.
BR-MPPI embeds Control Barrier Function (CBF) constraints directly into the
path-integral update. By steering the importance-sampling distribution toward
collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories, BR-MPPI enhances the
exploration strength of MPPI and improves robustness of resulting trajectories.
The method is evaluated in the high-fidelity CarMaker simulator on a 12 [m]
tractor-trailer tasked with reverse and forward parking in a parking lot.
BR-MPPI computes control inputs in above 100 [Hz] on a single GPU (for
scenarios with eight obstacles) and maintains better parking clearance than a
standard MPPI baseline and an MPPI with collision cost baseline.

Conclusion: 模块化真空夹具系统显著提升了复杂几何形状物体的拆卸效率和稳定性。

Abstract: The disassembly of small household appliances poses significant challenges
due to their complex and curved geometries, which render traditional rigid
fixtures inadequate. In this paper, we propose a modular vacuum-based fixturing
system that leverages commercially available balloon-type soft grippers to
conform to arbitrarily shaped surfaces and provide stable support during
screw-removal tasks. To enable a reliable deployment of the system, we develop
a stability-aware planning framework that samples the bottom surface of the
target object, filters candidate contact points based on geometric continuity,
and evaluates support configurations using convex hull-based static stability
criteria. We compare the quality of object placement under different numbers
and configurations of balloon hands. In addition, real-world experiments were
conducted to compare the success rates of traditional rigid fixtures with our
proposed system. The results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves
higher success rates and superior placement stability during screw removal
tasks.

Abstract: Robotic non-destructive disassembly of mating parts remains challenging due
to the need for flexible manipulation and the limited visibility of internal

enables intuitive human demonstrations for dual-arm fix-and-disassemble tasks
for mating parts. The system visualizes feasible grasp poses and disassembly
directions in a virtual environment, both derived from the object's geometry,
to address occlusions and structural complexity. To prevent excessive position
tracking under load when following the affordance, we integrate a hybrid
controller that combines position and impedance control into the teleoperated
disassembly arm. Real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the
proposed system, showing improved task success rates and reduced object pose

TL;DR: LPB框架通过将专家演示的潜在嵌入作为隐式屏障，分离安全与不安全状态，提升视觉运动策略的鲁棒性和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为克隆训练的视觉运动策略易受协变量偏移影响，现有方法依赖人工修正或数据增强，成本高且效果有限。

Method: LPB框架包含基础扩散策略和动态模型，前者基于专家数据，后者结合专家和次优策略数据，推理时优化潜在状态以保持在专家分布内。

Result: 实验表明LPB提高了策略鲁棒性和数据效率，无需额外人工修正即可实现可靠操作。

Conclusion: LPB为有限专家数据下的鲁棒策略学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Visuomotor policies trained via behavior cloning are vulnerable to covariate
shift, where small deviations from expert trajectories can compound into
failure. Common strategies to mitigate this issue involve expanding the
training distribution through human-in-the-loop corrections or synthetic data
augmentation. However, these approaches are often labor-intensive, rely on
strong task assumptions, or compromise the quality of imitation. We introduce
Latent Policy Barrier, a framework for robust visuomotor policy learning.
Inspired by Control Barrier Functions, LPB treats the latent embeddings of
expert demonstrations as an implicit barrier separating safe, in-distribution
states from unsafe, out-of-distribution (OOD) ones. Our approach decouples the
role of precise expert imitation and OOD recovery into two separate modules: a
base diffusion policy solely on expert data, and a dynamics model trained on
both expert and suboptimal policy rollout data. At inference time, the dynamics
model predicts future latent states and optimizes them to stay within the
expert distribution. Both simulated and real-world experiments show that LPB
improves both policy robustness and data efficiency, enabling reliable
manipulation from limited expert data and without additional human correction
or annotation.

remotely. From a research perspective, key topics include storytelling, robot
personality, empathy, personalization, and, in the case of telepresence,
collaboration between the robot and the person, with clearly defined roles and
autonomy.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了双模态车辆在扰动环境中的适应性和可靠性。

Abstract: Air-land bimodal vehicles provide a promising solution for navigating complex
environments by combining the flexibility of aerial locomotion with the energy
efficiency of ground mobility. To enhance the robustness of trajectory planning
under environmental disturbances, this paper presents a disturbance-aware
planning framework that incorporates real-time disturbance estimation into both
path searching and trajectory optimization. A key component of the framework is
a disturbance-adaptive safety boundary adjustment mechanism, which dynamically
modifies the vehicle's feasible dynamic boundaries based on estimated
disturbances to ensure trajectory feasibility. Leveraging the dynamics model of
the bimodal vehicle, the proposed approach achieves adaptive and reliable
motion planning across different terrains and operating conditions. A series of
real-world experiments and benchmark comparisons on a custom-built platform
validate the effectiveness and robustness of the method, demonstrating
improvements in tracking accuracy, task efficiency, and energy performance
under both ground and aerial disturbances.

TL;DR: ReNiL是一个基于贝叶斯深度学习的框架，用于高效、准确且具有不确定性感知的行人惯性定位，通过引入IPDPs和ASLE技术，实现了多尺度运动适应和一致的轨迹估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习型惯性定位方法依赖固定滑动窗口，难以适应多样化的运动尺度和步频，且不确定性估计不一致，限制了实际应用。

Method: ReNiL结合了运动感知方向滤波器和Any-Scale Laplace Estimator（ASLE），通过IPDPs实现上下文相关的运动估计，支持任意尺度的IMU序列推理。

Result: 在RoNIN-ds和WUDataset上，ReNiL在位移精度和不确定性一致性上达到最优，计算效率更高。

Conclusion: ReNiL为移动和IoT定位提供了可扩展且不确定性感知的基础，具有实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Pedestrian inertial localization is key for mobile and IoT services because
it provides infrastructure-free positioning. Yet most learning-based methods
depend on fixed sliding-window integration, struggle to adapt to diverse motion
scales and cadences, and yield inconsistent uncertainty, limiting real-world
use. We present ReNiL, a Bayesian deep-learning framework for accurate,
efficient, and uncertainty-aware pedestrian localization. ReNiL introduces
Inertial Positioning Demand Points (IPDPs) to estimate motion at contextually
meaningful waypoints instead of dense tracking, and supports inference on IMU
sequences at any scale so cadence can match application needs. It couples a
motion-aware orientation filter with an Any-Scale Laplace Estimator (ASLE), a
dual-task network that blends patch-based self-supervision with Bayesian
regression. By modeling displacements with a Laplace distribution, ReNiL
provides homogeneous Euclidean uncertainty that integrates cleanly with other
sensors. A Bayesian inference chain links successive IPDPs into consistent
trajectories. On RoNIN-ds and a new WUDataset covering indoor and outdoor
motion from 28 participants, ReNiL achieves state-of-the-art displacement
accuracy and uncertainty consistency, outperforming TLIO, CTIN, iMoT, and RoNIN
variants while reducing computation. Application studies further show
robustness and practicality for mobile and IoT localization, making ReNiL a
scalable, uncertainty-aware foundation for next-generation positioning.

Result: 在真实人机交互场景中验证了系统能在线调整目标姿态、约束或任务目标。

Conclusion: 结合增量语言理解与实时运动规划，实现了更自然流畅的人机协作。

Abstract: Human-robot interaction requires robots to process language incrementally,
adapting their actions in real-time based on evolving speech input. Existing
approaches to language-guided robot motion planning typically assume fully
specified instructions, resulting in inefficient stop-and-replan behavior when
corrections or clarifications occur. In this paper, we introduce a novel
reasoning-based incremental parser which integrates an online motion planning
algorithm within the cognitive architecture. Our approach enables continuous
adaptation to dynamic linguistic input, allowing robots to update motion plans
without restarting execution. The incremental parser maintains multiple
candidate parses, leveraging reasoning mechanisms to resolve ambiguities and
revise interpretations when needed. By combining symbolic reasoning with online
motion planning, our system achieves greater flexibility in handling speech
corrections and dynamically changing constraints. We evaluate our framework in
real-world human-robot interaction scenarios, demonstrating online adaptions of
goal poses, constraints, or task objectives. Our results highlight the
advantages of integrating incremental language understanding with real-time
motion planning for natural and fluid human-robot collaboration. The
experiments are demonstrated in the accompanying video at

Result: 在模拟机器人环境中实验表明，该方法在数据效率上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了模型规划算法的鲁棒性和数据效率。

Abstract: Recent work on visual world models shows significant promise in latent state
dynamics obtained from pre-trained image backbones. However, most of the
current approaches are sensitive to training quality, requiring near-complete
coverage of the action and state space during training to prevent divergence
during inference. To make a model-based planning algorithm more robust to the
quality of the learned world model, we propose in this work to use a
variational autoencoder as a novelty detector to ensure that proposed action
trajectories during planning do not cause the learned model to deviate from the
training data distribution. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, a
series of experiments in challenging simulated robot environments was carried
out, with the proposed method incorporated into a model-predictive control
policy loop extending the DINO-WM architecture. The results clearly show that
the proposed method improves over state-of-the-art solutions in terms of data
efficiency.

Conclusion: HyperPM在保持计算效率的同时，提升了动态模型的预测能力，适用于复杂系统。

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is among the most widely adopted and reliable
methods for robot control, relying critically on an accurate dynamics model.
However, existing dynamics models used in the gradient-based MPC are limited by
computational complexity and state representation. To address this limitation,
we propose the Hyper Prediction Model (HyperPM) - a novel approach in which we
project the unmodeled dynamics onto a time-dependent dynamics model. This
time-dependency is captured through time-varying model parameters, whose
evolution over the MPC prediction horizon is learned using a neural network.
Such formulation preserves the computational efficiency and robustness of the
base model while equipping it with the capacity to anticipate previously
unmodeled phenomena. We evaluated the proposed approach on several challenging
systems, including real-world F1TENTH autonomous racing, and demonstrated that
it significantly reduces long-horizon prediction errors. Moreover, when
integrated within the MPC framework (HyperMPC), our method consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: Affordance-R1首次将GRPO强化学习与推理结合，为affordance reasoning提供了新思路，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Affordance grounding focuses on predicting the specific regions of objects
that are associated with the actions to be performed by robots. It plays a
vital role in the fields of human-robot interaction, human-object interaction,
embodied manipulation, and embodied perception. Existing models often neglect
the affordance shared among different objects because they lack the
Chain-of-Thought(CoT) reasoning abilities, limiting their out-of-domain (OOD)
generalization and explicit reasoning capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose Affordance-R1, the first unified affordance grounding
framework that integrates cognitive CoT guided Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement learning paradigm. Specifically, we
designed a sophisticated affordance function, which contains format,
perception, and cognition rewards to effectively guide optimization directions.
Furthermore, we constructed a high-quality affordance-centric reasoning
dataset, ReasonAff, to support training. Trained exclusively via reinforcement
learning with GRPO and without explicit reasoning data, Affordance-R1 achieves
robust zero-shot generalization and exhibits emergent test-time reasoning
capabilities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms
well-established methods and exhibits open-world generalization. To the best of
our knowledge, Affordance-R1 is the first to integrate GRPO-based RL with
reasoning into affordance reasoning. The code of our method and our dataset is
released on https://github.com/hq-King/Affordance-R1.

Abstract: Back exoskeletons can reduce musculoskeletal strain, but their effectiveness
depends on support modulation and adaptive control. This study addresses two
challenges: defining optimal support strategies and developing adaptive control
based on payload estimation. We introduce an optimization space based on muscle
activity reduction, perceived discomfort, and user preference, constructing
functions to identify optimal strategies. Experiments with 12 subjects revealed
optimal operating regions, highlighting the need for dynamic modulation. Based
on these insights, we developed a vision-based adaptive control pipeline that
estimates payloads in real-time by enhancing exoskeleton contextual
understanding, minimising latency and enabling support adaptation within the
defined optimisation space. Validation with 12 more subjects showed over 80%
accuracy and improvements across all metrics. Compared to static control,
adaptive modulation reduced peak back muscle activation by up to 23% while
preserving user preference and minimising discomfort. These findings validate
the proposed framework and highlight the potential of intelligent,
context-aware control in industrial exoskeletons.

Abstract: Dynamic obstacle avoidance (DOA) is critical for quadrupedal robots operating
in environments with moving obstacles or humans. Existing approaches typically
rely on navigation-based trajectory replanning, which assumes sufficient
reaction time and leading to fails when obstacles approach rapidly. In such
scenarios, quadrupedal robots require reflexive evasion capabilities to perform
instantaneous, low-latency maneuvers. This paper introduces Reflexive Evasion
Robot (REBot), a control framework that enables quadrupedal robots to achieve
real-time reflexive obstacle avoidance. REBot integrates an avoidance policy
and a recovery policy within a finite-state machine. With carefully designed
learning curricula and by incorporating regularization and adaptive rewards,
REBot achieves robust evasion and rapid stabilization in instantaneous DOA
tasks. We validate REBot through extensive simulations and real-world
experiments, demonstrating notable improvements in avoidance success rates,
energy efficiency, and robustness to fast-moving obstacles. Videos and appendix

Conclusion: ADP无需重新训练即可适配新任务，显著提升机器人操作的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have recently emerged as a powerful class of visuomotor
controllers for robot manipulation, offering stable training and expressive
multi-modal action modeling. However, existing approaches typically treat
action generation as an unconstrained denoising process, ignoring valuable a
priori knowledge about geometry and control structure. In this work, we propose
the Adaptive Diffusion Policy (ADP), a test-time adaptation method that
introduces two key inductive biases into the diffusion. First, we embed a
geometric manifold constraint that aligns denoising updates with task-relevant
subspaces, leveraging the fact that the relative pose between the end-effector
and target scene provides a natural gradient direction, and guiding denoising
along the geodesic path of the manipulation manifold. Then, to reduce
unnecessary exploration and accelerate convergence, we propose an analytically
guided initialization: rather than sampling from an uninformative prior, we
compute a rough registration between the gripper and target scenes to propose a
structured initial noisy action. ADP is compatible with pre-trained diffusion
policies and requires no retraining, enabling test-time adaptation that tailors
the policy to specific tasks, thereby enhancing generalization across novel
tasks and environments. Experiments on RLBench, CALVIN, and real-world dataset
show that ADPro, an implementation of ADP, improves success rates,
generalization, and sampling efficiency, achieving up to 25% faster execution
and 9% points over strong diffusion baselines.

often lack accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce an open source
Matlab-based library designed to automatically generate \ac{ec} models for
manipulators. The necessary inputs for the library are Denavit-Hartenberg
parameters, link masses, and centers of mass. Additionally, our model is
data-driven and requires real operational data, including joint positions,
velocities, accelerations, electrical power, and corresponding timestamps. We
validated our methodology by testing on four lightweight robots sourced from
three distinct manufacturers: Universal Robots, Franka Emika, and Kinova. The
model underwent testing, and the results demonstrated an RMSE ranging from 1.42
W to 2.80 W for the training dataset and from 1.45 W to 5.25 W for the testing
dataset.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为PPR-AKG的语义模型，用于分析和缓解工业4.0中灵活CPPS的不良条件，结合了语义技术和大型语言模型（LLMs），并通过电动汽车电池再制造的案例验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业4.0的灵活性破坏了传统的质量保证机制，导致CPPS中不良条件的分析面临挑战。

Method: 基于PPR模型，开发了PPR-AKG语义模型，结合OWL本体和LLMs，提供自然语言交互界面。

Result: PPR-AKG在电动汽车电池再制造案例中有效支持资源分配和不良条件的识别与缓解。

Conclusion: PPR-AKG模型和与LLM聊天机器人的结合为CPPS提供了多维生产知识表示和直观的人机交互方式。

Abstract: Contemporary industrial cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) composed of
robotic workcells face significant challenges in the analysis of undesired
conditions due to the flexibility of Industry 4.0 that disrupts traditional
quality assurance mechanisms. This paper presents a novel industry-oriented
semantic model called Product-Process-Resource Asset Knowledge Graph (PPR-AKG),
which is designed to analyze and mitigate undesired conditions in flexible
CPPS. Built on top of the well-proven Product-Process-Resource (PPR) model
originating from ISA-95 and VDI-3682, a comprehensive OWL ontology addresses
shortcomings of conventional model-driven engineering for CPPS, particularly
inadequate undesired condition and error handling representation. The
integration of semantic technologies with large language models (LLMs) provides
intuitive interfaces for factory operators, production planners, and engineers
to interact with the entire model using natural language. Evaluation with the
use case addressing electric vehicle battery remanufacturing demonstrates that
the PPR-AKG approach efficiently supports resource allocation based on
explicitly represented capabilities as well as identification and mitigation of
undesired conditions in production. The key contributions include (1) a
holistic PPR-AKG model capturing multi-dimensional production knowledge, and
(2) the useful combination of the PPR-AKG with LLM-based chatbots for human
interaction.

TL;DR: S-Path利用3D场景图的语义结构，通过两阶段规划和动态重规划机制，显著提升路径规划效率，同时保持路径最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D场景图的结构未被充分利用以提升路径规划的效率和可解释性。

Method: S-Path采用两阶段规划：先在语义图上搜索高层路径，再分解为并行子问题；并引入动态重规划机制。

Result: 实验显示，S-Path平均减少5.7倍规划时间，路径最优性与传统方法相当，复杂场景表现更优。

Conclusion: S-Path是一种高效且可解释的路径规划方法，适用于室内3D场景图环境。

Abstract: 3D Scene Graphs integrate both metric and semantic information, yet their
structure remains underutilized for improving path planning efficiency and
interpretability. In this work, we present S-Path, a situationally-aware path
planner that leverages the metric-semantic structure of indoor 3D Scene Graphs
to significantly enhance planning efficiency. S-Path follows a two-stage
process: it first performs a search over a semantic graph derived from the
scene graph to yield a human-understandable high-level path. This also
identifies relevant regions for planning, which later allows the decomposition
of the problem into smaller, independent subproblems that can be solved in
parallel. We also introduce a replanning mechanism that, in the event of an
infeasible path, reuses information from previously solved subproblems to
update semantic heuristics and prioritize reuse to further improve the
efficiency of future planning attempts. Extensive experiments on both
real-world and simulated environments show that S-Path achieves average
reductions of 5.7x in planning time while maintaining comparable path
optimality to classical sampling-based planners and surpassing them in complex
scenarios, making it an efficient and interpretable path planner for
environments represented by indoor 3D Scene Graphs.

Conclusion: 该方法适用于多种交互式机器人任务，仅需原始图像数据即可实现高效语义表示。

Abstract: A metric-accurate semantic 3D representation is essential for many robotic
tasks. This work proposes a simple, yet powerful, way to integrate the 2D
embeddings of a Vision-Language Model in a metric-accurate 3D representation at
real-time. We combine a local embedding masking strategy, for a more distinct
embedding distribution, with a confidence-weighted 3D integration for more
reliable 3D embeddings. The resulting metric-accurate embedding representation
is task-agnostic and can represent semantic concepts on a global multi-room, as
well as on a local object-level. This enables a variety of interactive robotic
applications that require the localisation of objects-of-interest via natural
language. We evaluate our approach on a variety of real-world sequences and
demonstrate that these strategies achieve a more accurate object-of-interest
localisation while improving the runtime performance in order to meet our
real-time constraints. We further demonstrate the versatility of our approach
in a variety of interactive handheld, mobile robotics and manipulation tasks,
requiring only raw image data.

Result: 实验案例展示了四种不同策略的程序在UR5e机器人上的表现，揭示了各策略的优缺点。

Conclusion: 该框架为优化机器人编程提供了实用见解，支持可持续制造和成本降低等工业目标。

Abstract: The code performance of industrial robots is typically analyzed through CPU
metrics, which overlook the physical impact of code on robot behavior. This
study introduces a novel framework for assessing robot program performance from
an embodiment perspective by analyzing the robot's electrical power profile.
Our approach diverges from conventional CPU based evaluations and instead
leverages a suite of normalized metrics, namely, the energy utilization
coefficient, the energy conversion metric, and the reliability coefficient, to
capture how efficiently and reliably energy is used during task execution.
Complementing these metrics, the established robot wear metric provides further
insight into long term reliability. Our approach is demonstrated through an
experimental case study in machine tending, comparing four programs with
diverse strategies using a UR5e robot. The proposed metrics directly compare
and categorize different robot programs, regardless of the specific task, by
linking code performance to its physical manifestation through power
consumption patterns. Our results reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each
strategy, offering actionable insights for optimizing robot programming
practices. Enhancing energy efficiency and reliability through this embodiment
centric approach not only improves individual robot performance but also
supports broader industrial objectives such as sustainable manufacturing and
cost reduction.

Result: 在多域仿真和实验验证中，控制器实现了亚厘米级的笛卡尔跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 研究表明，嵌入虚拟分解控制的代理增强模型能够有效支持全电动重型机械臂的模块化实时控制。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified system-level modeling and control framework for
an all-electric heavy-duty robotic manipulator (HDRM) driven by
electromechanical linear actuators (EMLAs). A surrogate-enhanced actuator
model, combining integrated electromechanical dynamics with a neural network
trained on a dedicated testbed, is integrated into an extended virtual
decomposition control (VDC) architecture augmented by a natural adaptation law.
The derived analytical HDRM model supports a hierarchical control structure
that seamlessly maps high-level force and velocity objectives to real-time
actuator commands, accompanied by a Lyapunov-based stability proof. In
multi-domain simulations of both cubic and a custom planar triangular
trajectory, the proposed adaptive modular controller achieves sub-centimeter
Cartesian tracking accuracy. Experimental validation of the same 1-DoF platform
under realistic load emulation confirms the efficacy of the proposed control
strategy. These findings demonstrate that a surrogate-enhanced EMLA model
embedded in the VDC approach can enable modular, real-time control of an
all-electric HDRM, supporting its deployment in next-generation mobile working
machines.

Result: 实验表明，重新平衡数据集能提升模仿学习的性能，无需额外数据收集。

Conclusion: 数据重新平衡是提升模仿学习性能的有效方法，新算法解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Robots should be able to learn complex behaviors from human demonstrations.
In practice, these human-provided datasets are inevitably imbalanced: i.e., the
human demonstrates some subtasks more frequently than others. State-of-the-art
methods default to treating each element of the human's dataset as equally
important. So if -- for instance -- the majority of the human's data focuses on
reaching a goal, and only a few state-action pairs move to avoid an obstacle,
the learning algorithm will place greater emphasis on goal reaching. More
generally, misalignment between the relative amounts of data and the importance
of that data causes fundamental problems for imitation learning approaches. In
this paper we analyze and develop learning methods that automatically account
for mixed datasets. We formally prove that imbalanced data leads to imbalanced
policies when each state-action pair is weighted equally; these policies
emulate the most represented behaviors, and not the human's complex, multi-task
demonstrations. We next explore algorithms that rebalance offline datasets
(i.e., reweight the importance of different state-action pairs) without human
oversight. Reweighting the dataset can enhance the overall policy performance.
However, there is no free lunch: each method for autonomously rebalancing
brings its own pros and cons. We formulate these advantages and disadvantages,
helping other researchers identify when each type of approach is most
appropriate. We conclude by introducing a novel meta-gradient rebalancing
algorithm that addresses the primary limitations behind existing approaches.
Our experiments show that dataset rebalancing leads to better downstream
learning, improving the performance of general imitation learning algorithms
without requiring additional data collection. See our project website:

Motivation: 现有外参标定方法依赖结构化目标或充分激励数据，限制了实际应用；在线标定在弱激励条件下不可靠。

Method: 将外参标定建模为决策问题，使用Bingham分布建模3D旋转，设计轨迹对齐奖励机制和自动化数据选择模块。

Result: 在无人机、地面机器人和手持平台上实验表明，该方法在弱激励条件下优于传统优化方法。

Conclusion: 该框架简化了多样化机器人平台的外参标定，可从常规操作数据中实现高精度标定。

Abstract: Extrinsic calibration is essential for multi-sensor fusion, existing methods
rely on structured targets or fully-excited data, limiting real-world
applicability. Online calibration further suffers from weak excitation, leading
to unreliable estimates. To address these limitations, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based extrinsic calibration framework that
formulates extrinsic calibration as a decision-making problem, directly
optimizes $SE(3)$ extrinsics to enhance odometry accuracy. Our approach
leverages a probabilistic Bingham distribution to model 3D rotations, ensuring
stable optimization while inherently retaining quaternion symmetry. A
trajectory alignment reward mechanism enables robust calibration without
structured targets by quantitatively evaluating estimated tightly-coupled
trajectory against a reference trajectory. Additionally, an automated data
selection module filters uninformative samples, significantly improving
efficiency and scalability for large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments on
UAVs, UGVs, and handheld platforms demonstrate that our method outperforms
traditional optimization-based approaches, achieving high-precision calibration
even under weak excitation conditions. Our framework simplifies deployment on
diverse robotic platforms by eliminating the need for high-quality initial
extrinsics and enabling calibration from routine operating data. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在结构化环境中，自动驾驶车辆需要能够生成满足动态和运动学约束的时间最优轨迹的规划器。传统方法通常解耦空间搜索与动态可行性，或依赖后处理平滑，导致效率不足。

Method: V*采用六边形离散化策略，动态生成图结构，结合数学证明优化节点间距和冗余。通过建模转向动力学和几何剪枝策略，确保轨迹动态可行。

Result: 仿真研究表明，V*能在复杂动态环境中避免冲突，主动让行，并生成安全高效的轨迹，具备时间推理能力。

Conclusion: V*通过直接整合动态约束和几何优化，显著提升了运动规划的效率和可行性，适用于复杂环境中的自动驾驶导航。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation in structured environments requires planners
capable of generating time-optimal, collision-free trajectories that satisfy
dynamic and kinematic constraints. We introduce V*, a graph-based motion
planner that represents speed and direction as explicit state variables within
a discretised space-time-velocity lattice. Unlike traditional methods that
decouple spatial search from dynamic feasibility or rely on post-hoc smoothing,
V* integrates both motion dimensions directly into graph construction through
dynamic graph generation during search expansion. To manage the complexity of
high-dimensional search, we employ a hexagonal discretisation strategy and
provide formal mathematical proofs establishing optimal waypoint spacing and
minimal node redundancy under constrained heading transitions for
velocity-aware motion planning. We develop a mathematical formulation for
transient steering dynamics in the kinematic bicycle model, modelling steering
angle convergence with exponential behaviour, and deriving the relationship for
convergence rate parameters. This theoretical foundation, combined with
geometric pruning strategies that eliminate expansions leading to infeasible
steering configurations, enables V* to evaluate dynamically admissible
manoeuvres, ensuring each trajectory is physically realisable without further
refinement. We further demonstrate V*'s performance in simulation studies with
cluttered and dynamic environments involving moving obstacles, showing its
ability to avoid conflicts, yield proactively, and generate safe, efficient
trajectories with temporal reasoning capabilities for waiting behaviours and
dynamic coordination.

Motivation: 通用机器人策略在大型数据集上表现良好，但泛化能力有限，研究旨在揭示其根本原因并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，识别捷径学习的两个主要原因：子数据集多样性不足和分布差异导致的数据集碎片化。

Result: 发现数据集结构和收集策略对捷径学习有显著影响，提出数据增强策略可改善泛化能力。

Conclusion: 优化数据集收集和增强策略可减少捷径学习，提升通用机器人策略的泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale datasets such as Open
X-Embodiment (OXE) demonstrate strong performance across a wide range of tasks.
However, they often struggle to generalize beyond the distribution of their
training data. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of this
limited generalization capability. We identify shortcut learning -- the
reliance on task-irrelevant features -- as a key impediment to generalization.
Through comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we uncover two
primary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited diversity within
individual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities across
sub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation. These issues arise from the
inherent structure of large-scale datasets like OXE, which are typically
composed of multiple sub-datasets collected independently across varied
environments and embodiments. Our findings provide critical insights into
dataset collection strategies that can reduce shortcut learning and enhance the
generalization ability of generalist robot policies. Moreover, in scenarios
where acquiring new large-scale data is impractical, we demonstrate that
carefully selected robotic data augmentation strategies can effectively reduce
shortcut learning in existing offline datasets, thereby improving
generalization capabilities of generalist robot policies, e.g., $\pi_0$, in
both simulation and real-world environments. More information at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在GUI操作中需要精确的空间和语义对齐，但现有方法在语义对齐上存在探索效率低的问题。

Method: 提出AEPO框架，采用多答案生成策略和自适应探索奖励函数（AER）来优化探索过程。

Result: AEPO训练的模型在多个GUI基准测试中达到新SOTA，相对基线提升高达9.0%。

Conclusion: AEPO有效解决了语义对齐的探索瓶颈，为MLLMs在GUI操作中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has propelled the
development of autonomous agents that operate on Graphical User Interfaces
(GUIs) using pure visual input. A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding
natural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which
accurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a
correct semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally
appropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these
MLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment,
which prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address
this exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization
(AEPO), a new policy optimization framework. AEPO employs a multi-answer
generation strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a
theoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from
first principles of efficiency eta=U/C. Our AEPO-trained models, InfiGUI-G1-3B
and InfiGUI-G1-7B, establish new state-of-the-art results across multiple
challenging GUI grounding benchmarks, achieving significant relative
improvements of up to 9.0% against the naive RLVR baseline on benchmarks
designed to test generalization and semantic understanding. Resources are

Conclusion: 该框架为AGI开发提供了一条更安全的发展路径，并提出了基于ARC基准的研究议程。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for developing safe Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) by combining Active Inference principles with Large Language
Models (LLMs). We argue that traditional approaches to AI safety, focused on
post-hoc interpretability and reward engineering, have fundamental limitations.
We present an architecture where safety guarantees are integrated into the
system's core design through transparent belief representations and
hierarchical value alignment. Our framework leverages natural language as a
medium for representing and manipulating beliefs, enabling direct human
oversight while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture
implements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active
Inference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through
hierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring
safety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in
natural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy
minimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures.
The paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and
Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our
framework's safety properties. Our approach offers a path toward AGI
development that is inherently safer, rather than retrofitted with safety
measures.

Conclusion: 提出新的研究议程，重新思考人类思维的符号基础。

Abstract: Some of the strongest evidence that human minds should be thought about in
terms of symbolic systems has been the way they combine ideas, produce novelty,
and learn quickly. We argue that modern neural networks -- and the artificial
intelligence systems built upon them -- exhibit similar abilities. This
undermines the argument that the cognitive processes and representations used
by human minds are symbolic, although the fact that these neural networks are
typically trained on data generated by symbolic systems illustrates that such
systems play an important role in characterizing the abstract problems that
human minds have to solve. This argument leads us to offer a new agenda for
research on the symbolic basis of human thought.

Conclusion: H-XAI填补了现有XAI方法的空白，结合因果评分和后验解释，满足个体决策和整体模型层面的需求。

Abstract: Current eXplainable AI (XAI) methods largely serve developers, often focusing
on justifying model outputs rather than supporting diverse stakeholder needs. A
recent shift toward Evaluative AI reframes explanation as a tool for hypothesis
testing, but still focuses primarily on operational organizations. We introduce
Holistic-XAI (H-XAI), a unified framework that integrates causal rating methods
with traditional XAI methods to support explanation as an interactive,
multi-method process. H-XAI allows stakeholders to ask a series of questions,
test hypotheses, and compare model behavior against automatically constructed
random and biased baselines. It combines instance-level and global
explanations, adapting to each stakeholder's goals, whether understanding
individual decisions, assessing group-level bias, or evaluating robustness
under perturbations. We demonstrate the generality of our approach through two
case studies spanning six scenarios: binary credit risk classification and
financial time-series forecasting. H-XAI fills critical gaps left by existing
XAI methods by combining causal ratings and post-hoc explanations to answer
stakeholder-specific questions at both the individual decision level and the
overall model level.

their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring the safety of
such systems is critical. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of
safety in embodied navigation from multiple perspectives, encompassing attack
strategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Beyond conducting
a comprehensive examination of existing safety challenges, mitigation
technologies, and various datasets and metrics that assess effectiveness and
robustness, we explore unresolved issues and future research directions in
embodied navigation safety. These include potential attack methods, mitigation
strategies, more reliable evaluation techniques, and the implementation of
verification frameworks. By addressing these critical gaps, this survey aims to
provide valuable insights that can guide future research toward the development

array of tools when identifying and planning actions in the context of complex
user queries. Despite its central role in planning, this aspect remains
underexplored in the literature. Traditional approaches rely primarily on
similarities between user queries and tool descriptions, which significantly
limits retrieval accuracy, specifically when handling multi-step user requests.
To address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge Graph (KG)-based tool
retrieval framework that captures the semantic relationships between tools and
their functional dependencies. Our retrieval algorithm leverages ensembles of
1-hop ego tool graphs to model direct and indirect connections between tools,
enabling more comprehensive and contextual tool selection for multi-step tasks.
We evaluate our approach on a synthetically generated internal dataset across
six defined user classes, extending previous work on coherent dialogue
synthesis and too retrieval benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our tool
graph-based method achieves 91.85% tool coverage on the micro-average Complete
Recall metric, compared to 89.26% for re-ranked semantic-lexical hybrid
retrieval, the strongest non-KG baseline in our experiments. These findings
support our hypothesis that the structural information in the KG provides
complementary signals to pure similarity matching, particularly for queries
requiring sequential tool composition.

Motivation: 现有多代理系统主要针对语言任务，多模态场景扩展困难，且VLMs在指令跟随和自反思能力上弱于LLMs，限制了协作能力。

Method: 提出MedOrch框架，利用LLM中介协调多个VLM专家代理，通过输出交换与反思实现协作。

Result: 在五个医疗视觉问答基准上验证，协作性能超越单个代理，无需模型训练。

Conclusion: 中介引导的多代理协作可推动医疗多模态智能发展。

Abstract: Complex medical decision-making involves cooperative workflows operated by
different clinicians. Designing AI multi-agent systems can expedite and augment
human-level clinical decision-making. Existing multi-agent researches primarily
focus on language-only tasks, yet their extension to multimodal scenarios
remains challenging. A blind combination of diverse vision-language models
(VLMs) can amplify an erroneous outcome interpretation. VLMs in general are
less capable in instruction following and importantly self-reflection, compared
to large language models (LLMs) of comparable sizes. This disparity largely
constrains VLMs' ability in cooperative workflows. In this study, we propose
MedOrch, a mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration framework for medical
multimodal decision-making. MedOrch employs an LLM-based mediator agent that
enables multiple VLM-based expert agents to exchange and reflect on their
outputs towards collaboration. We utilize multiple open-source general-purpose
and domain-specific VLMs instead of costly GPT-series models, revealing the
strength of heterogeneous models. We show that the collaboration within
distinct VLM-based agents can surpass the capabilities of any individual agent.
We validate our approach on five medical vision question answering benchmarks,
demonstrating superior collaboration performance without model training. Our
findings underscore the value of mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration in
advancing medical multimodal intelligence. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HIMA的分层多智能体框架，结合专家模仿学习和元控制器，用于提升LLM在动态、长时任务（如《星际争霸II》）中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在动态、长时任务（如《星际争霸II》）中表现不佳，难以处理资源约束和部分可观测环境下的适应性需求。

Method: 采用分层多智能体框架（HIMA），包括专家模仿学习智能体和元控制器（SP），通过专家演示学习特定策略，并由SP协调生成适应性计划。

Result: HIMA在战略清晰性、适应性和计算效率上优于现有方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 结合专家模仿模块和元级协调可以开发更鲁棒、通用的AI智能体。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive action
sequence prediction capabilities but often struggle with dynamic, long-horizon
tasks such as real-time strategic games. In a game such as StarCraftII (SC2),
agents need to manage resource constraints and adapt to evolving battlefield
situations in a partially observable environment. This often overwhelms
exisiting LLM-based approaches. To address these challenges, we propose a
hierarchical multi-agent framework that employs specialized imitation learning
agents under a meta-controller called Strategic Planner (SP). By expert
demonstrations, each specialized agent learns a distinctive strategy, such as
aerial support or defensive maneuvers, and produces coherent, structured
multistep action sequences. The SP then orchestrates these proposals into a
single, environmentally adaptive plan that ensures local decisions aligning
with long-term strategies. We call this HIMA (Hierarchical Imitation
Multi-Agent). We also present TEXTSCII-ALL, a comprehensive SC2 testbed that
encompasses all race match combinations in SC2. Our empirical results show that
HIMA outperforms state of the arts in strategic clarity, adaptability, and
computational efficiency, underscoring the potential of combining specialized
imitation modules with meta-level orchestration to develop more robust,
general-purpose AI agents.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在结构化资源分配任务中的能力，并解决现有评估方法因数据污染和静态基准而受限的问题。

Method: 采用参与式预算（PB）作为评估框架，测试三种提示策略（贪婪选择、直接优化和启发式优化），并比较LLMs的分配结果与最优解。

Result: 结果表明提示设计对LLMs表现至关重要，LLMs在机制设计和处理非结构化输入方面具有潜力。

Conclusion: LLMs在资源分配和偏好推断任务中表现出潜力，提示设计是关键因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to handle complex
decision-making tasks, yet their ability to perform structured resource
allocation remains underexplored. Evaluating their reasoning is also difficult
due to data contamination and the static nature of existing benchmarks. We
present a dual-purpose framework leveraging Participatory Budgeting (PB) both
as (i) a practical setting for LLM-based resource allocation and (ii) an
adaptive benchmark for evaluating their reasoning capabilities. We task LLMs
with selecting project subsets under feasibility (e.g., budget) constraints via
three prompting strategies: greedy selection, direct optimization, and a
hill-climbing-inspired refinement. We benchmark LLMs' allocations against a
utility-maximizing oracle. Interestingly, we also test whether LLMs can infer
structured preferences from natural-language voter input or metadata, without
explicit votes. By comparing allocations based on inferred preferences to those
from ground-truth votes, we evaluate LLMs' ability to extract preferences from
open-ended input. Our results underscore the role of prompt design and show
that LLMs hold promise for mechanism design with unstructured inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知想象力在人类思维中扮演重要角色，但目前被低估，限制了AI的能力。

Method: 提出语义模型，一种基于概率因果关系的数学模型，能够学习和确保想象上下文的连贯性。

Result: 语义模型能够模拟认知想象力，支持连贯的想象上下文和透明操作。

Conclusion: 认知想象力是AI领域的潜在突破点，语义模型为实现这一目标提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Cognitive imagination is a type of imagination that plays a key role in human
thinking. It is not a ``picture-in-the-head'' imagination. It is a faculty to
mentally visualize coherent and holistic systems of concepts and causal links
that serve as semantic contexts for reasoning, decision making and prediction.
Our position is that the role of cognitive imagination is still greatly
underestimated, and this creates numerous problems and diminishes the current
capabilities of AI. For instance, when reasoning, humans rely on imaginary
contexts to retrieve background info. They also constantly return to the
context for semantic verification that their reasoning is still reasonable.
Thus, reasoning without imagination is blind. This paper is a call for greater
attention to cognitive imagination as the next promising breakthrough in
artificial intelligence. As an instrument for simulating cognitive imagination,
we propose semantic models -- a new approach to mathematical models that can
learn, like neural networks, and are based on probabilistic causal
relationships. Semantic models can simulate cognitive imagination because they
ensure the consistency of imaginary contexts and implement a glass-box approach
that allows the context to be manipulated as a holistic and coherent system of
interrelated facts glued together with causal relations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有方法在未完成搜索时难以快速找到高质量决策树，且缺乏系统性比较，因此需要一种更有效的随时算法。

Method: CA-DL8.5通过模块化设计整合多种启发式和松弛机制，结合DL8.5的高效剪枝和缓存技术，采用基于重启的波束搜索逐步放松剪枝标准。

Result: 实验表明，基于LDS的CA-DL8.5在随时性能上表现最佳，优于其他变体和Blossom算法，同时保持完整性和最优性。

Conclusion: CA-DL8.5为决策树学习提供了通用框架，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Finding an optimal decision tree that minimizes classification error is known
to be NP-hard. While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic
programming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior
-- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the
search is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space
exploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have
been proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not
been systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative
effectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and
anytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some
existing anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous
approaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various
heuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design. The algorithm
reuses DL8.5's efficient branch-and-bound pruning and trie-based caching,
combined with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes pruning
criteria to improve solution quality over time. Our contributions are twofold:
(1) We introduce this new generic framework for exact and anytime decision tree
learning, enabling the incorporation of diverse heuristics and search
strategies; (2) We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of several
instantiations of CA-DL8.5 -- based on Purity, Gain, Discrepancy, and Top-k
heuristics -- using an anytime evaluation metric called the primal gap
integral. Experimental results on standard classification benchmarks show that
CA-DL8.5 using LDS (limited discrepancy) consistently provides the best anytime
performance, outperforming both other CA-DL8.5 variants and the Blossom
algorithm while maintaining completeness and optimality guarantees.

Result: 在CARLA模拟器上的实验表明，ME³-BEV在碰撞率和轨迹精度等多项指标上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: ME³-BEV为实时自动驾驶提供了一种高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in perceiving complex
environments and making real-time decisions. Traditional modular approaches,
while offering interpretability, suffer from error propagation and coordination
issues, whereas end-to-end learning systems can simplify the design but face
computational bottlenecks. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous
driving using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that integrates bird's-eye view
(BEV) perception for enhanced real-time decision-making. We introduce the
\texttt{Mamba-BEV} model, an efficient spatio-temporal feature extraction
network that combines BEV-based perception with the Mamba framework for
temporal feature modeling. This integration allows the system to encode vehicle
surroundings and road features in a unified coordinate system and accurately
model long-range dependencies. Building on this, we propose the
\texttt{ME$^3$-BEV} framework, which utilizes the \texttt{Mamba-BEV} model as a
feature input for end-to-end DRL, achieving superior performance in dynamic
urban driving scenarios. We further enhance the interpretability of the model
by visualizing high-dimensional features through semantic segmentation,
providing insight into the learned representations. Extensive experiments on
the CARLA simulator demonstrate that \texttt{ME$^3$-BEV} outperforms existing
models across multiple metrics, including collision rate and trajectory
accuracy, offering a promising solution for real-time autonomous driving.

Method: 通过理论证明，比较GNNs与C2逻辑的表达能力。

Result: 证明GNNs的逻辑表达能力严格超过C2。

Conclusion: GNNs的表达能力超越C2，同时为无穷逻辑提供新见解。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the
expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) by relating them to logical
languages. This research has been been initialised by an influential result of
Barcel\'o et al. (2020), who showed that the graded modal logic (or a guarded
fragment of the logic C2), characterises the logical expressiveness of
aggregate-combine GNNs. As a ``challenging open problem'' they left the
question whether full C2 characterises the logical expressiveness of
aggregate-combine-readout GNNs. This question has remained unresolved despite
several attempts. In this paper, we solve the above open problem by proving
that the logical expressiveness of aggregate-combine-readout GNNs strictly
exceeds that of C2. This result holds over both undirected and directed graphs.
Beyond its implications for GNNs, our work also leads to purely logical
insights on the expressive power of infinitary logics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决表格推理任务依赖标注数据或复杂数据增强的问题，提升LLM在零样本场景下的表现。

Method: 引入PanelTR框架，利用五种科学家角色进行独立研究、自我审查和协作评审，实现语义级迁移。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，PanelTR优于传统LLM，媲美监督模型，且不依赖训练数据。

Conclusion: 结构化科学方法能有效处理复杂任务，具备零样本场景下的灵活语义理解能力。

Abstract: Table reasoning, including tabular QA and fact verification, often depends on
annotated data or complex data augmentation, limiting flexibility and
generalization. LLMs, despite their versatility, often underperform compared to
simple supervised models. To approach these issues, we introduce PanelTR, a
framework utilizing LLM agent scientists for robust table reasoning through a
structured scientific approach. PanelTR's workflow involves agent scientists
conducting individual investigations, engaging in self-review, and
participating in collaborative peer-review discussions. This process, driven by
five scientist personas, enables semantic-level transfer without relying on
data augmentation or parametric optimization. Experiments across four
benchmarks show that PanelTR outperforms vanilla LLMs and rivals fully
supervised models, all while remaining independent of training data. Our
findings indicate that structured scientific methodology can effectively handle
complex tasks beyond table reasoning with flexible semantic understanding in a
zero-shot context.

TL;DR: SKATE是一种新型评估框架，通过让大型语言模型（LLM）相互生成和解决可验证任务来评估其能力，具有自动化、可扩展和客观性等优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法需要大量领域专业知识，难以适应快速发展的模型，因此需要一种更通用的评估框架。

Method: SKATE框架将评估视为游戏，模型同时作为任务设置者和解决者，通过生成任务来展示自身优势并暴露他人弱点。

Result: 实验证明，SKATE能有效区分模型能力，发现模型自我偏好行为，并揭示模型间的细粒度差异。

Conclusion: SKATE为通用、可扩展的评估框架提供了重要进展，能够跟上LLM的发展步伐。

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities and risks of foundation models is paramount, yet
current methods demand extensive domain expertise, hindering their scalability
as these models rapidly evolve. We introduce SKATE: a novel evaluation
framework in which large language models (LLMs) compete by generating and
solving verifiable tasks for one another. Our core insight is to treat
evaluation as a game: models act as both task-setters and solvers, incentivized
to create questions which highlight their own strengths while exposing others'
weaknesses. SKATE offers several key advantages, balancing scalability,
open-endedness, and objectivity. It is fully automated, data-free, and
scalable, requiring no human input or domain expertise. By using verifiable
tasks rather than LLM judges, scoring is objective. Unlike domain-limited
programmatically-generated benchmarks (e.g. chess-playing or spatial
reasoning), having LLMs creatively pose challenges enables open-ended and
scalable evaluation. As a proof of concept, we introduce LLM-set
code-output-prediction (COP) challenges as a verifiable and extensible
framework in which to test our approach. Using a TrueSkill-based ranking
system, we evaluate six frontier LLMs and find that: (1) weaker models can
reliably differentiate and score stronger ones, (2) LLM-based systems are
capable of self-preferencing behavior, generating questions that align with
their own capabilities, and (3) SKATE automatically surfaces fine-grained
capability differences between models. Our findings are an important step
towards general, scalable evaluation frameworks which can keep pace with LLM
progress.

Result: 特征重要性因模型而异，但某些特征始终是强预测因子；提出了统一框架以量化特征影响。

Conclusion: 特征重要性分析为元启发式算法设计提供了指导机制的基础。

Abstract: The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a complex optimization problem with
numerous real-world applications, mostly solved using metaheuristic algorithms
due to its $\mathcal{NP}$-Hard nature. Traditionally, these metaheuristics rely
on human-crafted designs developed through empirical studies. However, recent
research shows that machine learning methods can be used the structural
characteristics of solutions in combinatorial optimization, thereby aiding in
designing more efficient algorithms, particularly for solving VRP. Building on
this advancement, this study extends the previous research by conducting a
sensitivity analysis using multiple classifier models that are capable of
predicting the quality of VRP solutions. Hence, by leveraging explainable AI,
this research is able to extend the understanding of how these models make
decisions. Finally, our findings indicate that while feature importance varies,
certain features consistently emerge as strong predictors. Furthermore, we
propose a unified framework able of ranking feature impact across different
scenarios to illustrate this finding. These insights highlight the potential of
feature importance analysis as a foundation for developing a guidance mechanism
of metaheuristic algorithms for solving the VRP.

Method: 使用OpenAI的GPT-4o-mini作为基础模型，结合text-embedding-3-small模型和Langchain工具，构建了一个混合检索系统，并利用公共数据库中的药物使用审查（DUR）数据。

Result: RAG框架显著提升了模型准确性，年龄组、妊娠和联合用药的准确率分别达到0.94、0.87和0.89。

Conclusion: 通过RAG框架增强LLMs，可以有效减少处方和用药决策中的不确定性，提供更精确的药物禁忌信息。

Abstract: The versatility of large language models (LLMs) has been explored across
various sectors, but their application in healthcare poses challenges,
particularly in the domain of pharmaceutical contraindications where accurate
and reliable information is required. This study enhances the capability of
LLMs to address contraindications effectively by implementing a Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini as the base
model, and the text-embedding-3-small model for embeddings, our approach
integrates Langchain to orchestrate a hybrid retrieval system with re-ranking.
This system leverages Drug Utilization Review (DUR) data from public databases,
focusing on contraindications for specific age groups, pregnancy, and
concomitant drug use. The dataset includes 300 question-answer pairs across
three categories, with baseline model accuracy ranging from 0.49 to 0.57.
Post-integration of the RAG pipeline, we observed a significant improvement in
model accuracy, achieving rates of 0.94, 0.87, and 0.89 for contraindications
related to age groups, pregnancy, and concomitant drug use, respectively. The
results indicate that augmenting LLMs with a RAG framework can substantially
reduce uncertainty in prescription and drug intake decisions by providing more
precise and reliable drug contraindication information.

Conclusion: 置信度驱动的评估方法能显著提升LLM作为评判者的可靠性和适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as automated judges, where
practical value depends on both accuracy and trustworthy, risk-aware judgments.
Existing approaches predominantly focus on accuracy, overlooking the necessity
of well-calibrated confidence, which is vital for adaptive and reliable
evaluation pipelines. In this work, we advocate a shift from accuracy-centric
evaluation to confidence-driven, risk-aware LLM-as-a-Judge systems, emphasizing
the necessity of well-calibrated confidence for trustworthy and adaptive
evaluation. We systematically identify the **Overconfidence Phenomenon** in
current LLM-as-a-Judges, where predicted confidence significantly overstates
actual correctness, undermining reliability in practical deployment. To
quantify this phenomenon, we introduce **TH-Score**, a novel metric measuring
confidence-accuracy alignment. Furthermore, we propose **LLM-as-a-Fuser**, an
ensemble framework that transforms LLMs into reliable, risk-aware evaluators.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves
calibration and enables adaptive, confidence-driven evaluation pipelines,
achieving superior reliability and accuracy compared to existing baselines.

Motivation: 现有基准未能充分评估 MLLM 在几何问题中的长步推理和辅助线构造能力，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 构建 GeoLaux 数据集，包含计算和证明问题，设计五维评估策略（答案正确性、过程正确性、过程质量、辅助线影响和错误原因）。

Result: 实验显示 MLLM 在长步推理中性能显著下降，证明问题中倾向于走捷径，且缺乏辅助线意识。

Conclusion: GeoLaux 可作为评估 MLLM 几何推理能力的基准，并指导模型能力提升。

Abstract: Geometry problem solving (GPS) requires models to master diagram
comprehension, logical reasoning, knowledge application, numerical computation,
and auxiliary line construction. This presents a significant challenge for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks for
evaluating MLLM geometry skills overlook auxiliary line construction and lack
fine-grained process evaluation, making them insufficient for assessing MLLMs'
long-step reasoning abilities. To bridge these gaps, we present the GeoLaux
benchmark, comprising 2,186 geometry problems, incorporating both calculation
and proving questions. Notably, the problems require an average of 6.51
reasoning steps, with a maximum of 24 steps, and 41.8% of them need auxiliary
line construction. Building on the dataset, we design a novel five-dimensional
evaluation strategy assessing answer correctness, process correctness, process
quality, auxiliary line impact, and error causes. Extensive experiments on 13
leading MLLMs (including thinking models and non-thinking models) yield three
pivotal findings: First, models exhibit substantial performance degradation in
extended reasoning steps (nine models demonstrate over 50% performance drop).
Second, compared to calculation problems, MLLMs tend to take shortcuts when
solving proving problems. Third, models lack auxiliary line awareness, and
enhancing this capability proves particularly beneficial for overall geometry
reasoning improvement. These findings establish GeoLaux as both a benchmark for
evaluating MLLMs' long-step geometric reasoning with auxiliary lines and a
guide for capability advancement. Our dataset and code are included in
supplementary materials and will be released.

Abstract: The goal of inductive logic programming is to search for a hypothesis that
generalises training data and background knowledge. The challenge is searching
vast hypothesis spaces, which is exacerbated because many logically equivalent
hypotheses exist. To address this challenge, we introduce a method to break
symmetries in the hypothesis space. We implement our idea in answer set
programming. Our experiments on multiple domains, including visual reasoning
and game playing, show that our approach can reduce solving times from over an
hour to just 17 seconds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估和提升大型语言模型（LLM）的鲁棒性，特别是在对抗攻击下的表现。

Method: 使用PRISM Eval Behavior Elicitation Tool (BET)进行自动化红队测试，通过动态对抗优化攻击41个LLM。

Result: BET对37个LLM实现100%攻击成功率，攻击难度差异达300倍以上。

Conclusion: 提出了分布式鲁棒性评估的实用路径，并展示了模型在对抗攻击下的普遍脆弱性。

Abstract: This technical report accompanies the LLM robustness leaderboard published by
PRISM Eval for the Paris AI Action Summit. We introduce PRISM Eval Behavior
Elicitation Tool (BET), an AI system performing automated red-teaming through
Dynamic Adversarial Optimization that achieves 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR)
against 37 of 41 state-of-the-art LLMs. Beyond binary success metrics, we
propose a fine-grained robustness metric estimating the average number of
attempts required to elicit harmful behaviors, revealing that attack difficulty
varies by over 300-fold across models despite universal vulnerability. We
introduce primitive-level vulnerability analysis to identify which jailbreaking
techniques are most effective for specific hazard categories. Our collaborative
evaluation with trusted third parties from the AI Safety Network demonstrates
practical pathways for distributed robustness assessment across the community.

### [190] [A "good regulator theorem" for embodied agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06326)
*Nathaniel Virgo,Martin Biehl,Manuel Baltieri,Matteo Capucci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了Conant和Ashby的定理在现代系统中的适用性，提出了一种更广义的“信念更新”模型概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conant和Ashby的定理在人工生命等领域中似乎不适用，作者试图找到一种更普适的理论框架。

Method: 通过引入“信念更新”的概念，将模型解释为外部观察者对系统的理解。

Result: 提出了一种更广义的模型定义，适用于多种系统，包括经典控制理论和内部状态调节。

Conclusion: 模型的本质是外部观察者的解释，而非系统固有属性，这解决了原有定理的局限性。

Abstract: In a classic paper, Conant and Ashby claimed that "every good regulator of a
system must be a model of that system." Artificial Life has produced many
examples of systems that perform tasks with apparently no model in sight; these
suggest Conant and Ashby's theorem doesn't easily generalise beyond its
restricted setup. Nevertheless, here we show that a similar intuition can be
fleshed out in a different way: whenever an agent is able to perform a
regulation task, it is possible for an observer to interpret it as having
"beliefs" about its environment, which it "updates" in response to sensory
input. This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more
sophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more
broadly applicable. However, it necessitates a change in perspective, in that
the observer plays an essential role in the theory: models are not a mere
property of the system but are imposed on it from outside. Our theorem holds
regardless of whether the system is regulating its environment in a classic
control theory setup, or whether it's regulating its own internal state; the
model is of its environment either way. The model might be trivial, however,
and this is how the apparent counterexamples are resolved.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的机器学习模型AntiCheatPT_256，用于检测《CS2》中的作弊行为，并公开了标注数据集CS2CD。模型在测试集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线游戏中的作弊行为破坏了游戏体验，现有反作弊系统难以在不侵入用户系统的情况下应对不断演变的作弊手段。

Method: 使用Transformer模型分析游戏数据，并引入公开数据集CS2CD（795场比赛），生成并增强90,707个上下文窗口以解决类别不平衡问题。

Result: 模型在未增强测试集上达到89.17%的准确率和93.36%的AUC。

Conclusion: 该方法强调可重复性和实际应用性，为数据驱动的作弊检测研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Cheating in online video games compromises the integrity of gaming
experiences. Anti-cheat systems, such as VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat), face
significant challenges in keeping pace with evolving cheating methods without
imposing invasive measures on users' systems. This paper presents
AntiCheatPT\_256, a transformer-based machine learning model designed to detect
cheating behaviour in Counter-Strike 2 using gameplay data. To support this, we
introduce and publicly release CS2CD: A labelled dataset of 795 matches. Using
this dataset, 90,707 context windows were created and subsequently augmented to
address class imbalance. The transformer model, trained on these windows,
achieved an accuracy of 89.17\% and an AUC of 93.36\% on an unaugmented test
set. This approach emphasizes reproducibility and real-world applicability,
offering a robust baseline for future research in data-driven cheat detection.

*Christian Meske,Justin Brenne,Erdi Uenal,Sabahat Oelcer,Ayseguel Doganguen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出“解释性AI”作为补充范式，利用生成式AI能力作为人类理解的解释伙伴，而非算法透明性的提供者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可解释AI（XAI）方法过于抽象且非自适应，难以支持终端用户的理解。

Method: 提出八维概念模型，强调叙事沟通、自适应个性化和渐进披露原则，并通过快速情境设计方法进行实证验证。

Result: 用户更偏好情境敏感的多模态解释，而非技术透明性。

Conclusion: AI系统应设计为人类理解服务，而非算法内省，为跨领域和文化背景的用户中心解释方法提供研究议程。

Abstract: Current explainable AI (XAI) approaches prioritize algorithmic transparency
and present explanations in abstract, non-adaptive formats that often fail to
support meaningful end-user understanding. This paper introduces "Explanatory
AI" as a complementary paradigm that leverages generative AI capabilities to
serve as explanatory partners for human understanding rather than providers of
algorithmic transparency. While XAI reveals algorithmic decision processes for
model validation, Explanatory AI addresses contextual reasoning to support
human decision-making in sociotechnical contexts. We develop a definition and
systematic eight-dimensional conceptual model distinguishing Explanatory AI
through narrative communication, adaptive personalization, and progressive
disclosure principles. Empirical validation through Rapid Contextual Design
methodology with healthcare professionals demonstrates that users consistently
prefer context-sensitive, multimodal explanations over technical transparency.
Our findings reveal the practical urgency for AI systems designed for human
comprehension rather than algorithmic introspection, establishing a
comprehensive research agenda for advancing user-centered AI explanation
approaches across diverse domains and cultural contexts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出两种构建法律知识图谱的方法，填补法律领域知识图谱的空白，并验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律决策需要全面的立法背景知识和最新的法律案例信息，但目前法律领域的知识图谱较少。

Method: 采用两种互补方法：系统化的自底向上方法和基于大型语言模型的新方法，结合结构化数据提取、本体开发和语义丰富。

Result: 构建了针对暴力侵害妇女法律案例的知识图谱，并通过能力问题验证其有效性。

Conclusion: 该知识图谱可提升法律信息的可访问性，支持复杂查询，并为预测性司法机器学习工具提供知识支持。

Abstract: Legal decision-making process requires the availability of comprehensive and
detailed legislative background knowledge and up-to-date information on legal
cases and related sentences/decisions. Legal Knowledge Graphs (KGs) would be a
valuable tool to facilitate access to legal information, to be queried and
exploited for the purpose, and to enable advanced reasoning and machine
learning applications. Indeed, legal KGs may act as knowledge intensive
component to be used by pre-dictive machine learning solutions supporting the
decision process of the legal expert. Nevertheless, a few KGs can be found in
the legal domain. To fill this gap, we developed a legal KG targeting legal
cases of violence against women, along with clear adopted methodologies.
Specifically, the paper introduces two complementary approaches for automated
legal KG construction; a systematic bottom-up approach, customized for the
legal domain, and a new solution leveraging Large Language Models. Starting
from legal sentences publicly available from the European Court of Justice, the
solutions integrate structured data extraction, ontology development, and
semantic enrichment to produce KGs tailored for legal cases involving violence
against women. After analyzing and comparing the results of the two approaches,
the developed KGs are validated via suitable competency questions. The obtained
KG may be impactful for multiple purposes: can improve the accessibility to
legal information both to humans and machine, can enable complex queries and
may constitute an important knowledge component to be possibly exploited by
machine learning tools tailored for predictive justice.

*Debabrota Basu,Udvas Das*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态机制“Fair Game”，通过结合审计员和去偏算法，利用强化学习实现机器学习算法的公平性，并适应社会动态变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前公平机器学习的定义多为观察性，且存在冲突，无法动态适应社会环境变化，因此需要一种新机制来弥合这一差距。

Method: 提出“Fair Game”框架，将审计员和去偏算法通过强化学习结合，动态调整公平目标。

Result: “Fair Game”能够灵活适应社会伦理和法律框架的变化，为公平机器学习提供动态解决方案。

Conclusion: “Fair Game”为公平机器学习提供了动态、灵活的框架，适用于部署前和部署后的场景。

Abstract: An emerging field of AI, namely Fair Machine Learning (ML), aims to quantify
different types of bias (also known as unfairness) exhibited in the predictions
of ML algorithms, and to design new algorithms to mitigate them. Often, the
definitions of bias used in the literature are observational, i.e. they use the
input and output of a pre-trained algorithm to quantify a bias under concern.
In reality,these definitions are often conflicting in nature and can only be
deployed if either the ground truth is known or only in retrospect after
deploying the algorithm. Thus,there is a gap between what we want Fair ML to
achieve and what it does in a dynamic social environment. Hence, we propose an
alternative dynamic mechanism,"Fair Game",to assure fairness in the predictions
of an ML algorithm and to adapt its predictions as the society interacts with
the algorithm over time. "Fair Game" puts together an Auditor and a Debiasing
algorithm in a loop around an ML algorithm. The "Fair Game" puts these two
components in a loop by leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL algorithms
interact with an environment to take decisions, which yields new observations
(also known as data/feedback) from the environment and in turn, adapts future
decisions. RL is already used in algorithms with pre-fixed long-term fairness
goals. "Fair Game" provides a unique framework where the fairness goals can be
adapted over time by only modifying the auditor and the different biases it
quantifies. Thus,"Fair Game" aims to simulate the evolution of ethical and
legal frameworks in the society by creating an auditor which sends feedback to
a debiasing algorithm deployed around an ML system. This allows us to develop a
flexible and adaptive-over-time framework to build Fair ML systems pre- and
post-deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多赢家投票规则在实际应用中的公理表现，弥补最坏情况分析的不足。

Method: 提出数据驱动框架，分析不同偏好分布下投票规则的公理表现，并引入神经网络优化。

Result: 神经网络作为投票规则在减少公理违反上优于传统规则。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法可为投票系统设计提供新思路，支持社会选择领域的持续研究。

Abstract: Committee-selection problems arise in many contexts and applications, and
there has been increasing interest within the social choice research community
on identifying which properties are satisfied by different multi-winner voting
rules. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework to evaluate how
frequently voting rules violate axioms across diverse preference distributions
in practice, shifting away from the binary perspective of axiom satisfaction
given by worst-case analysis. Using this framework, we analyze the relationship
between multi-winner voting rules and their axiomatic performance under several
preference distributions. We then show that neural networks, acting as voting
rules, can outperform traditional rules in minimizing axiom violations. Our
results suggest that data-driven approaches to social choice can inform the
design of new voting systems and support the continuation of data-driven
research in social choice.

TL;DR: DogFit方法通过领域感知的微调机制，在扩散模型迁移学习中实现了高效的可控性改进，减少了计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在小目标域上的迁移学习存在泛化性差的问题，现有方法计算成本高。

Method: 提出Domain-guided Fine-tuning (DogFit)，通过领域感知的指导偏移和轻量级条件机制，优化训练和推理过程。

Result: 在多个目标域上，DogFit在FID和FDDINOV2指标上优于现有方法，计算开销减少50%。

Conclusion: DogFit为扩散模型迁移学习提供了一种高效可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Transfer learning of diffusion models to smaller target domains is
challenging, as naively fine-tuning the model often results in poor
generalization. Test-time guidance methods help mitigate this by offering
controllable improvements in image fidelity through a trade-off with sample
diversity. However, this benefit comes at a high computational cost, typically
requiring dual forward passes during sampling. We propose the Domain-guided
Fine-tuning (DogFit) method, an effective guidance mechanism for diffusion
transfer learning that maintains controllability without incurring additional
computational overhead. DogFit injects a domain-aware guidance offset into the
training loss, effectively internalizing the guided behavior during the
fine-tuning process. The domain-aware design is motivated by our observation
that during fine-tuning, the unconditional source model offers a stronger
marginal estimate than the target model. To support efficient controllable
fidelity-diversity trade-offs at inference, we encode the guidance strength
value as an additional model input through a lightweight conditioning
mechanism. We further investigate the optimal placement and timing of the
guidance offset during training and propose two simple scheduling strategies,
i.e., late-start and cut-off, which improve generation quality and training
stability. Experiments on DiT and SiT backbones across six diverse target
domains show that DogFit can outperform prior guidance methods in transfer
learning in terms of FID and FDDINOV2 while requiring up to 2x fewer sampling
TFLOPS.

Conclusion: 该方法为草显示颜色变化的快速模拟提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on incorporating media into living environments
via color-controlled materials and image display. In particular, grass-based
displays have drawn attention as landscape-friendly interactive interfaces. To
develop the grass display, it is important to obtain the grass color change
characteristics that depend on the real environment. However, conventional
methods require experiments on actual equipment every time the lighting or
viewpoint changes, which is time-consuming and costly. Although research has
begun on simulating grass colors, this approach still faces significant issues
as it takes many hours for a single measurement. In this paper, we explore an
interactive simulation of a grass display color change characteristic based on
real-world conditions in a virtual environment. We evaluated our method's
accuracy by simulating grass color characteristics across multiple viewpoints
and environments, and then compared the results against prior work. The results
indicated that our method tended to simulate the grass color characteristics
similar to the actual characteristics and showed the potential to do so more
quickly and with comparable accuracy to the previous study.
