This study introduces an empirical learning framework that derives these trade-offs directly from naturalistic trajectory data. A unified objective space represents each AV timestep through composite scores of safety, efficiency, and interaction. Pareto dominance is applied to identify non-dominated states, forming an empirical frontier that defines the attainable region of balanced performance.\n  The proposed framework was demonstrated using the Third Generation Simulation (TGSIM) datasets from Foggy Bottom and I-395. Results showed that only 0.23\\% of AV driving instances were Pareto-optimal, underscoring the rarity of simultaneous optimization across objectives. Pareto-optimal states showed notably higher mean scores for safety, efficiency, and interaction compared to non-optimal cases, with interaction showing the greatest potential for improvement.\n  This minimally invasive and modular framework, which requires only kinematic and positional data, can be directly applied beyond the scope of this study to derive and visualize multi-objective learning surfaces", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6743\u8861\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u8bc6\u522b\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u8981\u5e73\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7528\u590d\u5408\u5206\u6570\u8868\u793a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u652f\u914d\u8bc6\u522b\u975e\u652f\u914d\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7ecf\u9a8c\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "result": "\u4ec50.23%\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8fbe\u5230\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u72b6\u6001\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u975e\u6700\u4f18\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4ea4\u4e92\u6539\u5584\u6f5c\u529b\u6700\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4ec5\u9700\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5c0f\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002"}}

Despite this, representation learning for depth modality remains underexplored compared to RGB, where large-scale foundation models now define the state of the art. To address this gap, we present DeFM, a self-supervised foundation model trained entirely on depth images for robotic applications. Using a DINO-style self-distillation objective on a curated dataset of 60M depth images, DeFM learns geometric and semantic representations that generalize to diverse environments, tasks, and sensors. To retain metric awareness across multiple scales, we introduce a novel input normalization strategy. We further distill DeFM into compact models suitable for resource-constrained robotic systems. When evaluated on depth-based classification, segmentation, navigation, locomotion, and manipulation benchmarks, DeFM achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong generalization from simulation to real-world environments. We release all our pretrained models, which can be adopted off-the-shelf for depth-based robotic learning without task-specific fine-tuning.

The platform integrates whole-body control, manipulation with integrated grippers, and virtual-reality-based teleoperation within a unified hardware-software stack. An expressive head further enables social interaction -- a domain that remains underexplored on most utilitarian humanoids.

During operation, for various reasons, the robot might find itself on a collision course with an obstacle in its environment. In this paper, a switching Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) strategy is proposed to safely handle collisions for an Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System (UVMS). When avoiding the collision is impossible, the control algorithm takes advantage of the manipulator, using it to push against the obstacle, and deflect away from the collision. Virtual experiments are performed to demonstrate the algorithm's capability to successfully detect collisions and either avoid them, or use the manipulator to handle them appropriately without damaging sensitive areas of the vehicle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5207\u6362\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6c34\u4e0b\u8f66\u8f86-\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u78b0\u649e\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u907f\u514d\u78b0\u649e\u548c\u5229\u7528\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u63a8\u79bb\u969c\u788d\u7269", "motivation": "\u6c34\u4e0b\u81ea\u4e3b\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u9762\u4e34\u4e0e\u969c\u788d\u7269\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5b89\u5168\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u8f66\u8f86\u654f\u611f\u533a\u57df", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5207\u6362\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f53\u65e0\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u78b0\u649e\u65f6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u63a8\u538b\u969c\u788d\u7269\u5b9e\u73b0\u504f\u8f6c\u907f\u78b0", "result": "\u865a\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u68c0\u6d4b\u78b0\u649e\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u907f\u514d\u78b0\u649e\u6216\u5229\u7528\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u9002\u5f53\u5904\u7406\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u574f\u8f66\u8f86\u654f\u611f\u533a\u57df", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6c34\u4e0b\u8f66\u8f86-\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6c34\u4e0b\u5e72\u9884\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027"}}

Vision-based alternatives often require substantial computation, introduce latency, and degrade in real-world conditions. In this work, we present a high accuracy, real-time pipeline for continuous Braille recognition using Evetac, an open-source neuromorphic event-based tactile sensor. Unlike frame-based vision systems, the neuromorphic tactile modality directly encodes dynamic contact events during continuous sliding, closely emulating human finger-scanning strategies. Our approach combines spatiotemporal segmentation with a lightweight ResNet-based classifier to process sparse event streams, enabling robust character recognition across varying indentation depths and scanning speeds. The proposed system achieves near-perfect accuracy (>=98%) at standard depths, generalizes across multiple Braille board layouts, and maintains strong performance under fast scanning. On a physical Braille board containing daily-living vocabulary, the system attains over 90% word-level accuracy, demonstrating robustness to temporal compression effects that challenge conventional methods.

Our extensive analysis of ten causal and six masked language models reveals that most models, especially those pre-trained with the masking objective, are overconfident.

Submitted to Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization", "summary": "Soft robotic grippers are essential for grasping delicate, geometrically complex objects in manufacturing, healthcare and agriculture. However, existing grippers struggle to grasp feature-rich objects with high topological variability, including gears with sharp tooth profiles on automotive assembly lines, corals with fragile protrusions, or vegetables with irregular branching structures like broccoli. Unlike simple geometric primitives such as cubes or spheres, feature-rich objects lack a clear \"optimal\" contact surface, making them both difficult to grasp and susceptible to damage when grasped by existing gripper designs. Safe handling of such objects therefore requires specialized soft grippers whose morphology is tailored to the object's features. Topology optimization offers a promising approach for producing specialized grippers, but its utility is limited by the requirement for pre-defined load cases. For soft grippers interacting with feature-rich objects, these loads arise from hundreds of unpredictable gripper-object contact forces during grasping and are unknown a priori. To address this problem, we introduce SimTO, a framework that enables high-resolution topology optimization by automatically extracting load cases from a contact-based physics simulator, eliminating the need for manual load specification. Given an arbitrary feature-rich object, SimTO produces highly customized soft grippers with fine-grained morphological features tailored to the object geometry. Numerical results show our designs are not only highly specialized to feature-rich objects, but also generalize to unseen objects.", "AI": {"tldr": "SimTO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u8d1f\u8f7d\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u62d3\u6251\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u4e30\u5bcc\u7269\u4f53\u5b9a\u5236\u8f6f\u4f53\u5939\u722a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u6307\u5b9a\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f6f\u4f53\u5939\u722a\u96be\u4ee5\u6293\u53d6\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4e30\u5bcc\u7269\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u9f7f\u8f6e\u3001\u73ca\u745a\u3001\u897f\u5170\u82b1\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7269\u4f53\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\"\u6700\u4f18\"\u63a5\u89e6\u8868\u9762\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u635f\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u62d3\u6251\u4f18\u5316\u9700\u8981\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u8d1f\u8f7d\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4f46\u8f6f\u4f53\u5939\u722a\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u4e30\u5bcc\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u6570\u767e\u79cd\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSimTO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u8d1f\u8f7d\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u62d3\u6251\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4efb\u610f\u7279\u5f81\u4e30\u5bcc\u7269\u4f53\uff0cSimTO\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u8f6f\u4f53\u5939\u722a\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cSimTO\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5939\u722a\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5bf9\u7279\u5f81\u4e30\u5bcc\u7269\u4f53\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e13\u4e00\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "SimTO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u8d1f\u8f7d\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u62d3\u6251\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u8f6f\u4f53\u5939\u722a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u4e30\u5bcc\u7269\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684\u8f6f\u4f53\u5939\u722a\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We approach this problem from a data-centric perspective, finding that not all training samples contribute equally to the SD acceptance rate. Specifically, our theoretical analysis and empirical validation reveals that tokens inducing flatter predictive distributions from the target model are more valuable than those yielding sharply peaked distributions. Based on this insight, we propose flatness, a new metric to quantify this property, and develop the Sample-level-flatness-based Dataset Distillation (SFDD) approach, which filters the training data to retain only the most valuable samples. Experiments on the EAGLE framework demonstrate that SFDD can achieve over 2$\\times$ training speedup using only 50% of the data, while keeping the final model's inference speedup within 4% of the full-dataset baseline.

This work has been accepted for publication in the Proceedings of IEEE SYSCON 2026", "summary": "Robots sometimes have to work together with a mixture of partially-aligned or conflicting goals. Flocking - coordinated motion through cohesion, alignment, and separation - traditionally assumes uniform desired inter-agent distances. Many practical applications demand greater flexibility, as the diversity of types and configurations grows with the popularity of multi-agent systems in society. Moreover, agents often operate without guarantees of trust or secure communication. Motivated by these challenges we update well-established frameworks by relaxing this assumption of shared inter-agent distances and constraints. Through a new form of constrained collective potential function, we introduce a solution that permits negotiation of these parameters. In the spirit of the traditional flocking control canon, this negotiation is achieved purely through local observations and does not require any global information or inter-agent communication. The approach is robust to semi-trust scenarios, where neighbouring agents pursue conflicting goals. We validate the effectiveness of the approach through a series of simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u89c2\u5bdf\u534f\u5546\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u671f\u671b\u95f4\u8ddd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u534a\u4fe1\u4efb\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7fa4\u4f53\u63a7\u5236\u5047\u8bbe\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u671f\u671b\u95f4\u8ddd\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u591a\u6837\uff0c\u4e14\u5e38\u5e38\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u4fe1\u4efb\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6216\u5b89\u5168\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u96c6\u4f53\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u5546\u95f4\u8ddd\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u89c2\u5bdf\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u534a\u4fe1\u4efb\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u66f4\u65b0\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7fa4\u4f53\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5141\u8bb8\u95f4\u8ddd\u53c2\u6570\u534f\u5546\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u534a\u4fe1\u4efb\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

These assumptions are mismatched to baby language models trained on developmentally plausible input such as child-directed speech and early-childhood narratives, and they obscure which reasoning abilities (if any) emerge under such constraints. We introduce BabyReasoningBench, a GPT-5.2 generated benchmark of 19 reasoning tasks grounded in classic paradigms from developmental psychology, spanning theory of mind, analogical and relational reasoning, causal inference and intervention selection, and core reasoning primitives that are known to be confounded by memory and pragmatics. We find that two GPT-2 based baby language models (pretrained on 10M and 100M of child-directed speech text) show overall low but uneven performance, with dissociations across task families: scaling improves several causal and physical reasoning tasks, while belief attribution and pragmatics-sensitive tasks remain challenging. BabyReasoningBench provides a developmentally grounded lens for analyzing what kinds of reasoning are supported by child-like training distributions, and for testing mechanistic hypotheses about how such abilities emerge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86BabyReasoningBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u513f\u7ae5\u53d1\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\"\u5a74\u513f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\"\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u8bed\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6210\u4eba\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u548c\u6210\u719f\u7684\u8bed\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0e\u5728\u513f\u7ae5\u53d1\u5c55\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u513f\u7ae5\u5bfc\u5411\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u7ae5\u5e74\u53d9\u4e8b\uff09\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\"\u5a74\u513f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\"\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u54ea\u4e9b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u80fd\u591f\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5f15\u5165\u4e86BabyReasoningBench\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eGPT-5.2\u751f\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b19\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u6839\u690d\u4e8e\u53d1\u5c55\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u7c7b\u6bd4\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5df2\u77e5\u53d7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u8bed\u7528\u6df7\u6dc6\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u63a8\u7406\u539f\u8bed\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eGPT-2\u7684\u5a74\u513f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u57281000\u4e07\u548c1\u4ebf\u4e2a\u513f\u7ae5\u5bfc\u5411\u8bed\u97f3\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u4f4e\u4f46\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u79bb\uff1a\u6269\u5c55\u89c4\u6a21\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u56e0\u679c\u548c\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u800c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u8bed\u7528\u654f\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "BabyReasoningBench\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d1\u5c55\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u513f\u7ae5\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u652f\u6301\u54ea\u4e9b\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5173\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u80fd\u529b\u5982\u4f55\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u673a\u5236\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

It considers a 2D grid-based storage for uniform-sized loads (e.g., containers, pallets, or totes), which are moved by a robot (or other manipulator) along a collision-free path in the grid. The loads are labeled (i.e., unique) and must be stored in a given sequence, and later be retrieved in a different sequence -- an operational pattern that arises in logistics applications, such as last-mile distribution centers and shipyards. The objective is to minimize the load relocations to ensure efficient retrieval. A previous result guarantees a zero-relocation solution for known storage and retrieval sequences, even for storage at full capacity, provided that the side of the grid through which loads are stored/retrieved is at least 3 cells wide. However, in practice, the retrieval sequence can change after the storage phase. To address such uncertainty, this work investigates \\emph{$k$-bounded perturbations} during retrieval, under which any two loads may depart out of order if they are originally at most $k$ positions apart. We prove that a $\u0398(k)$ grid width is necessary and sufficient for eliminating relocations at maximum capacity. We also provide an efficient solver for computing a storage arrangement that is robust to such perturbations. To address the higher-uncertainty case where perturbations exceed $k$, a strategy is introduced to effectively minimize relocations. Extensive experiments show that, for $k$ up to half the grid width, the proposed storage-retrieval framework essentially eliminates relocations. For $k$ values up to the full grid width, relocations are reduced by $50\\%+$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f51\u683c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u5e03\u5c40\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7269\u6d41\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff08\u5982\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u516c\u91cc\u914d\u9001\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u8239\u5382\uff09\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u5e8f\u5217\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u5b58\u50a8\u9636\u6bb5\u540e\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u9700\u8981\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76k\u6709\u754c\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u68c0\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u0398(k)\u7f51\u683c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u662f\u6d88\u9664\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u8d85\u51fak\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5f53k\u8fbe\u5230\u7f51\u683c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e00\u534a\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u672c\u6d88\u9664\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff1b\u5f53k\u8fbe\u5230\u5168\u7f51\u683c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u65f6\uff0c\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51cf\u5c1150%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f51\u683c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u751a\u81f3\u6d88\u9664\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases. We hope these insights motivate further research into program termination and the broader potential of LLMs for reasoning about undecidable problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ec8\u6b62\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cGPT-5\u548cClaude Sonnet-4.5\u63a5\u8fd1SV-Comp 2025\u9876\u7ea7\u5de5\u5177\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u8bc1\u660e\u89c1\u8bc1\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u7a0b\u5e8f\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u7075\u505c\u673a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u5224\u5b9a\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u4f20\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u53ea\u80fd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5904\u7406\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ec8\u6b62\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u968f\u7740LLMs\u7684\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u63a2\u7d22LLMs\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ec8\u6b62\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caLLMs\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u5224\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56fd\u9645\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ade\u8d5b(SV-Comp) 2025\u7ec8\u6b62\u6027\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316C\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u4e2aLLMs\uff08\u5305\u62ecGPT-5\u3001Claude Sonnet-4.5\u548cCode World Model\uff09\u5728\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ec8\u6b62\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ec8\u6b62\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff1aGPT-5\u548cClaude Sonnet-4.5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4ec5\u6b21\u4e8e\u6392\u540d\u7b2c\u4e00\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\uff09\uff0cCode World Model\u4ec5\u6b21\u4e8e\u6392\u540d\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u4f46LLMs\u901a\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\u89c1\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u7a0b\u5e8f\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ec8\u6b62\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u5224\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bc1\u660e\u89c1\u8bc1\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u5728\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ec8\u6b62\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u5224\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u52a8\u529b\u3002"}}

However, little attention has been given to the possibility that such models could be exploited to produce harmful research by repurposing open science artefacts for malicious ends. We fill the gap by introducing an end-to-end pipeline that first bypasses LLM safeguards through persuasion-based jailbreaking, then reinterprets NLP papers to identify and repurpose their artefacts (datasets, methods, and tools) by exploiting their vulnerabilities, and finally assesses the safety of these proposals using our evaluation framework across three dimensions: harmfulness, feasibility of misuse, and soundness of technicality. Overall, our findings demonstrate that LLMs can generate harmful proposals by repurposing ethically designed open artefacts; however, we find that LLMs acting as evaluators strongly disagree with one another on evaluation outcomes: GPT-4.1 assigns higher scores (indicating greater potential harms, higher soundness and feasibility of misuse), Gemini-2.5-pro is markedly stricter, and Grok-3 falls between these extremes.

The soft wrist allows safe contact exploration during data collection, while tactile memory reuses past demonstrations via retrieval for flexible adaptation to unseen scenarios. The core of this system is the Masked Tactile Trajectory Transformer (MAT$^\\text{3}$), which jointly models spatiotemporal interactions between robot actions, distributed tactile feedback, force-torque measurements, and proprioceptive signals. Through masked-token prediction, MAT$^\\text{3}$ learns rich spatiotemporal representations by inferring missing sensory information from context, autonomously extracting task-relevant features without explicit subtask segmentation.

Unlike traditional approaches, FROST leverages attention weights to prune uncritical reasoning paths, yielding shorter and more reliable reasoning trajectories. Methodologically, we introduce the concept of reasoning outliers and design an attention-based mechanism to remove them. Theoretically, FROST preserves and enhances the model's reasoning capacity while eliminating outliers at the sentence level. Empirically, we validate FROST on four benchmarks using two strong reasoning models (Phi-4-Reasoning and GPT-OSS-20B), outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as TALE and ThinkLess. Notably, FROST achieves an average 69.68% reduction in token usage and a 26.70% improvement in accuracy over the base model.

Existing tracking methods optimize for prediction accuracy but ignore pursuit feasibility, resulting in trajectories that are physically impossible to intercept 99.9% of the time. We propose Perception-to-Pursuit (P2P), a track-centric temporal reasoning framework that bridges detection and actionable pursuit planning. Our method represents drone motion as compact 8-dimensional tokens capturing velocity, acceleration, scale, and smoothness, enabling a 12-frame causal transformer to reason about future behavior. We introduce the Intercept Success Rate (ISR) metric to measure pursuit feasibility under realistic interceptor constraints. Evaluated on the Anti-UAV-RGBT dataset with 226 real drone sequences, P2P achieves 28.12 pixel average displacement error and 0.597 ISR, representing a 77% improvement in trajectory prediction and 597x improvement in pursuit feasibility over tracking-only baselines, while maintaining perfect drone classification accuracy (100%).

Such setups overlook the multi-dimensional and multi-modal nature of conversational quality, which encompasses semantic coherence, audio naturalness, speaker consistency, emotion alignment, and turn-taking behavior. Moreover, they are fundamentally mismatched with duplex spoken dialogue systems that generate responses incrementally, where agents must make decisions based on partial utterances. We address these limitations with the first multi-reward RLAIF framework for SDS, combining semantic, audio-quality, and emotion-consistency rewards. To align utterance-level preferences with incremental, blockwise decoding in duplex models, we apply turn-level preference sampling and aggregate per-block log-probabilities within a single DPO objective. We present the first systematic study of preference learning for improving SDS quality in both multi-turn Chain-of-Thought and blockwise duplex models, and release a multi-reward DPO dataset to support reproducible research. Experiments show that single-reward RLAIF selectively improves its targeted metric, while joint multi-reward training yields consistent gains across semantic quality and audio naturalness.

Traditional solvers often suffer from high latency, while emerging learning-based approaches struggle to ensure deterministic feasibility. To bridge the gap from embodied to embedded intelligence, we propose a self-supervised framework incorporating a differentiable hard constraint projection layer for runtime assurance. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct a Global-Guided Artificial Potential Field (G-APF), which provides dense supervision signals without manual labeling. To enforce actuator limitations and geometric constraints efficiently, we employ an adaptive neural projection layer, which iteratively rectifies the coarse network output onto the feasible manifold. Extensive benchmarks on a test set of 20,000 scenarios demonstrate an 88.75\\% success rate, substantiating the enhanced operational safety. Closed-loop experiments in CARLA further validate the physical realizability of the planned paths under dynamic constraints. Furthermore, deployment verification on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX confirms an inference latency of 94 ms, showing real-time feasibility on resource-constrained embedded hardware. This framework offers a generalized paradigm for embedding physical laws into neural architectures, providing a viable direction for solving constrained optimization in mechatronics.

We introduce PsyProbe, a dialogue system designed for the exploration phase of counseling that systematically tracks user psychological states through the PPPPPI framework (Presenting, Predisposing, Precipitating, Perpetuating, Protective, Impact) augmented with cognitive error detection. PsyProbe combines State Builder for extracting structured psychological profiles, Memory Construction for tracking information gaps, Strategy Planner for Motivational Interviewing behavioral codes, and Response Generator with Question Ideation and Critic/Revision modules to generate contextually appropriate, proactive questions. We evaluate PsyProbe with 27 participants in real-world Korean counseling scenarios, including automatic evaluation across ablation modes, user evaluation, and expert evaluation by a certified counselor. The full PsyProbe model consistently outperforms baseline and ablation modes in automatic evaluation. User evaluation demonstrates significantly increased engagement intention and improved naturalness compared to baseline. Expert evaluation shows that PsyProbe substantially improves core issue understanding and achieves question rates comparable to professional counselors, validating the effectiveness of systematic state modeling and proactive questioning for therapeutic exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "PsyProbe\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f0f\u5fc3\u7406\u54a8\u8be2\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PPPPPI\u6846\u67b6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7528\u6237\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u4e3b\u52a8\u6cbb\u7597\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u4e3a\u88ab\u52a8\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u7528\u6237\u72b6\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3b\u52a8\u6cbb\u7597\u6027\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7528\u6237\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u5e76\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfc\u54a8\u8be2\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPsyProbe\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1) State Builder\u57fa\u4e8ePPPPPI\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5448\u73b0\u3001\u6613\u611f\u3001\u8bf1\u53d1\u3001\u7ef4\u6301\u3001\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5fc3\u7406\u6863\u6848\uff1b2) Memory Construction\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u53e3\uff1b3) Strategy Planner\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u673a\u8bbf\u8c08\u884c\u4e3a\u7f16\u7801\uff1b4) Response Generator\u5305\u542b\u95ee\u9898\u6784\u601d\u548c\u6279\u8bc4/\u4fee\u8ba2\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u4e3b\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u572827\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u97e9\u56fd\u5fc3\u7406\u54a8\u8be2\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1a1) \u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5b8c\u6574PsyProbe\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b2) \u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u53c2\u4e0e\u610f\u613f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\u6539\u5584\uff1b3) \u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u95ee\u9898\u8d28\u91cf\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u4e1a\u54a8\u8be2\u5e08\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u63d0\u95ee\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5fc3\u7406\u54a8\u8be2\u63a2\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0cPsyProbe\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u7528\u6237\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4e13\u4e1a\u7ea7\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u6cbb\u7597\u6027\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

The government places a strong emphasis on preserving and promoting the Bahnaric language by making it accessible online and encouraging communication across generations. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, such as Neural Machine Translation (NMT), have brought about a transformation in translation by improving accuracy and fluency. This, in turn, contributes to the revival of the language through educational efforts, communication, and documentation. Specifically, NMT is pivotal in enhancing accessibility for Bahnaric speakers, making information and content more readily available. Nevertheless, the translation of Vietnamese into Bahnaric faces practical challenges due to resource constraints, especially given the limited resources available for the Bahnaric language. To address this, we employ state-of-the-art techniques in NMT along with two augmentation strategies for domain-specific Vietnamese-Bahnaric translation task.

Judgelight collapses closed subwalks in agents' trajectories to remove redundant movements while preserving all feasibility constraints. We formalize this process as MAPF-Collapse, prove that it is NP-hard, and present an exact optimization approach by formulating it as integer linear programming (ILP) problem.

However, these sources suffer from the sim-to-real visual gap and the human-to-robot embodiment gap, respectively, which limits the policy's generalization to real-world scenarios. In this work, we identify a natural yet underexplored complementarity between these sources: simulation offers the robot action that human data lacks, while human data provides the real-world observation that simulation struggles to render. Motivated by this insight, we present SimHum, a co-training framework to simultaneously extract kinematic prior from simulated robot actions and visual prior from real-world human observations.

However, their robustness against textual misinformation remains under-explored. While existing research has studied the effect of misinformation in text-only domains, it is not clear how VLMs arbitrate between contradictory information from different modalities. To bridge the gap, we first propose the CONTEXT-VQA (i.e., Conflicting Text) dataset, consisting of image-question pairs together with systematically generated persuasive prompts that deliberately conflict with visual evidence. Then, a thorough evaluation framework is designed and executed to benchmark the susceptibility of various models to these conflicting multimodal inputs. Comprehensive experiments over 11 state-of-the-art VLMs reveal that these models are indeed vulnerable to misleading textual prompts, often overriding clear visual evidence in favor of the conflicting text, and show an average performance drop of over 48.2% after only one round of persuasive conversation. Our findings highlight a critical limitation in current VLMs and underscore the need for improved robustness against textual manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6709\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u76f8\u4fe1\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u8d85\u8fc748.2%\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e0d\u6e05\u695aVLM\u5982\u4f55\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u51faCONTEXT-VQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56fe\u50cf-\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u4ee5\u53ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u7136\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf911\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684VLM\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u786e\u5b9e\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u51b2\u7a81\u6587\u672c\u800c\u975e\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u4ec5\u4e00\u8f6e\u8bf4\u670d\u6027\u5bf9\u8bdd\u540e\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u8d85\u8fc748.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dVLM\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u64cd\u7eb5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Conversely, task-only reinforcement learning admits many task-optimal solutions, often resulting in unnatural or unstable motions. This exposes a fundamental limitation of linear reward mixing in adversarial imitation learning. We propose \\emph{Task-Centric Motion Priors} (TCMP), a task-priority adversarial imitation framework that treats imitation as a conditional regularizer rather than a co-equal objective. TCMP maximizes task improvement while incorporating imitation signals only when they are compatible with task progress, yielding an adaptive, geometry-aware update that preserves task-feasible descent and suppresses harmful imitation under misalignment.

Understanding how these associations are learned and represented in language models is essential for connecting deep learning with linguistic theory and developing a mechanistic foundation for large language models. In this work, we analyze how these associations emerge from natural language data in attention-based language models through the lens of training dynamics. By leveraging a leading-term approximation of the gradients, we develop closed-form expressions for the weights at early stages of training that explain how semantic associations first take shape. Through our analysis, we reveal that each set of weights of the transformer has closed-form expressions as simple compositions of three basis functions (bigram, token-interchangeability, and context mappings), reflecting the statistics of the text corpus and uncovering how each component of the transformer captures semantic associations based on these compositions. Experiments on real-world LLMs demonstrate that our theoretical weight characterizations closely match the learned weights, and qualitative analyses further show how our theorem shines light on interpreting the learned associations in transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86Transformer\u6743\u91cd\u7531\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u7840\u51fd\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\u800c\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8868\u793a\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fde\u63a5\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5efa\u7acb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u673a\u5236\u57fa\u7840\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\uff08\u5982\"\u9e1f\"\u548c\"\u98de\"\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff09\u662f\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u8d85\u8d8a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u6587\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u9879\u8fd1\u4f3c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eTransformer\u7684\u6bcf\u7ec4\u6743\u91cd\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u7840\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u4e8c\u5143\u7ec4\u3001\u4ee4\u724c\u53ef\u4e92\u6362\u6027\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6620\u5c04\uff09\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u6743\u91cd\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u91caTransformer\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86Transformer\u6743\u91cd\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u7edf\u8ba1\u57fa\u7840\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6765\u6355\u83b7\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

A common approach to provide formal goal-reaching guarantees is to introduce a shielding mechanism that restricts the agent to actions that satisfy predefined safety constraints. The main challenge here is integrating this mechanism with RL so that learning and exploration remain effective without becoming overly conservative. Hence, this paper proposes an RL-based control framework that provides formal goal-reaching guarantees for wheeled mobile robots operating in unstructured environments. We first design a real-time RL policy with a set of 15 carefully defined reward terms. These rewards encourage the robot to reach both static and dynamic goals while generating sufficiently smooth command signals that comply with predefined safety specifications, which is critical in practice. Second, a Lyapunov-like stabilizer layer is integrated into the benchmark RL framework as a policy supervisor to formally strengthen the goal-reaching control while preserving meaningful exploration of the state action space. The proposed framework is suitable for real-time deployment in challenging environments, as it provides a formal guarantee of convergence to the intended goal states and compensates for uncertainties by generating real-time control signals based on the current state, while respecting real-world motion constraints. The experimental results show that the proposed Lyapunov-like stabilizer consistently improves the benchmark RL policies, boosting the goal-reaching rate from 84.6% to 99.0%, sharply reducing failures, and improving efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6e\u5f0f\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5230\u8fbe\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c06\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece84.6%\u63d0\u5347\u81f399.0%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u5230\u8fbe\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\u76ee\u6807\u4e00\u5b9a\u80fd\u5230\u8fbe\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u5c4f\u853d\u673a\u5236\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f46\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u53c8\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u542b15\u4e2a\u5956\u52b1\u9879\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5230\u8fbe\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b89\u5168\u89c4\u8303\uff1b2. \u5728\u57fa\u51c6RL\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u7c7b\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u76d1\u7763\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u72b6\u6001\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u589e\u5f3a\u76ee\u6807\u5230\u8fbe\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u7c7b\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u51c6RL\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u5230\u8fbe\u7387\u4ece84.6%\u63d0\u5347\u81f399.0%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5931\u8d25\u7387\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u9002\u5408\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6e\u5f0f\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e2\u6709\u6548\u53c8\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

However, there is a significant lack of research into their internal state as an editable knowledge representation. To fill this gap, we first explore the representational properties of the RWKV state by proposing the DREAMSTATE framework. This framework utilizes a conditional Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to directly model the probability manifold of the state, enabling its generation and editing. The structural nature of this representation is validated through t-SNE visualizations and controlled generation experiments. After successfully uncovering and modeling the state's representational potential, we further propose a novel hybrid architecture that combines the local advantages of RNNs with global context adaptability. This architecture features a parallel DiT that processes a variable-length global context to dynamically generate and adjust the core recurrent module's WKV parameters, transforming the fixed recurrence mechanism into a context-aware dynamic function. Experiments demonstrate that this hybrid model can be trained stably via a multi-objective loss, validating its design feasibility.

Conventional approaches project DVL velocities from the body coordinate system to the navigation coordinate system using SINS-derived attitude; however, accumulated attitude estimation errors introduce biases into velocity projection and degrade navigation performance during long-term operation. To address this issue, two complementary improvements are introduced. First, a vehicle attitude error-aware DVL velocity transformation model is formulated by incorporating attitude error terms into the observation equation to reduce projection-induced velocity bias. Second, a covariance matrix-based variance propagation method is developed to transform DVL measurement uncertainty across coordinate systems, introducing an expectation-based attitude error compensation term to achieve statistically consistent noise modeling. Simulation and field experiment results demonstrate that both improvements individually enhance navigation accuracy and confirm that accumulated attitude errors affect both projected velocity measurements and their associated uncertainty. When jointly applied, long-term error divergence is effectively suppressed. Field experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a 78.3% improvement in 3D position RMSE and a 71.8% reduction in the maximum component-wise position error compared with the baseline IMU+DVL method, providing a robust solution for improving long-term SINS/DVL navigation performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684SINS/DVL\u677e\u8026\u5408\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u59ff\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u7684DVL\u901f\u5ea6\u53d8\u6362\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u671f\u5bfc\u822a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfSINS/DVL\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SINS\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u5c06DVL\u901f\u5ea6\u4ece\u673a\u4f53\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u53d8\u6362\u5230\u5bfc\u822a\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u65f6\uff0c\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u4f1a\u7d2f\u79ef\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u901f\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u957f\u671f\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u6539\u8fdb\uff1a1\uff09\u5efa\u7acb\u59ff\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u7684DVL\u901f\u5ea6\u53d8\u6362\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u59ff\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u9879\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6295\u5f71\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\uff1b2\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u671f\u671b\u59ff\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u8865\u507f\u9879\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u73b0\u573a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u5747\u80fd\u5355\u72ec\u63d0\u5347\u5bfc\u822a\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u957f\u671f\u8bef\u5dee\u53d1\u6563\u3002\u73b0\u573a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebfIMU+DVL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c3D\u4f4d\u7f6eRMSE\u63d0\u534778.3%\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5206\u91cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c1171.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u611f\u77e5DVL\u901f\u5ea6\u53d8\u6362\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3SINS/DVL\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u59ff\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bfc\u822a\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u671f\u6c34\u4e0b\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by grounding answers in external sources, e.g., knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing KG-based RAG approaches rely on semantics-unaware path sampling and are weakly aligned with KG reasoning objectives, which limits further accuracy gains. They also feed retrieved paths directly into the reasoner without organizing them into answer-centered reasoning paths, hindering small LLMs' ability to leverage the retrieved knowledge. Furthermore, prior works predominantly rely on large LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT/GPT-4) or assume backbones above 7B parameters, leaving sub-7B models underexplored. We address this gap with RPO-RAG, the first KG-based RAG framework specifically designed for small LLMs, to the best of our knowledge. RPO-RAG introduces three key innovations: (1) a query-path semantic sampling strategy that provides informative supervisory signals; (2) a relation-aware preference optimization that aligns training with intermediate KG reasoning signals (e.g., relation); and (3) an answer-centered prompt design that organizes entities and reasoning paths in an interpretable format. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that RPO-RAG effectively bridges the performance gap between small and large language models. On WebQSP, it improves F1 by up to 8.8%, reflecting enhanced answer precision, while on CWQ it achieves new state-of-the-art results among models under 8B parameters in both Hit and F1. Overall, RPO-RAG substantially improves the reasoning capability of small LLMs, even under 3B parameters-highlighting their potential for resource-efficient and practical on-device KGQA applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "RPO-RAG\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3a\u5c0f\u578bLLM\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728KGQA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u4e49\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4e0eKG\u63a8\u7406\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f31\uff1b2\uff09\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u76f4\u63a5\u8f93\u5165\u63a8\u7406\u5668\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b3\uff09\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982GPT-4\uff09\u62167B\u4ee5\u4e0a\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf97B\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "RPO-RAG\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1\uff09\u67e5\u8be2-\u8def\u5f84\u8bed\u4e49\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b2\uff09\u5173\u7cfb\u611f\u77e5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0eKG\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u95f4\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b3\uff09\u7b54\u6848\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u683c\u5f0f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2aKGQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08WebQSP\u548cCWQ\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u5728WebQSP\u4e0aF1\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe8.8%\uff0c\u5728CWQ\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e868B\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0SOTA\u7ed3\u679c\uff08Hit\u548cF1\uff09\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u57283B\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "RPO-RAG\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u8bbe\u5907\u7aefKGQA\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c0f\u578bLLM\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, their integration in robotic control pipelines remains limited in two aspects: (1) prior \\ac{llm}-based approaches often lack modular, agentic execution mechanisms, limiting their ability to plan, reflect on outcomes, and revise actions in a closed-loop manner; and (2) existing benchmarks for manipulation tasks focus on low-level control and do not systematically evaluate multistep reasoning and linguistic variation. In this paper, we propose Agentic LLM for Robot Manipulation (ALRM), an LLM-driven agentic framework for robotic manipulation. ALRM integrates policy generation with agentic execution through a ReAct-style reasoning loop, supporting two complementary modes: Code-asPolicy (CaP) for direct executable control code generation, and Tool-as-Policy (TaP) for iterative planning and tool-based action execution. To enable systematic evaluation, we also introduce a novel simulation benchmark comprising 56 tasks across multiple environments, capturing linguistically diverse instructions. Experiments with ten LLMs demonstrate that ALRM provides a scalable, interpretable, and modular approach for bridging natural language reasoning with reliable robotic execution.

Existing methods address individual axes of generalization, workspace shifts, viewpoint changes, and cross-embodiment transfer, yet they are typically developed in isolation and often rely on complex pipelines. We introduce PALM (Perception Alignment for Local Manipulation), which leverages the invariance of local action distributions between out-of-distribution (OOD) and demonstrated domains to address these OOD shifts concurrently, without additional input modalities, model changes, or data collection. PALM modularizes the manipulation policy into coarse global components and a local policy for fine-grained actions. We reduce the discrepancy between in-domain and OOD inputs at the local policy level by enforcing local visual focus and consistent proprioceptive representation, allowing the policy to retrieve invariant local actions under OOD conditions. Experiments show that PALM limits OOD performance drops to 8% in simulation and 24% in the real world, compared to 45% and 77% for baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "PALM\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5e03\u5728OOD\u548c\u6f14\u793a\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u8de8\u5177\u8eab\u8f6c\u79fb\u7b49OOD\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u6539\u6216\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u57df\u4e4b\u5916\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5355\u72ec\u5904\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u6216\u8de8\u5177\u8eab\u8f6c\u79fb\u7b49\u7279\u5b9a\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cdOOD\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "PALM\u5c06\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e3a\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5168\u5c40\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c40\u90e8\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u5c40\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u805a\u7126\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u53d7\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u57df\u5185\u548cOOD\u8f93\u5165\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u7b56\u7565\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f7f\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u5728OOD\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPALM\u5c06OOD\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u9650\u5236\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d8%\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c24%\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u4e3a45%\u548c77%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PALM\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u79cdOOD\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u3002"}}

The system includes a triples creator that builds structured facts about a concept, a semantic mapper that selects attributes useful for analogy, a stylized generator that turns them into riddle clues, and a validator that collects all possible answers the riddle could point to. We use this validator to study whether large language models can recover the full answer set for different riddle types.

However, existing widely adopted model-based draft designs, such as EAGLE3, improve accuracy at the cost of multi-step autoregressive inference, resulting in high drafting latency and ultimately rendering the drafting stage itself a performance bottleneck. Inspired by diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), we propose DART, which leverages parallel generation to reduce drafting latency. DART predicts logits for multiple future masked positions in parallel within a single forward pass based on hidden states of the target model, thereby eliminating autoregressive rollouts in the draft model while preserving a lightweight design. Based on these parallel logit predictions, we further introduce an efficient tree pruning algorithm that constructs high-quality draft token trees with N-gram-enforced semantic continuity. DART substantially reduces draft-stage overhead while preserving high draft accuracy, leading to significantly improved end-to-end decoding speed. Experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves a 2.03x--3.44x wall-clock time speedup across multiple datasets, surpassing EAGLE3 by 30% on average and offering a practical speculative decoding framework.

In this framework, Catmull-Rom splines are utilized to characterize lane lines, and all the other ground markings are depicted using polygons uniformly. The results from instance segmentation serve as references to refine the three-dimensional position of spline control points and polygon corner points. In conjunction with this process, the homography matrix of IPM and vehicle poses are optimized simultaneously. Our proposed framework significantly reduces the mapping errors associated with IPM. It also improves the accuracy of the initial IPM homography matrix and the predicted vehicle poses. Furthermore, it addresses the limitations imposed by the coplanarity assumption in IPM. These enhancements enable IPM to be effectively applied to vectorized road mapping, which serves a cost-effective solution with enhanced accuracy. In addition, our framework generalizes road map elements to include all common ground markings and lane lines. The proposed framework is evaluated in two different practical scenarios, and the test results show that our method can automatically generate high-precision maps with near-centimeter-level accuracy.

However, their high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and sparsity make clinical prediction challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) allowed progress towards addressing this challenge by leveraging parametric medical knowledge to enhance EHR data for clinical prediction tasks. Despite the significant achievements made so far, most of the existing approaches are fundamentally task-agnostic in the sense that they deploy LLMs as EHR encoders or EHR completion modules without fully integrating signals from the prediction tasks. This naturally hinders task performance accuracy. In this work, we propose Rewrite-To-Predict (ReToP), an LLM-based framework that addresses this limitation through an end-to-end training of an EHR rewriter and a clinical predictor. To cope with the lack of EHR rewrite training data, we generate synthetic pseudo-labels using clinical-driven feature selection strategies to create diverse patient rewrites for fine-tuning the EHR rewriter. ReToP aligns the rewriter with prediction objectives using a novel Classifier Supervised Contribution (CSC) score that enables the EHR rewriter to generate clinically relevant rewrites that directly enhance prediction. Our ReToP framework surpasses strong baseline models across three clinical tasks on MIMIC-IV. Moreover, the analysis of ReToP shows its generalizability to unseen datasets and tasks with minimal fine-tuning while preserving faithful rewrites and emphasizing task-relevant predictive features.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReToP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3EHR\u91cd\u5199\u5668\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u91cd\u5199\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u591a\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\uff0c\u4ec5\u5c06LLM\u7528\u4f5cEHR\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6216\u8865\u5168\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6574\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReToP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bEHR\u91cd\u5199\u5668\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u76d1\u7763\u8d21\u732e\uff08CSC\uff09\u5206\u6570\u4f7f\u91cd\u5199\u5668\u751f\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u91cd\u5199", "result": "\u5728MIMIC-IV\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793aReToP\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5fe0\u5b9e\u91cd\u5199\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81", "conclusion": "ReToP\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684EHR\u91cd\u5199\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3aEHR\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def"}}

We observe that VLA inference exhibits structured redundancies across temporal, spatial, and depth dimensions, and that most existing efficiency methods ignore action context, despite its central role in embodied tasks. To address this gap, we propose Action-Context-aware Adaptive Computation for VLA models (AC^2-VLA), a unified framework that conditions computation on current visual observations, language instructions, and previous action states. Based on this action-centric context, AC^2-VLA adaptively performs cognition reuse across timesteps, token pruning, and selective execution of model components within a unified mechanism. To train the adaptive policy, we introduce an action-guided self-distillation scheme that preserves the behavior of the dense VLA policy while enabling structured sparsification that transfers across tasks and settings. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks show that AC^2-VLA achieves up to a 1.79\\times speedup while reducing FLOPs to 29.4% of the dense baseline, with comparable task success.", "AI": {"tldr": "AC\u00b2-VLA\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba4\u77e5\u91cd\u7528\u3001token\u526a\u679d\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6267\u884c\u6765\u52a0\u901fVLA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dVLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u95ed\u73af\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u91cd\u590d\u8fd0\u884c\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d77\u7740\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAC\u00b2-VLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u5bdf\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u5148\u524d\u52a8\u4f5c\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u673a\u5236\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6267\u884c\uff1a1\uff09\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u91cd\u7528\uff1b2\uff09token\u526a\u679d\uff1b3\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6267\u884c\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u4f5c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5bc6\u96c6VLA\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAC\u00b2-VLA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad81.79\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5c06FLOPs\u964d\u4f4e\u5230\u5bc6\u96c6\u57fa\u7ebf\u768429.4%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "AC\u00b2-VLA\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u95ed\u73af\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u5177\u8eabAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, most existing systems still rely on a fixed role library and an execution-frozen interaction topology, a rigid design choice that frequently leads to task mismatch, prevents timely adaptation when new evidence emerges during reasoning, and further inflates inference cost. We introduce MetaGen, a training-free framework that adapts both the role space and the collaboration topology at inference time, without updating base model weights. MetaGen generates and rewrites query-conditioned role specifications to maintain a controllable dynamic role pool, then instantiates a constrained execution graph around a minimal backbone. During execution, it iteratively updates role prompts and adjusts structural decisions using lightweight feedback signals. Experiments on code generation and multi-step reasoning benchmarks show that MetaGen improves the accuracy and cost tradeoff over strong multi-agent baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "MetaGen\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u89d2\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u5e93\u548c\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u521a\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ca\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "MetaGen\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u548c\u91cd\u5199\u67e5\u8be2\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u89c4\u8303\u6765\u7ef4\u62a4\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89d2\u8272\u6c60\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u56f4\u7ed5\u6700\u5c0f\u9aa8\u5e72\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u6267\u884c\u56fe\u3002\u5728\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\u89d2\u8272\u63d0\u793a\u5e76\u8c03\u6574\u7ed3\u6784\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMetaGen\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6743\u8861\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "MetaGen\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u89d2\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u66f4\u65b0\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u521a\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, applied mathematics problems in domains like finance, physics, and cryptography often require recalling or deriving governing equations, a step that current approaches do not explicitly leverage. We propose Formula-One Prompting (F-1), a two-phase approach that uses mathematical equations as an intermediate representation before adaptive solving. F-1 first formulates governing equations from problem descriptions, then selects a solving strategy among CoT, PoT, or direct computation based on the generated equations, all within a single LLM call. Results across five models and four benchmarks show F-1 outperforms CoT by +5.76% and PoT by +8.42% on average. Crucially, gains are largest in applied domains: +13.30% on FinanceMath over CoT, and within OlympiadBench, larger gains on physics (+2.55%) than pure math (+0.44%).

However, its reliability is increasingly threatened by test set contamination, where test samples or their close variants leak into training data and artificially inflate reported performance. To address this issue, prior work has explored two main lines of mitigation. One line attempts to identify and remove contaminated benchmark items before evaluation, but this inevitably alters the evaluation set itself and becomes unreliable when contamination is moderate or severe. The other line preserves the benchmark and instead suppresses contaminated behavior at evaluation time; however, such interventions often interfere with normal inference and lead to noticeable performance degradation on clean inputs. We propose DeconIEP, a decontamination framework that operates entirely during evaluation by applying small, bounded perturbations in the input embedding space. Guided by a relatively less-contaminated reference model, DeconIEP learns an instance-adaptive perturbation generator that steers the evaluated model away from memorization-driven shortcut pathways. Across multiple open-weight LLMs and benchmarks, extensive empirical results show that DeconIEP achieves strong decontamination effectiveness while incurring only minimal degradation in benign utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeconIEP\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u65bd\u52a0\u5c0f\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u754c\u6270\u52a8\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u57fa\u51c6\u6216\u5e72\u6270\u6b63\u5e38\u63a8\u7406", "motivation": "\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6c61\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u5373\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6837\u672c\u6216\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\u6cc4\u9732\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0c\u4eba\u4e3a\u5938\u5927\u4e86\u62a5\u544a\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6539\u57fa\u51c6\u96c6\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f1a\u5e72\u6270\u6b63\u5e38\u63a8\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "DeconIEP\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u671f\u95f4\u5b8c\u5168\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u65bd\u52a0\u5c0f\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u754c\u6270\u52a8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c11\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u4f8b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u88ab\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8fdc\u79bb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6377\u5f84\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDeconIEP\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u53bb\u6c61\u67d3\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u826f\u6027\u6548\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u4ec5\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u5c0f\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "DeconIEP\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u53bb\u6c61\u67d3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u57fa\u51c6\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u6b63\u5e38\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6c61\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Existing approaches typically rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate context-aware responses based on user metadata and historical interactions or on adaptive methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) to learn from users' immediate reactions in real time. However, these approaches fall short of comprehensively capturing user preferences-including long-term, short-term, and fine-grained aspects-, and of using them to rank and select actions, proactively personalize interactions, and ensure ethically responsible adaptations. To address the limitations, we propose drawing on recommender systems (RSs), which specialize in modeling user preferences and providing personalized recommendations. To ensure the integration of RS techniques is well-grounded and seamless throughout the social robot pipeline, we (i) align the paradigms underlying social robots and RSs, (ii) identify key techniques that can enhance personalization in social robots, and (iii) design them as modular, plug-and-play components.

Validated across translation, summarization and clinical note-generation, our framework identifies critical errors, such as content omissions and factual contradictions, missed by standard metrics. A key contribution is a systematic robustness analysis to select a stable judge model. Crucially, the strong correlation between our reference-free and with-reference modes validates CEF's reliability without gold references.

Results revealed that anthropomorphism determines whether people extend moral consideration to robots, while moral foundations shape how they reason about such consideration.

However, its adoption for bimanual tasks is an underexplored problem due to the complexity of hand coordination, which also hinders data recording. This paper presents a novel one-shot method for processing a single RGB video of a bimanual task demonstration to generate an execution plan for a dual-arm robotic system. To detect hand coordination policies, we apply Shannon's information theory to analyze the information flow between scene elements and leverage scene graph properties. The generated plan is a modular behavior tree that assumes different structures based on the desired arms coordination.

Although recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong translation capabilities, their effectiveness for APE--especially under document-level context--remains insufficiently understood. We present a systematic comparison of proprietary and open-weight LLMs under a naive document-level prompting setup, analyzing APE quality, contextual behavior, robustness, and efficiency.\n  Our results show that proprietary LLMs achieve near human-level APE quality even with simple one-shot prompting, regardless of whether document context is provided. While these models exhibit higher robustness to data poisoning attacks than open-weight counterparts, this robustness also reveals a limitation: they largely fail to exploit document-level context for contextual error correction. Furthermore, standard automatic metrics do not reliably reflect these qualitative improvements, highlighting the continued necessity of human evaluation. Despite their strong performance, the substantial cost and latency overheads of proprietary LLMs render them impractical for real-world APE deployment. Overall, our findings elucidate both the promise and current limitations of LLM-based document-aware APE, and point toward the need for more efficient long-context modeling approaches for translation refinement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e13\u6709\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u6863\u7ea7\u81ea\u52a8\u540e\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6587\u6863\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u6587\u6863\u7ea7\u81ea\u52a8\u540e\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5229\u7528\u6587\u6863\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6587\u6863\u7ea7\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e13\u6709\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790APE\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u4e13\u6709LLMs\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u63d0\u793a\u4e5f\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u7684APE\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6587\u6863\u7ea7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u52a8\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u53cd\u6620\u8d28\u91cf\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5728\u6587\u6863\u611f\u77e5APE\u65b9\u9762\u65e2\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4e5f\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u6307\u6807\u4ecd\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u8865\u5145\u3002"}}

KG-CRAFT first constructs a knowledge graph from claims and associated reports, then formulates contextually relevant contrastive questions based on the knowledge graph structure. These questions guide the distillation of evidence-based reports, which are synthesised into a concise summary that is used for veracity assessment by LLMs. Extensive evaluations on two real-world datasets (LIAR-RAW and RAWFC) demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art in predictive performance. Comprehensive analyses validate in detail the effectiveness of our knowledge graph-based contrastive reasoning approach in improving LLMs' fact-checking capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "KG-CRAFT\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5bf9\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728LIAR-RAW\u548cRAWFC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u58f0\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9700\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ef\u9760\u8bc1\u636e\u6e90\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b", "method": "1. \u4ece\u58f0\u660e\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff1b2. \u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u95ee\u9898\uff1b3. \u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u6307\u5bfc\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u62a5\u544a\u63d0\u70bc\uff1b4. \u5c06\u63d0\u70bc\u7ed3\u679c\u5408\u6210\u7b80\u660e\u6458\u8981\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08LIAR-RAW\u548cRAWFC\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u5347LLM\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "KG-CRAFT\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u58f0\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6"}}

While effective in monolingual settings, a single projector struggles to capture the diverse acoustic-to-semantic mappings required for multilingual ASR. To address this, we propose SMEAR-MoE, a stabilized Mixture-of-Experts projector that ensures dense gradient flow to all experts, preventing expert collapse while enabling cross-lingual sharing. We systematically compare monolithic, static multi-projector, and dynamic MoE designs across four Indic languages (Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu). Our SMEAR-MoE achieves strong performance, delivering upto a 7.6% relative WER reduction over the single-projector baseline, while maintaining comparable runtime efficiency. Analysis of expert routing further shows linguistically meaningful specialization, with related languages sharing experts.

This is particularly important because debunking false information typically takes longer to reach consumers than the misinformation itself; accelerating corrections through automation can therefore help counter it more effectively. Although many organizations perform manual fact-checking, this approach is difficult to scale given the growing volume of digital content. These limitations have motivated interest in automating fact-checking, where identifying claims is a crucial first step. However, progress has been uneven across languages, with English dominating due to abundant annotated data. Portuguese, like other languages, still lacks accessible, licensed datasets, limiting research, NLP developments and applications. In this paper, we introduce ClaimPT, a dataset of European Portuguese news articles annotated for factual claims, comprising 1,308 articles and 6,875 individual annotations. Unlike most existing resources based on social media or parliamentary transcripts, ClaimPT focuses on journalistic content, collected through a partnership with LUSA, the Portuguese News Agency.

Structured pruning methods are primarily employed to improve the inference efficiency of pre-trained models. Meanwhile, they often require additional time and memory for training, knowledge distillation, structure search, and other strategies, making efficient model fine-tuning challenging to achieve. To simultaneously enhance the training and inference efficiency of downstream task fine-tuning, we introduce GradPruner, which can prune layers of LLMs guided by gradients in the early stages of fine-tuning. GradPruner uses the cumulative gradients of each parameter during the initial phase of fine-tuning to compute the Initial Gradient Information Accumulation Matrix (IGIA-Matrix) to assess the importance of layers and perform pruning. We sparsify the pruned layers based on the IGIA-Matrix and merge them with the remaining layers. Only elements with the same sign are merged to reduce interference from sign variations. We conducted extensive experiments on two LLMs across eight downstream datasets. Including medical, financial, and general benchmark tasks. The results demonstrate that GradPruner has achieved a parameter reduction of 40% with only a 0.99% decrease in accuracy.

Thus, they may fail to keep pace with rapidly evolving models and emerging risks. To address these limitations, we propose VLSafetyBencher, the first automated system for LVLM safety benchmarking. VLSafetyBencher introduces four collaborative agents: Data Preprocessing, Generation, Augmentation, and Selection agents to construct and select high-quality samples.

To address these challenges, we introduce Yunque DeepResearch, a hierarchical, modular, and robust framework.

However, scaling such refinement to naturalistic NLI remains difficult: long, syntactically rich inputs and deep multi-step arguments amplify autoformalisation errors, where a single local mismatch can invalidate the proof. Moreover, current methods often handle failures via costly global regeneration due to the difficulty of localising the responsible span or step from prover diagnostics. Aiming to address these problems, we propose a decompose-and-formalise framework that (i) decomposes premise-hypothesis pairs into an entailment tree of atomic steps, (ii) verifies the tree bottom-up to isolate failures to specific nodes, and (iii) performs local diagnostic-guided refinement instead of regenerating the whole explanation. Moreover, to improve faithfulness of autoformalisation, we introduce $\u03b8$-substitution in an event-based logical form to enforce consistent argument-role bindings. Across a range of reasoning tasks using five LLM backbones, our method achieves the highest explanation verification rates, improving over the state-of-the-art by 26.2%, 21.7%, 21.6% and 48.9%, while reducing refinement iterations and runtime and preserving strong NLI accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u89e3-\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u524d\u63d0-\u5047\u8bbe\u5bf9\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u8574\u542b\u6811\uff0c\u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee5\u9694\u79bb\u5931\u8d25\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u8bca\u65ad\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\u800c\u975e\u5168\u5c40\u91cd\u65b0\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u957f\u800c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u653e\u5927\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5355\u4e2a\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5c31\u4f1a\u4f7f\u8bc1\u660e\u65e0\u6548\uff1b2\uff09\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u91cd\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u89e3-\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06\u524d\u63d0-\u5047\u8bbe\u5bf9\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u8574\u542b\u6811\uff1b2\uff09\u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u9694\u79bb\u5931\u8d25\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u8282\u70b9\uff1b3\uff09\u6267\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u8bca\u65ad\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\u800c\u975e\u91cd\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u6574\u4e2a\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e8b\u4ef6\u903b\u8f91\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u03b8-\u66ff\u6362\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bba\u5143\u89d2\u8272\u7ed1\u5b9a\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9aa8\u5e72\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8626.2%\u300121.7%\u300121.6%\u548c48.9%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7ec6\u5316\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u89e3-\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u5931\u8d25\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

However, their reliance on autoregressive inference, which generates outputs sequentially, creates a significant efficiency bottleneck, especially as KIE tasks often involve extracting multiple, semantically independent fields. To overcome this limitation, we introduce PIP: a Parallel Inference Paradigm for KIE. Our approach reformulates the problem by using \"[mask]\" tokens as placeholders for all target values, enabling their simultaneous generation in a single forward pass. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a tailored mask pre-training strategy and construct large-scale supervised datasets. Experimental results show that our PIP-models achieve a 5-36x inference speedup with negligible performance degradation compared to traditional autoregressive base models.

We address this evaluation bottleneck by introducing LR-bench, a high-fidelity, up-to-date benchmark curated from 2024-2025 AI/NLP manuscripts with five-level self-assessed familiarity ratings collected via a large-scale email survey, yielding 1055 expert-annotated paper-reviewer-score annotations. We further propose RATE, a reviewer-centric ranking framework that distills each reviewer's recent publications into compact keyword-based profiles and fine-tunes an embedding model with weak preference supervision constructed from heuristic retrieval signals, enabling matching each manuscript against a reviewer profile directly. Across LR-bench and the CMU gold-standard dataset, our approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong embedding baselines by a clear margin.

Despite these advantages, there is a critical instability in DLMs: the moving sink phenomenon. Our analysis indicates that sink tokens exhibit low-norm representations in the Transformer's value space, and that the moving sink phenomenon serves as a protective mechanism in DLMs to prevent excessive information mixing. However, their unpredictable positions across diffusion steps undermine inference robustness. To resolve this, we propose a simple but effective extra sink token implemented via a modified attention mask. Specifically, we introduce a special token constrained to attend solely to itself, while remaining globally visible to all other tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that introducing a single extra token stabilizes attention sinks, substantially improving model performance. Crucially, further analysis confirms that the effectiveness of this token is independent of its position and characterized by negligible semantic content, validating its role as a robust and dedicated structural sink.", "AI": {"tldr": "DLMs\u5b58\u5728\u79fb\u52a8sink\u73b0\u8c61\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u989d\u5916sink token\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u79fb\u52a8sink\u73b0\u8c61\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0csink token\u5728Transformer\u503c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u8303\u6570\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u79fb\u52a8sink\u73b0\u8c61\u662f\u9632\u6b62\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u63a8\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u989d\u5916sink token\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1a\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u6b8atoken\uff0c\u8be5token\u53ea\u80fd\u5173\u6ce8\u81ea\u8eab\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u5176\u4ed6token\u5168\u5c40\u53ef\u89c1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5355\u4e2a\u989d\u5916token\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529bsink\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u786e\u8ba4\u8be5token\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a33\u5065\u4e13\u7528\u7ed3\u6784sink\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e13\u7528\u7ed3\u6784sink token\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3DLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u79fb\u52a8sink\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Evaluating data efficiency, we show that SynCABEL reaches the performance of full human supervision using up to 60% less annotated data, substantially reducing reliance on labor-intensive and costly expert labeling.

We ask whether LLMs can be systematically manipulated to reproduce language-production impairments characteristic of aphasia following focal brain lesions. Such models could provide scalable proxies for testing rehabilitation hypotheses, and offer a controlled framework for probing the functional organization of language. We introduce a clinically grounded, component-level framework that simulates aphasia by selectively perturbing functional components in LLMs, and apply it to both modular Mixture-of-Experts models and dense Transformers using a unified intervention interface. Our pipeline (i) identifies subtype-linked components for Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, (ii) interprets these components with linguistic probing tasks, and (iii) induces graded impairments by progressively perturbing the top-k subtype-linked components, evaluating outcomes with Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) subtests summarized by Aphasia Quotient (AQ). Across architectures and lesioning strategies, subtype-targeted perturbations yield more systematic, aphasia-like regressions than size-matched random perturbations, and MoE modularity supports more localized and interpretable phenotype-to-component mappings. These findings suggest that modular LLMs, combined with clinically informed component perturbations, provide a promising platform for simulating aphasic language production and studying how distinct language functions degrade under targeted disruptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u53ef\u88ab\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u4ee5\u6a21\u62df\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u8bed\u8a00\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u8ba4\u77e5\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5eb7\u590d\u5047\u8bbe\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e73\u53f0", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22LLMs\u80fd\u5426\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u8111\u635f\u4f24\u540e\u7684\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u8bed\u8a00\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u5eb7\u590d\u5047\u8bbe\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u529f\u80fd\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u63a7\u6846\u67b6", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e34\u5e8a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6270\u52a8LLMs\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6a21\u62df\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6Transformer\uff1b\u8bc6\u522bBroca\u548cWernicke\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u4e9a\u578b\u76f8\u5173\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u63a2\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u91ca\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u6270\u52a8top-k\u4e9a\u578b\u76f8\u5173\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u897f\u65b9\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u6210\u5957\u6d4b\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c", "result": "\u4e9a\u578b\u9776\u5411\u6270\u52a8\u6bd4\u5927\u5c0f\u5339\u914d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u66f4\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u7684\u56de\u5f52\uff1bMoE\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8868\u578b-\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6620\u5c04\uff1b\u6a21\u5757\u5316LLMs\u7ed3\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u606f\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6270\u52a8\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea7\u751f\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u529f\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u5e73\u53f0", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u5757\u5316LLMs\u7ed3\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u606f\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6270\u52a8\u662f\u6a21\u62df\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea7\u751f\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u529f\u80fd\u5728\u9776\u5411\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u5982\u4f55\u9000\u5316\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u5e73\u53f0"}}

Among existing memory efficient approaches, activation-related optimization has proven particularly effective, as activations consistently dominate overall memory consumption. Although prior arts offer various activation optimization strategies, their data-agnostic nature ultimately results in ineffective and unstable fine tuning. In this paper, we propose TokenSeek, a universal plugin solution for various transformer-based models through instance-aware token seeking and ditching, achieving significant fine-tuning memory savings (e.g., requiring only 14.8% of the memory on Llama3.2 1B) with on-par or even better performance. Furthermore, our interpretable token seeking process reveals the underlying reasons for its effectiveness, offering valuable insights for future research on token efficiency.

Yet existing evaluations largely remain static or outcome-centric, neglecting the evidence-gathering process. In this work, we propose an interactive evaluation framework that explicitly models the consultation process using a simulated patient and a \\rev{simulated reporter} grounded in atomic evidences. Based on this representation, we introduce Information Coverage Rate (ICR) to quantify how completely an agent uncovers necessary evidence during interaction. To support systematic study, we build EviMed, an evidence-based benchmark spanning diverse conditions from common complaints to rare diseases, and evaluate 10 models with varying reasoning abilities. We find that strong diagnostic reasoning does not guarantee effective information collection, and this insufficiency acts as a primary bottleneck limiting performance in interactive settings. To address this, we propose REFINE, a strategy that leverages diagnostic verification to guide the agent in proactively resolving uncertainties. Extensive experiments demonstrate that REFINE consistently outperforms baselines across diverse datasets and facilitates effective model collaboration, enabling smaller agents to achieve superior performance under strong reasoning supervision.

We provide the first controlled, mechanism-level diagnostic study of whether synchronized iterative retrieval and reasoning can surpass an idealized static upper bound (Gold Context) RAG. We benchmark eleven state-of-the-art LLMs under three regimes: (i) No Context, measuring reliance on parametric memory; (ii) Gold Context, where all oracle evidence is supplied at once; and (iii) Iterative RAG, a training-free controller that alternates retrieval, hypothesis refinement, and evidence-aware stopping. Using the chemistry-focused ChemKGMultiHopQA dataset, we isolate questions requiring genuine retrieval and analyze behavior with diagnostics spanning retrieval coverage gaps, anchor-carry drop, query quality, composition fidelity, and control calibration. Across models, Iterative RAG consistently outperforms Gold Context, with gains up to 25.6 percentage points, especially for non-reasoning fine-tuned models. Staged retrieval reduces late-hop failures, mitigates context overload, and enables dynamic correction of early hypothesis drift, but remaining failure modes include incomplete hop coverage, distractor latch trajectories, early stopping miscalibration, and high composition failure rates even with perfect retrieval. Overall, staged retrieval is often more influential than the mere presence of ideal evidence; we provide practical guidance for deploying and diagnosing RAG systems in specialized scientific settings and a foundation for more reliable, controllable iterative retrieval-reasoning frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fed\u4ee3\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001RAG\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4e0e\u7406\u60f3\u9ec4\u91d1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u8fbe25.6\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u540e\u671f\u8df3\u5931\u8d25\u3001\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fc7\u8f7d\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u65e9\u671f\u5047\u8bbe\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7a76\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5316\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u68c0\u7d22-\u63a8\u7406\u5faa\u73af\u4f55\u65f6\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u9759\u6001RAG\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u6311\u6218\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u673a\u5236\u7ea7\u8bca\u65ad\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5728ChemKGMultiHopQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd511\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLM\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u65e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff08\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53c2\u6570\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff09\u3001\u9ec4\u91d1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff08\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u6240\u6709\u8bc1\u636e\uff09\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3RAG\uff08\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u5047\u8bbe\u7cbe\u70bc\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u505c\u6b62\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u8bca\u65ad\u6307\u6807\u5206\u6790\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u8fed\u4ee3RAG\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u9ec4\u91d1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe25.6\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u3002\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u540e\u671f\u8df3\u5931\u8d25\u3001\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fc7\u8f7d\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u7ea0\u6b63\u65e9\u671f\u5047\u8bbe\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u60f3\u8bc1\u636e\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u79d1\u5b66\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u8bca\u65adRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u68c0\u7d22-\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In this work, we first show that a small subset of neurons in LLMs exhibits strong predictive correlations with reasoning correctness. Based on this observation, we propose AdaRAS (Adaptive Reasoning Activation Steering), a lightweight test-time framework that improves reasoning reliability by selectively intervening on neuron activations. AdaRAS identifies Reasoning-Critical Neurons (RCNs) via a polarity-aware mean-difference criterion and adaptively steers their activations during inference, enhancing incorrect reasoning traces while avoiding degradation on already-correct cases. Experiments on 10 mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements, including over 13% gains on AIME-24 and AIME-25. Moreover, AdaRAS exhibits strong transferability across datasets and scalability to stronger models, outperforming post-training methods without additional training or sampling cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "AdaRAS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8LLM\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u91c7\u6837\u6210\u672c", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u80fd\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7387\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u4e2d\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdaRAS\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5747\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\u51c6\u5219\u8bc6\u522b\u63a8\u7406\u5173\u952e\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff08RCNs\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u5f15\u5bfc\u8fd9\u4e9b\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u5df2\u6b63\u786e\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u9000\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5728AIME-24\u548cAIME-25\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc713%\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002AdaRAS\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5f3a\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u66f4\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "AdaRAS\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5e72\u9884\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u91c7\u6837\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Accepted to the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Multilingual Representation Learning (Mexico City) and the AAAI 2025 Workshop on Language Models for Under-Resourced Communities (LM4UC). Code and data available at: https://github.com/Nickcheng123/reflective-translation-mt", "summary": "Low-resource languages such as isiZulu and isiXhosa face persistent challenges in machine translation due to limited parallel data and linguistic resources. Recent advances in large language models suggest that self-reflection, prompting a model to critique and revise its own outputs, can improve reasoning quality and factual consistency. Building on this idea, this paper introduces Reflective Translation, a prompt-based framework in which a model generates an initial translation, produces a structured self-critique, and then uses this reflection to generate a refined translation. The approach is evaluated on English-isiZulu and English-isiXhosa translation using OPUS-100 and NTREX-African, across multiple prompting strategies and confidence thresholds. Results show consistent improvements in both BLEU and COMET scores between first- and second-pass translations, with average gains of up to +0.22 BLEU and +0.18 COMET. Statistical significance testing using paired nonparametric tests confirms that these improvements are robust. The proposed method is model-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, and introduces a reflection-augmented dataset that can support future supervised or analysis-driven work. These findings demonstrate that structured self-reflection is a practical and effective mechanism for improving translation quality in low-resource settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faReflective Translation\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3001\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u81ea\u6211\u6279\u8bc4\u3001\u7136\u540e\u751f\u6210\u6539\u8fdb\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u5728isiZulu\u548cisiXhosa\u7b49\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982isiZulu\u548cisiXhosa\uff09\u7531\u4e8e\u5e73\u884c\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6301\u7eed\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReflective Translation\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u9996\u5148\u751f\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u81ea\u6211\u6279\u8bc4\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53cd\u601d\u751f\u6210\u6539\u8fdb\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u82f1\u8bed-isiZulu\u548c\u82f1\u8bed-isiXhosa\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728OPUS-100\u548cNTREX-African\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u8f6e\u548c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u8f6e\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e4b\u95f4BLEU\u548cCOMET\u5206\u6570\u5747\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u5230+0.22 BLEU\u548c+0.18 COMET\u3002\u914d\u5bf9\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6539\u8fdb\u5177\u6709\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6709\u6548\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u53cd\u601d\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u672a\u6765\u76d1\u7763\u5f0f\u6216\u5206\u6790\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002"}}

In this work, we present ONCOTIMIA, a modular and secure clinical tool designed to integrate generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into oncology workflows and evaluate its application to the automatic completion of lung cancer tumour board forms using large language models (LLMs). The system combines a multi-layer data lake, hybrid relational and vector storage, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a rule-driven adaptive form model to transform unstructured clinical documentation into structured and standardised tumour board records. We assess the performance of six LLMs deployed through AWS Bedrock on ten lung cancer cases, measuring both completion form accuracy and end-to-end latency. The results demonstrate high performance across models, with the best performing configuration achieving an 80% of correct field completion and clinically acceptable response time for most LLMs. Larger and more recent models exhibit best accuracies without incurring prohibitive latency.
