However, existing human-in-the-loop RL (HiL-RL) frameworks often suffer from low sample efficiency, requiring substantial human interventions to achieve convergence and thereby leading to high labor costs. To address this, we propose a sample-efficient real-world human-in-the-loop RL framework named \\method, which requires fewer human intervention by actively selecting informative samples. Specifically, stable reduction of policy entropy enables improved trade-off between exploration and exploitation with higher sample efficiency. We first build influence functions of different samples on the policy entropy, which is efficiently estimated by the covariance of action probabilities and soft advantages of policies. Then we select samples with moderate values of influence functions, where shortcut samples that induce sharp entropy drops and noisy samples with negligible effect are pruned. Extensive experiments on four real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate that \\method achieves a 42.1\\% higher success rate while requiring 10.1\\% fewer human interventions compared to the state-of-the-art HiL-RL method, validating its effectiveness.

Project page at https://remac-async.github.io/", "summary": "Real-time execution is essential for cyber-physical systems such as robots. These systems operate in dynamic real-world environments where even small delays can undermine responsiveness and compromise performance. Asynchronous inference has recently emerged as a system-level paradigm for real-time robot manipulation, enabling the next action chunk to be predicted while the current one is being executed. While this approach achieves real-time responsiveness, naive integration often results in execution failure. Previous methods attributed this failure to inter-chunk discontinuity and developed test-time algorithms to smooth chunk boundaries. In contrast, we identify another critical yet overlooked factor: intra-chunk inconsistency, where the robot's executed action chunk partially misaligns with its current perception. To address this, we propose REMAC, which learns corrective adjustments on the pretrained policy through masked action chunking, enabling the policy to remain resilient under mismatches between intended actions and actual execution during asynchronous inference. In addition, we introduce a prefix-preserved sampling procedure to reinforce inter-chunk continuity. Overall, our method delivers more reliable policies without incurring additional latency.

However, many real-world scalar field mapping applications rely on sensor-equipped mobile robots to collect field measurements, where imperfect localization introduces state uncertainty. Such discrepancies between the estimated and true measurement locations degrade GP mean and covariance estimates. To address this challenge, we propose a method for updating the GP models when improved estimates become available. Leveraging the differentiability of the kernel function, a second-order correction algorithm is developed using the precomputed Jacobians and Hessians of the GP mean and covariance functions for real-time refinement based on measurement location discrepancy data. Simulation results demonstrate improved prediction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to full model retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u9636\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u6620\u5c04\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u5bfc\u81f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5747\u503c\u548c\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e8c\u9636\u4fee\u6b63\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684GP\u5747\u503c\u548c\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u6d77\u68ee\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5dee\u5f02\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5b8c\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u6620\u5c04\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We study whether expert detection can be treated as a learnable skill and improved through structured calibration. We introduce LREAD, a rubric derived from national Korean writing standards and adapted to target micro-level artifacts (e.g., punctuation optionality, spacing behavior, and register shifts). In a three-phase longitudinal blind protocol with Korean linguistics majors, Phase 1 measures intuition-only detection, Phase 2 enforces criterion-level scoring with explicit justifications, and Phase 3 evaluates domain-focused mastery on held-out elementary essays. Across phases, majority-vote accuracy increases from 60% to 100%, accompanied by stronger inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' kappa: -0.09 --> 0.82). Compared to state-of-the-art LLM detectors, calibrated humans rely more on language-specific micro-diagnostics that are not well captured by coarse discourse priors.

Due to near-infinite degrees of freedom, complex dynamics, and heterogeneous patterns, existing vision-based affordance prediction methods often suffer from boundary overflow and fragmented functional regions. To address these issues, we propose TRACER, a Texture-Robust Affordance Chain-of-thought with dEformable-object Refinement framework, which establishes a cross-hierarchical mapping from hierarchical semantic reasoning to appearance-robust and physically consistent functional region refinement. Specifically, a Tree-structured Affordance Chain-of-Thought (TA-CoT) is formulated to decompose high-level task intentions into hierarchical sub-task semantics, providing consistent guidance across various execution stages. To ensure spatial integrity, a Spatial-Constrained Boundary Refinement (SCBR) mechanism is introduced to suppress prediction spillover, guiding the perceptual response to converge toward authentic interaction manifolds. Furthermore, an Interactive Convergence Refinement Flow (ICRF) is developed to aggregate discrete pixels corrupted by appearance noise, significantly enhancing the spatial continuity and physical plausibility of the identified functional regions. Extensive experiments conducted on the Fine-AGDDO15 dataset and a real-world robotic platform demonstrate that TRACER significantly improves affordance grounding precision across diverse textures and patterns inherent to deformable objects. More importantly, it enhances the success rate of long-horizon tasks, effectively bridging the gap between high-level semantic reasoning and low-level physical execution.

While many frameworks and systems for producing synthetic multi-turn tool calling data have been proposed, prior works have frequently assumed that any tool calling interactions will take place in an execution environment that maintains state. When such an environment is available, this is advantageous as it allows for the validity of an interaction to be determined by whether or not the state of the execution environment matches to some prespecified objective. Unfortunately, this does not hold in many real-world tool use settings, e.g., in enterprise settings where data security is of the utmost importance or in cases where tool specifications are synthesized from multiple sources. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a data generation method, DiGiT-TC, that is designed to produce tool calling conversations that have the characteristics of conversations generated through search in a stateful environment. The key to our technique lies in a novel generation pattern that allows our approach to implicitly represent certain tool calls in the user request.

To address this, we introduce TouchGuide, a novel cross-policy visuo-tactile fusion paradigm that fuses modalities within a low-dimensional action space. Specifically, TouchGuide operates in two stages to guide a pre-trained diffusion or flow-matching visuomotor policy at inference time. First, the policy produces a coarse, visually-plausible action using only visual inputs during early sampling. Second, a task-specific Contact Physical Model (CPM) provides tactile guidance to steer and refine the action, ensuring it aligns with realistic physical contact conditions. Trained through contrastive learning on limited expert demonstrations, the CPM provides a tactile-informed feasibility score to steer the sampling process toward refined actions that satisfy physical contact constraints. Furthermore, to facilitate TouchGuide training with high-quality and cost-effective data, we introduce TacUMI, a data collection system. TacUMI achieves a favorable trade-off between precision and affordability; by leveraging rigid fingertips, it obtains direct tactile feedback, thereby enabling the collection of reliable tactile data. Extensive experiments on five challenging contact-rich tasks, such as shoe lacing and chip handover, show that TouchGuide consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art visuo-tactile policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "TouchGuide\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8de8\u7b56\u7565\u89c6\u89c9-\u89e6\u89c9\u878d\u5408\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6216\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89e6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a5\u89e6\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cbe\u7ec6\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u89e6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a5\u89e6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u6574\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTouchGuide\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u878d\u5408\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a1) \u65e9\u671f\u91c7\u6837\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u7c97\u7565\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b2) \u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b(CPM)\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e6\u89c9\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e6\u89c9\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5206\u6570\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f00\u53d1TacUMI\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u521a\u6027\u6307\u5c16\u83b7\u53d6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89e6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u7cfb\u978b\u5e26\u3001\u82af\u7247\u4ea4\u63a5\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTouchGuide\u59cb\u7ec8\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u89e6\u89c9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "TouchGuide\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u548c\u89e6\u89c9\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a5\u89e6\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Within the VLA literature, efficiency has been extensively studied at the token level, such as visual token pruning. In contrast, systematic transformer layer reduction has received limited attention and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been explored for flow-based VLA models under knowledge distillation. In this work, we propose Shallow-pi, a principled knowledge distillation framework that aggressively reduces the transformer depth of both the VLM backbone and the flow-based action head, compressing the model from 18 to 6 layers. Shallow-pi achieves over two times faster inference with less than one percent absolute drop in success rate on standard manipulation benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art performance among reduced VLA models. Crucially, we validate our approach through industrial-scale real-world experiments on Jetson Orin and Jetson Thor across multiple robot platforms, including humanoid systems, in complex and dynamic manipulation scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Shallow-pi\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684transformer\u5c42\u6570\u4ece18\u5c42\u538b\u7f29\u52306\u5c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b02\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0d\u52301%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u65f6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728token\u7ea7\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u89c9token\u526a\u679d\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684transformer\u5c42\u51cf\u5c11\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5c1a\u672a\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u63a2\u7d22", "method": "\u63d0\u51faShallow-pi\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6fc0\u8fdb\u5730\u51cf\u5c11VLM\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5934\u7684transformer\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece18\u5c42\u538b\u7f29\u52306\u5c42", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc72\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u64cd\u4f5c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7edd\u5bf9\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0d\u52301%\uff0c\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5728Jetson Orin\u548cJetson Thor\u7b49\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4eba\u5f62\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u64cd\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528", "conclusion": "Shallow-pi\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684transformer\u5c42\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u4e3aVLA\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u90e8\u7f72"}}

However, due to their predominant reliance on visual modalities, they fundamentally lack the physical intuition required for contact-rich tasks that require precise force regulation and physical reasoning. Existing attempts to incorporate vision-based tactile sensing into VLA models typically treat tactile inputs as auxiliary visual textures, thereby overlooking the underlying correlation between surface deformation and interaction dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose a paradigm shift from tactile-vision alignment to tactile-force alignment. Here, we introduce TaF-VLA, a framework that explicitly grounds high-dimensional tactile observations in physical interaction forces. To facilitate this, we develop an automated tactile-force data acquisition device and curate the TaF-Dataset, comprising over 10 million synchronized tactile observations, 6-axis force/torque, and matrix force map. To align sequential tactile observations with interaction forces, the central component of our approach is the Tactile-Force Adapter (TaF-Adapter), a tactile sensor encoder that extracts discretized latent information for encoding tactile observations. This mechanism ensures that the learned representations capture history-dependent, noise-insensitive physical dynamics rather than static visual textures. Finally, we integrate this force-aligned encoder into a VLA backbone. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that TaF-VLA policy significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tactile-vision-aligned and vision-only baselines on contact-rich tasks, verifying its ability to achieve robust, force-aware manipulation through cross-modal physical reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "TaF-VLA\uff1a\u5c06\u89e6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u529b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684VLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e6\u89c9-\u529b\u9002\u914d\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a5\u89e6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63a5\u89e6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7269\u7406\u76f4\u89c9\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u529b\u8c03\u8282\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u89e6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u89c6\u89c9\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8868\u9762\u53d8\u5f62\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5173\u8054\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u89e6\u89c9-\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u89e6\u89c9-\u529b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u89e6\u89c9-\u529b\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b1000\u4e07+\u540c\u6b65\u89e6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u30016\u8f74\u529b/\u626d\u77e9\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u529b\u56fe\u7684TaF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u89e6\u89c9-\u529b\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff08TaF-Adapter\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5e8f\u5217\u89e6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u529b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u89e6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTaF-VLA\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89e6\u89c9-\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u529b\u611f\u77e5\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e6\u89c9-\u529b\u5bf9\u9f50\u8303\u5f0f\uff0cTaF-VLA\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ef4\u89e6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u529b\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u4f7fVLA\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u5386\u53f2\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u7684\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9759\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a5\u89e6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Our analysis reveals that LLMs possess latent reasoning capabilities that can be unlocked when conditioned on explicit plans from a teacher model; however, runtime reliance on external guidance is often impractical due to latency and availability constraints. To bridge this gap, we propose PILOT (Planning via Internalized Latent Optimization Trajectories), a non-invasive framework designed to internalize the strategic oversight of large models into intrinsic Latent Guidance. Instead of altering backbone weights, PILOT employs a lightweight Hyper-Network to synthesize a query-conditioned Latent Guidance vector. This vector acts as an internal steering mechanism, guiding the model's representations toward optimal reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on mathematical and coding benchmarks demonstrate that PILOT effectively stabilizes reasoning trajectories, consistently outperforming strong baselines (e.g., +8.9% on MATH500) with negligible inference latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "PILOT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u5408\u6210\u67e5\u8be2\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6307\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6218\u7565\u76d1\u7763\u5185\u5316\u5230\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u4e3b\u5e72\u6743\u91cd\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5236\u5b9a\u5168\u5c40\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\u867d\u7136LLMs\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u8ba1\u5212\u6765\u89e3\u9501\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6307\u5bfc\u901a\u5e38\u56e0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u9650\u5236\u800c\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPILOT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u5408\u6210\u67e5\u8be2\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6307\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u8be5\u5411\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u90e8\u8f6c\u5411\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u671d\u5411\u6700\u4f18\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u4e3b\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPILOT\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08\u5982\u5728MATH500\u4e0a\u63d0\u53478.9%\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "PILOT\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6218\u7565\u76d1\u7763\u80fd\u529b\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We investigate whether general-purpose large language model (LLM) agent frameworks, originally developed for software engineering, can serve as an alternative control paradigm for embodied manipulation. We introduce FAEA (Frontier Agent as Embodied Agent), which applies an LLM agent framework directly to embodied manipulation without modification. Using the same iterative reasoning that enables software agents to debug code, FAEA enables embodied agents to reason through manipulation strategies. We evaluate an unmodified frontier agent, Claude Agent SDK, across the LIBERO, ManiSkill3, and MetaWorld benchmarks. With privileged environment state access, FAEA achieves success rates of 84.9%, 85.7%, and 96%, respectively. This level of task success approaches that of VLA models trained with less than 100 demonstrations per task, without requiring demonstrations or fine-tuning. With one round of human feedback as an optional optimization, performance increases to 88.2% on LIBERO. This demonstration-free capability has immediate practical value: FAEA can autonomously explore novel scenarios in simulation and generate successful trajectories for training data augmentation in embodied learning. Our results indicate that general-purpose agents are sufficient for a class of manipulation tasks dominated by deliberative, task-level planning. This opens a path for robotics systems to leverage actively maintained agent infrastructure and benefit directly from ongoing advances in frontier models.

However, existing hallucination detection methods generally operate under unrealistic assumptions, i.e., either requiring expensive intensive sampling strategies for consistency checks or white-box LLM states, which are unavailable or inefficient in common API-based scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel efficient zero-shot metric called Lowest Span Confidence (LSC) for hallucination detection under minimal resource assumptions, only requiring a single forward with output probabilities. Concretely, LSC evaluates the joint likelihood of semantically coherent spans via a sliding window mechanism. By identifying regions of lowest marginal confidence across variable-length n-grams, LSC could well capture local uncertainty patterns strongly correlated with factual inconsistency. Importantly, LSC can mitigate the dilution effect of perplexity and the noise sensitivity of minimum token probability, offering a more robust estimate of factual uncertainty. Extensive experiments across multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs and diverse benchmarks show that LSC consistently outperforms existing zero-shot baselines, delivering strong detection performance even under resource-constrained conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLSC\uff08\u6700\u4f4e\u8de8\u5ea6\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u8de8\u5ea6\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f3c\u7136\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff1a\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u767d\u76d2LLM\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5e38\u89c1\u7684API\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u6216\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLSC\uff08\u6700\u4f4e\u8de8\u5ea6\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff09\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u673a\u5236\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u8de8\u5ea6\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f3c\u7136\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u53d8\u957f\u5ea6n-gram\u4e2d\u6700\u4f4e\u8fb9\u9645\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aSOTA LLM\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLSC\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LSC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7f13\u89e3\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u7684\u7a00\u91ca\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u4ee4\u724c\u6982\u7387\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002"}}

However, current vision-based solutions are limited by the inherent constraints of optical sensors, while radio-frequency (RF) approaches, which can reveal intrinsic material properties, have received growing attention. Despite this progress, RF-based material identification remains hindered by the lack of large-scale public datasets and the limited benchmarking of learning-based approaches. In this work, we present RF-MatID, the first open-source, large-scale, wide-band, and geometry-diverse RF dataset for fine-grained material identification. RF-MatID includes 16 fine-grained categories grouped into 5 superclasses, spanning a broad frequency range from 4 to 43.5 GHz, and comprises 142k samples in both frequency- and time-domain representations. The dataset systematically incorporates controlled geometry perturbations, including variations in incidence angle and stand-off distance.

We propose STORM (Slot-based Task-aware Object-centric Representation for robotic Manipulation), a lightweight object-centric adaptation module that augments frozen visual foundation models with a small set of semantic-aware slots for robotic manipulation. Rather than retraining large backbones, STORM employs a multi-phase training strategy: object-centric slots are first stabilized through visual--semantic pretraining using language embeddings, then jointly adapted with a downstream manipulation policy. This staged learning prevents degenerate slot formation and preserves semantic consistency while aligning perception with task objectives. Experiments on object discovery benchmarks and simulated manipulation tasks show that STORM improves generalization to visual distractors, and control performance compared to directly using frozen foundation model features or training object-centric representations end-to-end.

Studies show that, under homogeneous agents and uniform belief updates, debate preserves expected correctness and therefore cannot reliably improve outcomes. Drawing on findings from human deliberation and collective decision-making, we identify two key mechanisms missing from vanilla MAD: (i) diversity of initial viewpoints and (ii) explicit, calibrated confidence communication. We propose two lightweight interventions. First, a diversity-aware initialisation that selects a more diverse pool of candidate answers, increasing the likelihood that a correct hypothesis is present at the start of debate. Second, a confidence-modulated debate protocol in which agents express calibrated confidence and condition their updates on others' confidence. We show theoretically that diversity-aware initialisation improves the prior probability of MAD success without changing the underlying update dynamics, while confidence-modulated updates enable debate to systematically drift to the correct hypothesis. Empirically, across six reasoning-oriented QA benchmarks, our methods consistently outperform vanilla MAD and majority vote. Our results connect human deliberation with LLM-based debate and demonstrate that simple, principled modifications can substantially enhance debate effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8c03\u5236\u8fa9\u8bba\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfMAD\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406QA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\uff08MAD\uff09\u867d\u7136\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6765\u63d0\u5347LLM\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u5982\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u548c\u5747\u5300\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fa9\u8bba\u53ea\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u671f\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u6539\u8fdb\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u5ba1\u8bae\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edfMAD\u7f3a\u5c11\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u521d\u59cb\u89c2\u70b9\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u660e\u786e\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6c9f\u901a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u591a\u6837\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff1a\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5019\u9009\u7b54\u6848\u6c60\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u8fa9\u8bba\u5f00\u59cb\u65f6\u6b63\u786e\u5047\u8bbe\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8c03\u5236\u8fa9\u8bba\u534f\u8bae\uff1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8868\u8fbe\u6821\u51c6\u540e\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u4ed6\u4eba\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u66f4\u65b0\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86MAD\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\u800c\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u5e95\u5c42\u66f4\u65b0\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8c03\u5236\u66f4\u65b0\u4f7f\u8fa9\u8bba\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5411\u6b63\u786e\u5047\u8bbe\u6f02\u79fb\u3002\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u5bfc\u5411\u7684QA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfMAD\u548c\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u5ba1\u8bae\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8fa9\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8fa9\u8bba\u6548\u679c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Although numerous analog field trials address these goals, comparing their results remains challenging because of differences in robot platforms and experimental setups. These missions typically assess performance using selected, scenario-specific engineering metrics that fail to establish a clear link between field performance and science-driven objectives. In this paper, we address this gap by deriving a structured framework of KPI from three realistic multi-robot lunar scenarios reflecting scientific objectives and operational constraints. Our framework emphasizes scenario-dependent priorities in efficiency, robustness, and precision, and is explicitly designed for practical applicability in field deployments. We validated the framework in a multi-robot field test and found it practical and easy to apply for efficiency- and robustness-related KPI, whereas precision-oriented KPI require reliable ground-truth data that is not always feasible to obtain in outdoor analog environments.

Despite rapid progress in language models, we still lack a clear way to understand how their abilities in these interpersonal domains compare to those of humans. We introduce HEART, the first-ever framework that directly compares humans and LLMs on the same multi-turn emotional-support conversations. For each dialogue history, we pair human and model responses and evaluate them through blinded human raters and an ensemble of LLM-as-judge evaluators. All assessments follow a rubric grounded in interpersonal communication science across five dimensions: Human Alignment, Empathic Responsiveness, Attunement, Resonance, and Task-Following. HEART uncovers striking behavioral patterns. Several frontier models approach or surpass the average human responses in perceived empathy and consistency. At the same time, humans maintain advantages in adaptive reframing, tension-naming, and nuanced tone shifts, particularly in adversarial turns. Human and LLM-as-judge preferences align on about 80 percent of pairwise comparisons, matching inter-human agreement, and their written rationales emphasize similar HEART dimensions. This pattern suggests an emerging convergence in the criteria used to assess supportive quality. By placing humans and models on equal footing, HEART reframes supportive dialogue as a distinct capability axis, separable from general reasoning or linguistic fluency. It provides a unified empirical foundation for understanding where model-generated support aligns with human social judgment, where it diverges, and how affective conversational competence scales with model size.", "AI": {"tldr": "HEART\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u6b21\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eLLM\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5171\u60c5\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u63a5\u8fd1\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e73\u5747\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u91cd\u6784\u3001\u7d27\u5f20\u547d\u540d\u548c\u7ec6\u5fae\u8bed\u6c14\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4eba\u9645\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u9886\u57df\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165HEART\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u914d\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f2\u5ba1\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u5458\u548cLLM-as-judge\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u9075\u5faa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u9645\u6c9f\u901a\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u4e94\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u5171\u60c5\u54cd\u5e94\u3001\u8c03\u8c10\u3001\u5171\u9e23\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u9075\u5faa\u3002", "result": "\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u5171\u60c5\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u63a5\u8fd1\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e73\u5747\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u91cd\u6784\u3001\u7d27\u5f20\u547d\u540d\u548c\u7ec6\u5fae\u8bed\u6c14\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u9762\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\uff1b\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM-as-judge\u5728\u7ea680%\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2d\u504f\u597d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "HEART\u5c06\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u8bdd\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u63a8\u7406\u6216\u8bed\u8a00\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u652f\u6301\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4ea4\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5951\u5408\u4e0e\u5206\u6b67\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u80fd\u529b\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This paper presents a scalable alternative: high-accuracy whole-body touch localization via vibro-acoustic sensing. By equipping a robotic hand with seven low-cost piezoelectric microphones and leveraging an Audio Spectrogram Transformer, we decode the vibrational signatures generated during physical interaction. Extensive evaluation across stationary and dynamic tasks reveals a localization error of under 5 mm in static conditions. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the distinct influence of material properties: stiff materials (e.g., metal) excel in impulse response localization due to sharp, high-bandwidth responses, whereas textured materials (e.g., wood) provide superior friction-based features for trajectory tracking.

However, current evaluations lack effective methodologies to measure this structural fidelity without costly human intervention, as traditional text metrics fail to detect semantic drift in code-like outputs. This paper proposes Table-BiEval, a novel approach based on a human-free, self-supervised evaluation framework, to assess LLMs performance quantitatively. By leveraging deterministic Intermediate Representations, our framework calculates Content Semantic Accuracy and Normalized Tree Edit Distance to decouple structure from content. Also, it empirically evaluates 15 state-of-the-art LLMs across dual topological dimensions-hierarchical structures and flat tables. The results reveal substantial variability, highlighting that mid-sized models can surprisingly outperform larger counterparts in structural efficiency and confirming that deep recursive nesting remains a universal bottleneck for current architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Table-BiEval\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u8bed\u4e49\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6811\u7f16\u8f91\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u683c\u5f0f\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\uff09\u5e76\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u8868\u683c\u4fe1\u606f\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u53ef\u8bfb\u89c4\u8303\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u8861\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u672c\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ee3\u7801\u7c7b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTable-BiEval\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5185\u5bb9\u8bed\u4e49\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6811\u7f16\u8f91\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u89e3\u8026\u3002\u5728\u53cc\u91cd\u62d3\u6251\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5e73\u9762\u8868\u683c\uff09\u4e0a\u5bf915\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff1a\u4e2d\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u6df1\u5ea6\u9012\u5f52\u5d4c\u5957\u4ecd\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u666e\u904d\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "Table-BiEval\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u8f6c\u6362\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

However, most existing multi-robot collaboration methods rely on extensive task-specific training, which limits their adaptability to new or diverse scenarios. Recent research leverages the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enable more flexible collaboration without specialized training. Yet, current LLM-empowered approaches remain inefficient: when confronted with identical or similar tasks, they must replan from scratch because they omit task-level similarities. To address this limitation, we propose MeCo, a similarity-aware multi-robot collaboration framework that applies the principle of ``cache and reuse'' (a.k.a., memoization) to reduce redundant computation. Unlike simple task repetition, identifying and reusing solutions for similar but not identical tasks is far more challenging, particularly in multi-robot settings. To this end, MeCo introduces a new similarity testing method that retrieves previously solved tasks with high relevance, enabling effective plan reuse without re-invoking LLMs. Furthermore, we present MeCoBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate performance on similar-task collaboration scenarios. Experimental results show that MeCo substantially reduces planning costs and improves success rates compared with state-of-the-art approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "MeCo\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\"\u7f13\u5b58\u4e0e\u91cd\u7528\"\u539f\u5219\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cd\u7528\u5148\u524d\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8c03\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u89c4\u5212\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u76f8\u540c\u6216\u76f8\u4f3c\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u76f8\u4f3c\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMeCo\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u5148\u524d\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u91cd\u7528\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8c03\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8fd8\u521b\u5efa\u4e86MeCoBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f8\u4f3c\u4efb\u52a1\u534f\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cMeCo\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u89c4\u5212\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "MeCo\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u7f13\u5b58\u91cd\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the boundaries of their capabilities in automated formulation and problem solving remain poorly understood, particularly when extending to complex, real-world tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose OPT-ENGINE, an extensible benchmark framework designed to evaluate LLMs on optimization modeling with controllable and scalable difficulty levels. OPT-ENGINE spans 10 canonical tasks across operations research, with five Linear Programming and five Mixed-Integer Programming. Utilizing OPT-ENGINE, we conduct an extensive study of LLMs' reasoning capabilities, addressing two critical questions: 1.) Do LLMs' performance remain robust when generalizing to out-of-distribution optimization tasks that scale in complexity beyond current benchmark levels? and 2.) At what stage, from problem interpretation to solution generation, do current LLMs encounter the most significant bottlenecks? Our empirical results yield two key insights: first, tool-integrated reasoning with external solvers exhibits significantly higher robustness as task complexity escalates, while pure-text reasoning reaches a ceiling; second, the automated formulation of constraints constitutes the primary performance bottleneck. These findings provide actionable guidance for developing next-generation LLMs for advanced optimization.

Existing methods for locomotion and whole-body control work well for position-based control with environment-specific heuristics (e.g., reward shaping, curriculum design, and manual initialization), but are less effective for torque-based control, where sufficiently exploring the action space and obtaining informative gradient signals for training is significantly more difficult. We introduce Growing Policy Optimization (GPO), a training framework that applies a time-varying action transformation to restrict the effective action space in the early stage, thereby encouraging more effective data collection and policy learning, and then progressively expands it to enhance exploration and achieve higher expected return. We prove that this transformation preserves the PPO update rule and introduces only bounded, vanishing gradient distortion, thereby ensuring stable training. We evaluate GPO on both quadruped and hexapod robots, including zero-shot deployment of simulation-trained policies on hardware. Policies trained with GPO consistently achieve better performance. These results suggest that GPO provides a general, environment-agnostic optimization framework for learning legged locomotion.", "AI": {"tldr": "GPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u53d8\u52a8\u4f5c\u53d8\u6362\u9650\u5236\u65e9\u671f\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6709\u6548\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u9010\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u626d\u77e9\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u4f5c\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u548c\u6709\u9650\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u626d\u77e9\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u83b7\u53d6\u6709\u6548\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u66f4\u52a0\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGrowing Policy Optimization (GPO)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u53d8\u52a8\u4f5c\u53d8\u6362\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e9\u671f\u9650\u5236\u6709\u6548\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u9010\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u8db3\u548c\u516d\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30GPO\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u90e8\u7f72\u4eff\u771f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002GPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u59cb\u7ec8\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u817f\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u7684\u73af\u5883\u65e0\u5173\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "GPO\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u53d8\u52a8\u4f5c\u53d8\u6362\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u626d\u77e9\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86PPO\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

To explore LLM's potential in assisting scientific review, this study examined ChatGPT-5, Gemini-3-Pro, and Claude-Sonnet-4.5's consistency and reliability in evaluating abstracts compared to one another and to human reviewers. Methods: 160 abstracts from a local conference were graded by human reviewers and three LLMs using one rubric. Composite score distributions across three LLMs and fourteen reviewers were examined. Inter-rater reliability was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for within-AI reliability and AI-human concordance. Bland-Altman plots were examined for visual agreement patterns and systematic bias. Results: LLMs achieved good-to-excellent agreement with each other (ICCs: 0.59-0.87). ChatGPT and Claude reached moderate agreement with human reviewers on overall quality and content-specific criteria, with ICCs ~.45-.60 for composite, impression, clarity, objective, and results. They exhibited fair agreement on subjective dimensions, with ICC ranging from 0.23-0.38 for impact, engagement, and applicability. Gemini showed fair agreement on half criteria and no reliability on impact and applicability. Three LLMs showed acceptable or negligible mean difference (ChatGPT=0.24, Gemini=0.42, Claude=-0.02) from the human mean composite scores. Discussion: LLMs could process abstracts in batches with moderate agreement with human experts on overall quality and objective criteria. With appropriate process architecture, they can apply a rubric consistently across volumes of abstracts exceeding feasibility for a human rater. The weaker performance on subjective dimensions indicates that AI should serve a complementary role in evaluation, while human expertise remains essential.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b66\u672f\u6458\u8981\u65f6\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5458\u5728\u5ba2\u89c2\u6807\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e2d\u7b49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u8865\u5145\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u534f\u52a9\u79d1\u5b66\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5b66\u672f\u6458\u8981\u65f6\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528ChatGPT-5\u3001Gemini-3-Pro\u548cClaude-Sonnet-4.5\u8bc4\u4f30160\u4e2a\u4f1a\u8bae\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u4e0e14\u540d\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5458\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5185\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u548cBland-Altman\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fbe\u5230\u826f\u597d\u5230\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08ICC: 0.59-0.87\uff09\uff1bChatGPT\u548cClaude\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5ba2\u89c2\u6807\u51c6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5458\u8fbe\u5230\u4e2d\u7b49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08ICC: ~.45-.60\uff09\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u3001\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3001\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff09\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8f83\u5dee\uff08ICC: 0.23-0.38\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u80fd\u591f\u6279\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u6458\u8981\u5e76\u5728\u5ba2\u89c2\u6807\u51c6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fbe\u5230\u4e2d\u7b49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u8865\u5145\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

This paper presents a computational method for estimating joint positions from measured tendon displacements and tensions. An efficient kinematic modeling framework for anthropomorphic hands is first introduced based on the Denavit-Hartenberg convention. Using a simplified tendon model, a system of nonlinear equations relating tendon states to joint positions is derived and solved via a nonlinear optimization approach.

However, LLM-generated responses often suffer from hallucinations, unfaithful statements lacking reliable references. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks enhance LLM responses by incorporating external references but also introduce new forms of hallucination due to complex interactions between the retriever and generator. To address these challenges, researchers have explored attribution-based techniques that ensure responses are verifiably supported by retrieved content. Despite progress, a unified pipeline for these techniques, along with a clear taxonomy and systematic comparison of their strengths and weaknesses, remains lacking. A well-defined taxonomy is essential for identifying specific failure modes within RAG systems, while comparative analysis helps practitioners choose appropriate solutions based on hallucination types and application context. This survey investigates how attribution-based techniques are used within RAG systems to mitigate hallucinations and addresses the gap by: (i) outlining a taxonomy of hallucination types in RAG systems, (ii) presenting a unified pipeline for attribution techniques, (iii) reviewing techniques based on the hallucinations they target, and (iv) discussing strengths and weaknesses with practical guidelines. This work offers insights for future research and practical use of attribution techniques in RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u5728RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7f13\u89e3\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RAG\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u6280\u672f\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0cRAG\u6846\u67b6\u867d\u7136\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u5f15\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5f52\u56e0\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u6e05\u6670\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc6\u522bRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u5e2e\u52a9\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u6839\u636e\u5e7b\u89c9\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51faRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e7b\u89c9\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff1b2) \u6784\u5efa\u5f52\u56e0\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1b3) \u6839\u636e\u9488\u5bf9\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u7c7b\u578b\u56de\u987e\u76f8\u5173\u6280\u672f\uff1b4) \u8ba8\u8bba\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5357\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86RAG\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u5f52\u56e0\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u5357\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5f52\u56e0\u6280\u672f\u7684\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7f13\u89e3LLM\u5728RAG\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Unlike conventional automation that relies on labor-intensive 2D labeling, our framework leverages reusable warm-up trajectories to extract implicit spatial information, thereby achieving calibration-aware, depth-resolved perception without the need for external fiducials or manual depth annotation. By explicitly characterizing residuals from observation and calibration models, the system establishes a task-space error budget from recorded warm-ups. The uncertainty budget yields a lateral closed-loop accuracy of approx. 49 micrometers at 95% confidence (worst-case testing subset) and a depth accuracy of <= 291 micrometers at 95% confidence bound during large in-plane moves. In a within-subject user study (N=8), the learned agent reduces overall NASA-TLX workload by 77.1% relative to the simple steady-hand assistance baseline. These results demonstrate that the weakly supervised agent improves the reliability of microscope-guided biomedical micromanipulation without introducing complex setup requirements, offering a practical framework for microscope-guided intervention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u6807\u5b9a\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5bfc\u7eb3\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u70ed\u8eab\u8f68\u8ff9\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5fae\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7a33\u6001\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f9d\u8d56\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u76842D\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u8bb0\u6216\u624b\u52a8\u6df1\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u64cd\u4f5c\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5fae\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u70ed\u8eab\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u53d6\u9690\u542b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6807\u5b9a\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u8fa8\u611f\u77e5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u5f81\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u6807\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\uff0c\u4ece\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u70ed\u8eab\u8f68\u8ff9\u5efa\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bef\u5dee\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bfc\u7eb3\u63a7\u5236", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a2a\u5411\u95ed\u73af\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ea649\u5fae\u7c73\uff0895%\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u6700\u574f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b50\u96c6\uff09\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u2264291\u5fae\u7c73\uff0895%\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff09\u3002\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u5c06NASA-TLX\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8377\u964d\u4f4e77.1%\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u7a33\u6001\u624b\u8f85\u52a9\u57fa\u7ebf\uff09", "conclusion": "\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4ee3\u7406\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5fae\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8377\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6"}}

The methodology encompasses several key steps: defining initial and target conditions, structuring tasks and subtasks, planning their sequence, representing task-related data in a knowledge graph, and designing the mission using a high-level language.

We propose a novel method for sim-to-real transfer of reinforcement learning policies, based on a reinterpretation of neural style transfer from image processing to synthesise novel training data from unpaired unlabelled real world datasets. We employ a variational autoencoder to jointly learn self-supervised feature representations for style transfer and generate weakly paired source-target trajectories to improve physical realism of synthesised trajectories. We demonstrate the application of our approach based on the case study of robot cutting of unknown materials. Compared to baseline methods, including our previous work, CycleGAN, and conditional variational autoencoder-based time series translation, our approach achieves improved task completion time and behavioural stability with minimal real-world data.

When votes result in a perfect tie, a symbolic ensemble combining five narrative similarity signals (lexical overlap, semantic embeddings, story grammar structure, event chain alignment, and narrative tension curves) provides the final decision. Our cascade architecture achieves 81% accuracy on the development set, demonstrating that selective deferral to symbolic methods can enhance neural predictions on genuinely ambiguous narrative comparisons.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7528\u4e8e\u53d9\u4e8b\u6545\u4e8b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6295\u7968\u4e0e\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d9\u4e8b\u5206\u6790\u96c6\u6210\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b26\u53f7\u5e73\u5c40\u51b3\u80dc\u5668", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u53d9\u4e8b\u6545\u4e8b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5230\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u795e\u7ecf\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u771f\u6b63\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0", "method": "\u6df7\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a\u795e\u7ecf\u90e8\u5206\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u8f6e\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6295\u7968\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u8d85\u591a\u6570\u9608\u503c\uff1b\u7b26\u53f7\u90e8\u5206\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d9\u4e8b\u5206\u6790\u96c6\u6210\uff08\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cd\u53e0\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u6545\u4e8b\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u94fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u53d9\u4e8b\u5f20\u529b\u66f2\u7ebf\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e73\u5c40\u51b3\u80dc\u5668", "result": "\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523081%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5230\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u795e\u7ecf\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u53d9\u4e8b\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6295\u7968\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u5e73\u5c40\u51b3\u80dc\u5668\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u53d9\u4e8b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd"}}

This paper introduces CodedLang, a dataset of 7,744 Chinese Google Maps reviews, including 900 reviews with span-level annotations of coded language. We developed a seven-class taxonomy that captures common encoding strategies, including phonetic, orthographic, and cross-lingual substitutions. We benchmarked language models on coded language detection, classification, and review rating prediction. Results show that even strong models can fail to identify or understand coded language. Because many coded expressions rely on pronunciation-based strategies, we further conducted a phonetic analysis of coded and decoded forms.

We formalize the Contradiction-Preservation Principle, which requires that genuinely ambiguous expressions maintain non-zero entropy in their state representations, and develop extraction protocols using existing Large Language Models as interpretation generators. Empirical validation across 68 test sentences spanning lexical, structural, and pragmatic ambiguity demonstrates that our mapping achieves mean Shannon entropy H(S) = 1.087 bits for ambiguous inputs while baseline single-interpretation approaches yield H(S) = 0.000.

In practice, identical prompts do not always produce identical outputs, even when temperature and other decoding parameters are fixed. In this work, we conduct repeated-run experiments to empirically quantify baseline behavioural drift, defined as output variability observed when the same prompt is issued multiple times under operator-free conditions. We evaluate two publicly accessible models, gpt-4o-mini and llama3.1-8b, across five prompt categories using exact repeats, perturbed inputs, and reuse modes at temperatures of 0.0 and 0.7. Drift is measured using unique output fractions, lexical similarity, and word count statistics, enabling direct comparison across models, prompting modes, and deployment types. The results show that nondeterminism persists even at temperature 0.0, with distinct variability patterns by model size, deployment, and prompt type. We situate these findings within existing work on concept drift, behavioural drift, and infrastructure-induced nondeterminism, discuss the limitations of lexical metrics, and highlight emerging semantic approaches. By establishing a systematic empirical baseline in the absence of stabilisation techniques, this study provides a reference point for evaluating future drift mitigation and control methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u590d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff08\u884c\u4e3a\u6f02\u79fb\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6e29\u5ea6\u8bbe\u4e3a0.0\u65f6\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u6f02\u79fb\u6a21\u5f0f\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u7c7b\u578b\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u89e3\u7801\u53c2\u6570\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u76f8\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u4e5f\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u540c\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8f93\u51fa\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff08\u884c\u4e3a\u6f02\u79fb\uff09\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u7ebf\u53c2\u8003\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9gpt-4o-mini\u548cllama3.1-8b\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u590d\u8fd0\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e94\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7cbe\u786e\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u6270\u52a8\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u6e29\u5ea60.0\u548c0.7\u4e0b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u552f\u4e00\u8f93\u51fa\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u548c\u8bcd\u6570\u7edf\u8ba1\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6e29\u5ea60.0\u65f6\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6f02\u79fb\u6a21\u5f0f\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u7c7b\u578b\u800c\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u8bcd\u6c47\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u7c7b\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u884c\u4e3a\u6f02\u79fb\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u7f13\u89e3\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u8bcd\u6c47\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u65b0\u5174\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks, however, primarily test a angent's ability to passively retrieve isolated facts in response to explicit questions. They fail to evaluate the more crucial capability of actively applying memory to execute tasks. To address this gap, we introduce \\textsc{Mem2ActBench}, a benchmark for evaluating whether agents can proactively leverage long-term memory to execute tool-based actions by selecting appropriate tools and grounding their parameters. The benchmark simulates persistent assistant usage, where users mention the same topic across long, interrupted interactions and expect previously established preferences and task states to be implicitly applied. We build the dataset with an automated pipeline that merges heterogeneous sources (ToolACE, BFCL, Oasst1), resolves conflicts via consistency modeling, and synthesizes 2,029 sessions with 12 user--assistant--tool turns on average. From these memory chains, a reverse-generation method produces 400 tool-use tasks, with human evaluation confirming 91.3\\% are strongly memory-dependent.

Under review at Information Sciences", "summary": "The rapid progress of large language models has enabled the generation of text that closely resembles human writing, creating challenges for authenticity verification in education, publishing, and digital security. Detecting AI-generated text has therefore become a crucial technical and ethical issue. This paper presents a comprehensive study of AI-generated text detection based on large-scale corpora and novel training strategies. We introduce a 1-billion-token corpus of human-authored texts spanning multiple genres and a 1.9-billion-token corpus of AI-generated texts produced by prompting a variety of LLMs across diverse domains. Using these resources, we develop and evaluate numerous detection models and propose two novel training paradigms: Per LLM and Per LLM family fine-tuning.

We identify and characterize two key failure modes: the multilingual transfer bottleneck (correct language, incorrect task response) and the language consistency bottleneck (correct task response, wrong language). To systematically surface these issues, we design a four-scenario evaluation protocol spanning MMLU, MGSM, and XQuAD benchmarks. To probe these issues with interpretability, we extend logit lens analysis to track language probabilities layer by layer and compute cross-lingual semantic similarity of hidden states. The results reveal a three-phase internal structure: early layers align inputs into a shared semantic space, middle layers perform task reasoning, and late layers drive language-specific generation. Guided by these insights, we introduce selective fine-tuning of only the final layers responsible for language control. On Qwen-3-32B and Bloom-7.1B, this method achieves over 98 percent language consistency across six languages while fine-tuning only 3-5 percent of parameters, without sacrificing task accuracy. Importantly, this result is nearly identical to that of full-scope fine-tuning (for example, above 98 percent language consistency for both methods across all prompt scenarios) but uses a fraction of the computational resources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to leverage layer-localization of language control for efficient multilingual adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u540e\u51e0\u5c42\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5fae\u8c033-5%\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u523098%\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7ecf\u8fc7\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u65e0\u6cd5\u6309\u7167\u9884\u671f\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u56de\u7b54\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u79fb\u74f6\u9888\uff08\u6b63\u786e\u8bed\u8a00\u4f46\u4efb\u52a1\u56de\u7b54\u9519\u8bef\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u74f6\u9888\uff08\u6b63\u786e\u4efb\u52a1\u56de\u7b54\u4f46\u8bed\u8a00\u9519\u8bef\uff09\u3002", "method": "1. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u56db\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6MMLU\u3001MGSM\u548cXQuAD\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1b2. \u6269\u5c55logit lens\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9010\u5c42\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u6982\u7387\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff1b3. \u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u665a\u671f\u5c42\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u8d1f\u8d23\u8bed\u8a00\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6700\u540e\u51e0\u5c42\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen-3-32B\u548cBloom-7.1B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c033-5%\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u516d\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u8d85\u8fc798%\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u5728\u6240\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u90fd\u8fbe\u523098%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5c42\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u6700\u540e\u51e0\u5c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose TAIGR (Takeaway Argumentation Inference with Grounded References), a structured framework designed to analyze influencer discourse, which operates in three stages: (1) identifying the core influencer recommendation--takeaway; (2) constructing an argumentation graph that captures influencer justification for the takeaway; (3) performing factor graph-based probabilistic inference to validate the takeaway.

We present a neurosymbolic framework that combines LLMs with SMT solvers to produce verification-guided answers through iterative refinement. Our approach decomposes LLM outputs into atomic claims, autoformalizes them into first-order logic, and verifies their logical consistency using automated theorem proving. We introduce three key innovations: (1) multi-model consensus via formal semantic equivalence checking to ensure logic-level alignment between candidates, eliminating the syntactic bias of surface-form metrics, (2) semantic routing that directs different claim types to appropriate verification strategies: symbolic solvers for logical claims and LLM ensembles for commonsense reasoning, and (3) precise logical error localization via Minimal Correction Subsets (MCS), which pinpoint the exact subset of claims to revise, transforming binary failure signals into actionable feedback. Our framework classifies claims by their logical status and aggregates multiple verification signals into a unified score with variance-based penalty. The system iteratively refines answers using structured feedback until acceptance criteria are met or convergence is achieved. This hybrid approach delivers formal guarantees where possible and consensus verification elsewhere, advancing trustworthy AI.

Unlike literal phrases, FFEs are culturally grounded, largely non-compositional, and conventionally fixed, making them especially vulnerable to figurative hallucination. We define figurative hallucination as the generation or endorsement of expressions that sound idiomatic and plausible but do not exist as authentic figurative expressions in the target language. We introduce FFEHallu, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating figurative hallucination in LLMs, with a focus on Persian, a linguistically rich yet underrepresented language. FFEHallu consists of 600 carefully curated instances spanning three complementary tasks: (i) FFE generation from meaning, (ii) detection of fabricated FFEs across four controlled construction categories, and (iii) FFE to FFE translation from English to Persian. Evaluating six state of the art multilingual LLMs, we find systematic weaknesses in figurative competence and cultural grounding. While models such as GPT4.1 demonstrate relatively strong performance in rejecting fabricated FFEs and retrieving authentic ones, most models struggle to reliably distinguish real expressions from high quality fabrications and frequently hallucinate during cross lingual translation. These findings reveal substantial gaps in current LLMs handling of figurative language and underscore the need for targeted benchmarks to assess and mitigate figurative hallucination.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faFFEHallu\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u6bd4\u55bb\u8868\u8fbe\uff08\u5982\u4e60\u8bed\u3001\u8c1a\u8bed\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u6bd4\u55bb\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6587\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5f31\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fa\u5b9a\u6bd4\u55bb\u8868\u8fbe\uff08FFEs\uff09\u5982\u4e60\u8bed\u548c\u8c1a\u8bed\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u6210\u6301\u7eed\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u5177\u6709\u6587\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u975e\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u6bd4\u55bb\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u7b49\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFFEHallu\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b600\u4e2a\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a1\uff09\u4ece\u542b\u4e49\u751f\u6210FFE\uff1b2\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u56db\u4e2a\u53d7\u63a7\u6784\u5efa\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f2a\u9020FFE\uff1b3\uff09\u4ece\u82f1\u8bed\u5230\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u7684FFE\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u516d\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aLLMs\u5728\u6bd4\u55bb\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6587\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5f31\u70b9\u3002\u867d\u7136GPT4.1\u5728\u62d2\u7edd\u4f2a\u9020FFE\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u771f\u5b9e\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f2a\u9020\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u7ecf\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6bd4\u55bb\u8bed\u8a00\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u6bd4\u55bb\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6587\u5316\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u3002"}}

This work investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a training paradigm that explicitly rewards abstention (\"I don't know\") alongside correctness to promote intellectual humility. We fine-tune and evaluate Granite-3.3-2B-Instruct and Qwen-3-4B-Instruct on the MedMCQA and Hendrycks Math benchmarks using a ternary reward structure ($-1$, r_abs, 1) under varying abstention reward structures. We further study the effect of combining RLVR with supervised fine-tuning strategies that teach abstention prior to reinforcement learning. Our results show that moderate abstention rewards (r_abs $\\approx -0.25$ to 0.3) consistently reduce incorrect responses without severe accuracy degradation on multiple-choice tasks, with larger models exhibiting greater robustness to abstention incentives. On open-ended question answering, we observe limitations due to insufficient exploration, which can be partially mitigated through supervised abstention training. Overall, these findings demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of verifiable reward design as a practical approach for hallucination mitigation in language models.

However, progress remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale and diverse annotated datasets. Although several Bengali sentiment and hate speech datasets are publicly available, most are limited in size or confined to a single domain, such as social media comments. Consequently, these resources are often insufficient for training modern deep learning based models, which require large volumes of heterogeneous data to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we introduce BengaliSent140, a large-scale Bengali binary sentiment dataset constructed by consolidating seven existing Bengali text datasets into a unified corpus. To ensure consistency across sources, heterogeneous annotation schemes are systematically harmonized into a binary sentiment formulation with two classes: Not Hate (0) and Hate (1). The resulting dataset comprises 139,792 unique text samples, including 68,548 hate and 71,244 not-hate instances, yielding a relatively balanced class distribution. By integrating data from multiple sources and domains, BengaliSent140 offers broader linguistic and contextual coverage than existing Bengali sentiment datasets and provides a strong foundation for training and benchmarking deep learning models. Baseline experimental results are also reported to demonstrate the practical usability of the dataset.

Fine-tuning SSL models on child speech induces shifts in the representation space. We hypothesize that delta SSL embeddings, defined as the differences between embeddings from a finetuned model and those from its pretrained counterpart, encode task-specific information that complements finetuned features from another SSL model. We evaluate multiple fusion strategies on the MyST childrens corpus using different models. Results show that delta embedding fusion with WavLM yields up to a 10 percent relative WER reduction for HuBERT and a 4.4 percent reduction for W2V2, compared to finetuned embedding fusion. Notably, fusing WavLM with delta W2V2 embeddings achieves a WER of 9.64, setting a new state of the art among SSL models on the MyST corpus. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of delta embeddings and highlight feature fusion as a promising direction for advancing child ASR.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528delta SSL\u5d4c\u5165\uff08\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff09\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u513f\u7ae5\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684delta\u5d4c\u5165\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684WER\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u513f\u7ae5\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5fae\u8c03SSL\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5047\u8bbedelta SSL\u5d4c\u5165\uff08\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff09\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8865\u5145\u5176\u4ed6SSL\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528delta SSL\u5d4c\u5165\uff08\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u5176\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5728MyST\u513f\u7ae5\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a1) HuBERT\u7684delta\u5d4c\u5165\u878d\u5408\u4f7fWER\u76f8\u5bf9\u964d\u4f4e10%\uff1b2) W2V2\u7684delta\u5d4c\u5165\u878d\u5408\u4f7fWER\u76f8\u5bf9\u964d\u4f4e4.4%\uff1b3) \u878d\u5408WavLM\u4e0edelta W2V2\u5d4c\u5165\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e869.64%\u7684WER\uff0c\u5728MyST\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u521b\u4e0b\u4e86SSL\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0SOTA\u3002", "conclusion": "delta\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u513f\u7ae5ASR\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u662f\u63a8\u8fdb\u513f\u7ae5\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Yet most studies on tool-calling agents focus on idealized settings with general, fixed, and well-specified tasks. In real-world applications, user requests are often (1) ambiguous, (2) changing over time, or (3) infeasible due to policy constraints, and training and evaluation data that cover these diverse, complex interaction patterns remain under-represented. To bridge the gap, we present Trajectory2Task, a verifiable data generation pipeline for studying tool use at scale under three realistic user scenarios: ambiguous intent, changing intent, and infeasible intents. The pipeline first conducts multi-turn exploration to produce valid tool-call trajectories. It then converts these trajectories into user-facing tasks with controlled intent adaptations. This process yields verifiable task that support closed-loop evaluation and training. We benchmark seven state-of-the-art LLMs on the generated complex user scenario tasks and observe frequent failures. Finally, using successful trajectories obtained from task rollouts, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs and find consistent improvements across all three conditions, along with better generalization to unseen tool-use domains, indicating stronger general tool-calling ability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Trajectory2Task\uff1a\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u610f\u56fe\u3001\u53d8\u5316\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u610f\u56fe\u4e09\u79cd\u73b0\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u8bf7\u6c42\u5f80\u5f80\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3001\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u6216\u7531\u4e8e\u653f\u7b56\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8986\u76d6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTrajectory2Task\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u8f6e\u63a2\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f68\u8ff9\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u652f\u6301\u95ed\u73af\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3", "result": "\u5728\u751f\u6210\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7528\u6237\u573a\u666f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5bf97\u4e2aSOTA LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u9891\u7e41\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u6210\u529f\u8f68\u8ff9\u5fae\u8c03\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LLM\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u90fd\u83b7\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "Trajectory2Task\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7528\u6237\u573a\u666f\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LLM\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u610f\u56fe\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd"}}

While effective, this configuration limits temporal efficiency and audio fidelity. In this work, we explore a simple and effective modification by introducing additional pooling and increasing the decoder hop size. This reduces the latent rate from 50 Hz to 25 Hz and simultaneously raises the output sampling rate from 16 kHz to 24 kHz, improving efficiency and perceptual quality without altering the core architecture. Evaluated on the multilingual Common Voice 17 test set, the proposed configuration achieves a 0.29 MOS improvement over the original X-Codec-2.0 baseline based on UTMOSv2, and attains the best reported performance among all codecs operating at 25 Hz.

This challenge is especially acute in practice-based domains, where knowledge is procedural and grounded in professional judgment, while most existing LLM benchmarks depend on pre-existing human exam datasets that are often unavailable in such settings. We introduce a framework for automated benchmark generation from expert-authored guidelines informed by Bloom's Taxonomy. It converts expert practices into implicit violation-based scenarios and expands them into auto-graded multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and multi-turn dialogues across four cognitive levels, enabling deterministic, reproducible, and scalable evaluation. Applied to three applied domains: teaching, dietetics, and caregiving, we find differences between model and human-like reasoning: LLMs sometimes perform relatively better on higher-order reasoning (Analyze) but fail more frequently on lower-level items (Remember).

We introduce \\textbf{\\textsc{SoftHateBench}}, a generative benchmark that produces soft-hate variants while preserving the underlying hostile standpoint. To generate soft hate, we integrate the \\emph{Argumentum Model of Topics} (AMT) and \\emph{Relevance Theory} (RT) in a unified framework: AMT provides the backbone argument structure for rewriting an explicit hateful standpoint into a seemingly neutral discussion while preserving the stance, and RT guides generation to keep the AMT chain logically coherent. The benchmark spans \\textbf{7} sociocultural domains and \\textbf{28} target groups, comprising \\textbf{4,745} soft-hate instances. Evaluations across encoder-based detectors, general-purpose LLMs, and safety models show a consistent drop from hard to soft tiers: systems that detect explicit hostility often fail when the same stance is conveyed through subtle, reasoning-based language. \\textcolor{red}{\\textbf{Disclaimer.} Contains offensive examples used solely for research.}", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSoftHateBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u8f6f\u6027\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9690\u853d\u4ec7\u6068\u8bc6\u522b\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u8868\u9762\u6bd2\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u8f6f\u6027\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\uff08\u8868\u9762\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u8bba\u8bc1\u5f15\u5bfc\u53d7\u4f17\u6307\u8d23\u6216\u6392\u65a5\u76ee\u6807\u7fa4\u4f53\uff09\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8861\u91cf\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e3b\u9898\u6a21\u578b(AMT)\u548c\u5173\u8054\u7406\u8bba(RT)\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff1aAMT\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cd\u5199\u663e\u6027\u4ec7\u6068\u7acb\u573a\u4e3a\u8868\u9762\u4e2d\u7acb\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u7ed3\u6784\uff0cRT\u6307\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u6301AMT\u94fe\u903b\u8f91\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b7\u4e2a\u793e\u4f1a\u6587\u5316\u9886\u57df\u300128\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u7fa4\u4f53\u30014745\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684SoftHateBench\u57fa\u51c6", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3001\u901a\u7528LLM\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u786c\u6027\u5230\u8f6f\u6027\u4ec7\u6068\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u4e0b\u964d\uff1a\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u663e\u6027\u654c\u610f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7acb\u573a\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u5999\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u65f6\u7ecf\u5e38\u5931\u8d25", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\u63a8\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u654c\u610f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cSoftHateBench\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u8f6f\u6027\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6"}}

However, the popular Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) evaluation mostly measures benign span localization. The needle is near-unique, and the haystack is largely irrelevant. We introduce EverMemBench-S (EMB-S), an adversarial NIAH-style benchmark built on a 326M-token MemoryBank. While the full MemoryBank spans 326M tokens for retrieval-based (RAG) evaluation, we evaluate native long-context models only at scales that fit within each model's context window (up to 1M tokens in this work) to ensure a fair comparison. EMB-S pairs queries with collision-tested near-miss hard negatives and gold evidence sets spanning one or more documents, validated via human screening and LLM verification. We also propose a decoupled diagnostic protocol that reports evidence access (document-ID localization) separately from end-to-end QA quality under full-context prompting. This enables consistent diagnosis for both native long-context prompting and retrieval pipelines. Across a reference-corpus ladder from domain-isolated 64K contexts to a globally shared 326M-token environment, we observe a clear reality gap. Systems that saturate benign NIAH degrade sharply in evidence access under semantic interference.

We argue that current evaluation paradigms suffer from an unanchored defect, leading to two forms of instability: process drift, where unsteered client simulation wanders away from specific counseling goals, and standard drift, where static pointwise scoring lacks the stability for reliable judgment. To address this, we introduce Ps, a unified framework that calibrates the therapeutic competence of LLMs via trajectory-anchored tournaments. We first anchor the interaction trajectory in simulation, where clients precisely control the fluid consultation process to probe multifaceted capabilities. We then anchor the battle trajectory in judgments through an efficient Swiss-system tournament, utilizing dynamic pairwise battles to yield robust Elo ratings. Beyond ranking, we demonstrate that tournament trajectories can be transformed into credible reward signals, enabling on-policy reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' performance.

While new online benchmarks offer more realistic testing than offline ones, they tend to focus on the agents' task instruction-following ability while neglecting their reasoning and exploration ability. Moreover, these benchmarks do not consider the random noise in real-world mobile environments. This leads to a gap between benchmarks and real-world environments. To addressing these limitations, we propose MobileBench-OL, an online benchmark with 1080 tasks from 80 Chinese apps. It measures task execution, complex reasoning, and noise robustness of agents by including 5 subsets, which set multiple evaluation dimensions. We also provide an auto-eval framework with a reset mechanism, enabling stable and repeatable real-world benchmarking. Evaluating 12 leading GUI agents on MobileBench-OL shows significant room for improvement to meet real-world requirements. Human evaluation further confirms that MobileBench-OL can reliably measure the performance of leading GUI agents in real environments.

However, current benchmarks primarily report final accuracy, revealing what models can do but obscuring the cognitive bottlenecks that define their true capability boundaries. To move from simple performance scoring to a diagnostic tool, we introduce a framework grounded in Cognitive Load Theory. Our framework deconstructs task complexity into two quantifiable components: Intrinsic Load, the inherent structural complexity of the solution path, formalized with a novel Tool Interaction Graph; and Extraneous Load, the difficulty arising from ambiguous task presentation. To enable controlled experiments, we construct ToolLoad-Bench, the first benchmark with parametrically adjustable cognitive load. Our evaluation reveals distinct performance cliffs as cognitive load increases, allowing us to precisely map each model's capability boundary.

We present SpeechMapper, a cost-efficient speech-to-LLM-embedding training approach that mitigates overfitting, enabling more robust and generalizable models. Our model is first pretrained without the LLM on inexpensive hardware, and then efficiently attached to the target LLM via a brief 1K-step instruction tuning (IT) stage. Through experiments on speech translation and spoken question answering, we demonstrate the versatility of SpeechMapper's pretrained block, presenting results for both task-agnostic IT, an ASR-based adaptation strategy that does not train in the target task, and task-specific IT. In task-agnostic settings, Speechmapper rivals the best instruction-following speech LLM from IWSLT25, despite never being trained on these tasks, while in task-specific settings, it outperforms this model across many datasets, despite requiring less data and compute.

Parliamentary speeches address a wide range of topics, some of which evoke stronger emotions than others. While everyone has intuitive assumptions about what the most emotive topics in a parliament may be, there has been little research into the emotions typically linked to different topics. This paper strives to fill this gap by examining emotion expression among the topics of parliamentary speeches delivered in Eduskunta, the Finnish Parliament, between 2000 and 2020. An emotion analysis model is used to investigate emotion expression in topics, from both synchronic and diachronic perspectives. The results strengthen evidence of increasing positivity in parliamentary speech and provide further insights into topic-specific emotion expression within parliamentary debate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790\u82ac\u5170\u8bae\u4f1a2000-2020\u5e74\u6f14\u8bb2\u4e2d\u7684\u8bdd\u9898\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u5b58\u5728\u8bdd\u9898\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e14\u6574\u4f53\u5448\u73b0\u79ef\u6781\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5e38\u5c06\u8bae\u4f1a\u8ba8\u8bba\u89c6\u4e3a\u540c\u8d28\u6574\u4f53\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8bdd\u9898\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u8bae\u4f1a\u4e2d\u6700\u5177\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u8bdd\u9898\u6709\u76f4\u89c9\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8bdd\u9898\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u5171\u65f6\u548c\u5386\u65f6\u4e24\u4e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u82ac\u5170\u8bae\u4f1a\uff08Eduskunta\uff092000-2020\u5e74\u95f4\u6f14\u8bb2\u8bdd\u9898\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u5316\u4e86\u8bae\u4f1a\u6f14\u8bb2\u65e5\u76ca\u79ef\u6781\u5316\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8bae\u4f1a\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u8bdd\u9898\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bae\u4f1a\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8bdd\u9898\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u8bdd\u9898\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4e14\u6574\u4f53\u5448\u73b0\u79ef\u6781\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8bae\u4f1a\u653f\u6cbb\u8bdd\u8bed\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

They often exhibit weak planning, tool hallucination, erroneous parameter generation, and struggle with robust interaction. To tackle these issues, we present PEARL, a novel framework to enhance LLM planning and execution for sophisticated tool use. PEARL adopts a two-stage approach: an offline phase where the agent explores tools to learn valid usage patterns and failure conditions, and an online reinforcement learning phase.

Accepted by WWW 2026", "summary": "The prevalence of sarcasm in multimodal dialogues on the social platforms presents a crucial yet challenging task for understanding the true intent behind online content. Comprehensive sarcasm analysis requires two key aspects: Multimodal Sarcasm Detection (MSD) and Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation (MuSE). Intuitively, the act of detection is the result of the reasoning process that explains the sarcasm. Current research predominantly focuses on addressing either MSD or MuSE as a single task. Even though some recent work has attempted to integrate these tasks, their inherent causal dependency is often overlooked. To bridge this gap, we propose MuVaC, a variational causal inference framework that mimics human cognitive mechanisms for understanding sarcasm, enabling robust multimodal feature learning to jointly optimize MSD and MuSE. Specifically, we first model MSD and MuSE from the perspective of structural causal models, establishing variational causal pathways to define the objectives for joint optimization. Next, we design an alignment-then-fusion approach to integrate multimodal features, providing robust fusion representations for sarcasm detection and explanation generation. Finally, we enhance the reasoning trustworthiness by ensuring consistency between detection results and explanations. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MuVaC in public datasets, offering a new perspective for understanding multimodal sarcasm.", "AI": {"tldr": "MuVaC\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d8\u5206\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u6765\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bbd\u523a\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08MSD\uff09\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bbd\u523a\u89e3\u91ca\uff08MuSE\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e2d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bbd\u523a\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u7406\u89e3\u771f\u5b9e\u610f\u56fe\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8981\u4e48\u5355\u72ec\u5904\u7406\u8bbd\u523a\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5355\u72ec\u5904\u7406\u8bbd\u523a\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6709\u5c1d\u8bd5\u6574\u5408\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e5f\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5185\u5728\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u3001\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMuVaC\u53d8\u5206\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4ece\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u89d2\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21MSD\u548cMuSE\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u53d8\u5206\u56e0\u679c\u8def\u5f84\u5b9a\u4e49\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\"\u5bf9\u9f50-\u878d\u5408\"\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u9c81\u68d2\u878d\u5408\u8868\u793a\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u4fdd\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eMuVaC\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bbd\u523a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "MuVaC\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u8bbd\u523a\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bbd\u523a\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Not if a Hallucination Spoils the Bunch", "comment": null, "summary": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has found a widespread use in computing education; at the same time, quality of generated materials raises concerns among educators and students. This study addresses this issue by introducing a novel method for diagram code generation with in-context examples based on the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), which aims to improve diagram generation by aligning models' output with user expectations. Our approach is evaluated by computer science educators, who assessed 150 diagrams generated with large language models (LLMs) for logical organization, connectivity, layout aesthetic, and AI hallucination. The assessment dataset is additionally investigated for its utility in automated diagram evaluation. The preliminary results suggest that our method decreases the rate of factual hallucination and improves diagram faithfulness to provided context; however, due to LLMs' stochasticity, the quality of the generated diagrams varies. Additionally, we present an in-depth analysis and discussion on the connection between AI hallucination and the quality of generated diagrams, which reveals that text contexts of higher complexity lead to higher rates of hallucination and LLMs often fail to detect mistakes in their output.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fee\u8f9e\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u8bba(RST)\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u7528\u6237\u671f\u671b\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11AI\u5e7b\u89c9\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u56fe\u8868\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u6750\u6599\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5f15\u53d1\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u56fe\u8868\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11AI\u5e7b\u89c9", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fee\u8f9e\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u8bba(RST)\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u8868\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u7531\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u8bc4\u4f30150\u4e2a\u56fe\u8868\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3001\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u7f8e\u89c2\u548cAI\u5e7b\u89c9", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u56fe\u8868\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u56e0LLM\u968f\u673a\u6027\u800c\u6ce2\u52a8\uff1b\u590d\u6742\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u9ad8\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\uff0cLLM\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u81ea\u8eab\u9519\u8bef", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eRST\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u56fe\u8868\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46LLM\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u56fe\u8868\u8bc4\u4f30"}}

However, previous assessments of the creative capabilities of LLMs remain weakly grounded in human creativity theory and are thus hard to interpret. The widely used Divergent Association Task (DAT) focuses on novelty, ignoring appropriateness, a core component of creativity. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art LLMs on DAT and show that their scores on the task are lower than those of two baselines that do not possess any creative abilities, undermining its validity for model evaluation. Grounded in human creativity theory, which defines creativity as the combination of novelty and appropriateness, we introduce Conditional Divergent Association Task (CDAT). CDAT evaluates novelty conditional on contextual appropriateness, separating noise from creativity better than DAT, while remaining simple and objective. Under CDAT, smaller model families often show the most creativity, whereas advanced families favor appropriateness at lower novelty. We hypothesize that training and alignment likely shift models along this frontier, making outputs more appropriate but less creative.

Herein, we demonstrate the emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in natural language processing (NLP) models during both pre-training and fine-tuning, even under deterministic dynamics and within a finite training architecture. This phenomenon occurs at the level of individual attention heads and is scaled-down to its small subset of nodes and also valid at a single-nodal level, where nodes acquire the capacity to learn a limited set of tokens after pre-training or labels after fine-tuning for a specific classification task. As the number of nodes increases, a crossover in learning ability occurs, governed by the tradeoff between a decrease following random-guess among increased possible outputs, and enhancement following nodal cooperation, which exceeds the sum of individual nodal capabilities. In contrast to spin-glass systems, where a microscopic state of frozen spins cannot be directly linked to the free-energy minimization goal, each nodal function in this framework contributes explicitly to the global network task and can be upper-bounded using convex hull analysis.

The results show that universal syntactic information is largely insensitive to historical contact, whereas morphological features such as Case and Gender are strongly shaped by language-specific structure, suggesting that contact effects in monolingual language models are selective and structurally constrained.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u5355\u8bed\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u89e6\u7ed3\u6784\u75d5\u8ff9\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53e5\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u5386\u53f2\u63a5\u89e6\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u800c\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u683c\u548c\u6027\uff09\u53d7\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u5f3a\u70c8\u5f71\u54cd", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u89e6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u75d5\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\uff08\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u4e0e\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u63a5\u89e6\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u53d8\u5316", "method": "\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u6001\u53e5\u6cd5\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u63a5\u89e6\u4e0e\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u63a5\u89e6\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8bed\u8a00", "result": "\u901a\u7528\u53e5\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u5386\u53f2\u63a5\u89e6\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u800c\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u683c\u548c\u6027\uff09\u53d7\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u5f3a\u70c8\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5355\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u6548\u5e94\u662f\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u7684", "conclusion": "\u5355\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u89e6\u6548\u5e94\u5177\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u6027\uff0c\u53e5\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u76f8\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u66f4\u6613\u53d7\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u89e6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2"}}

However, in daily scenarios, the perception of these advanced AI capabilities among general users remains limited. We argue that current evaluations prioritize increasing task difficulty without sufficiently addressing the diversity of agentic tasks necessary to cover the daily work, life, and learning activities of a broad demographic. To address this, we propose AgentIF-OneDay, aimed at determining whether general users can utilize natural language instructions and AI agents to complete a diverse array of daily tasks. These tasks require not only solving problems through dialogue but also understanding various attachment types and delivering tangible file-based results. The benchmark is structured around three user-centric categories: Open Workflow Execution, which assesses adherence to explicit and complex workflows; Latent Instruction, which requires agents to infer implicit instructions from attachments; and Iterative Refinement, which involves modifying or expanding upon ongoing work. We employ instance-level rubrics and a refined evaluation pipeline that aligns LLM-based verification with human judgment, achieving an 80.1% agreement rate using Gemini-3-Pro. AgentIF-OneDay comprises 104 tasks covering 767 scoring points. We benchmarked four leading general AI agents and found that agent products built based on APIs and ChatGPT agents based on agent RL remain in the first tier simultaneously.

To this end, methods like Reinforcement Learning with Reference Probability Reward (RLPR) have emerged, leveraging the probability of generating the final answer as a reward signal. However, these outcome-focused approaches neglect crucial step-by-step supervision of the reasoning process itself. To address this gap, we introduce Probabilistic Process Supervision (P2S), a novel self-supervision framework that provides fine-grained process rewards without requiring a separate reward model or human-annotated reasoning steps. During reinforcement learning, P2S synthesizes and filters a high-quality reference reasoning chain (gold-CoT). The core of our method is to calculate a Path Faithfulness Reward (PFR) for each reasoning step, which is derived from the conditional probability of generating the gold-CoT's suffix, given the model's current reasoning prefix. Crucially, this PFR can be flexibly integrated with any outcome-based reward, directly tackling the reward sparsity problem by providing dense guidance.

While multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has shown promise in enhancing VQA systems by providing more evidence on both image and text sides, the default procedure that addresses VQA queries, especially the knowledge-intensive ones, often relies on multi-stage pipelines of mRAG with inherent dependencies. To mitigate the inefficiency limitations while maintaining VQA task performance, this paper proposes a method that trains a multimodal planning agent, dynamically decomposing the mRAG pipeline to solve the VQA task. Our method optimizes the trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness by training the agent to intelligently determine the necessity of each mRAG step. In our experiments, the agent can help reduce redundant computations, cutting search time by over 60\\% compared to existing methods and decreasing costly tool calls.

Reverse engineering continues to threaten software security, while traditional virtual machine protection (VMP) relies on rigid, rule-based transformations that are costly to design and vulnerable to automated analysis. In this work, we present the first protection-aware framework that learns robust representations of VMP-protected code. Our approach builds large-scale paired datasets of source code and normalized VM implementations, and introduces hierarchical dependency modeling at intra-, preceding-, and inter-instruction levels. We jointly optimize language modeling with functionality-aware and protection-aware contrastive objectives to capture both semantic equivalence and protection strength. To further assess resilience, we propose a protection effectiveness optimization task that quantifies and ranks different VM variants derived from the same source. Coupled with a two-stage continual pre-training and fine-tuning pipeline, our method enables models to generate, compare, and reason over protected code. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly improves robustness across diverse protection levels, opening a new research direction for learning-based software defense. In this work, we present ShieldedCode, the first protection-aware framework that learns robust representations of VMP-protected code.

We investigate the replacement of HDBSCAN (offline clustering) with online (streaming/incremental) clustering methods in a production narrative report generation pipeline. The proposed system employs a three-stage architecture (data collection, modeling, dashboard generation) that processes thousands of multilingual social media documents daily. While HDBSCAN excels at discovering hierarchical density-based clusters and handling noise, its batch-only nature necessitates complete retraining for each time window, resulting in memory constraints, computational inefficiency, and inability to adapt to evolving narratives in real-time. This work evaluates a bunch of online clustering algorithms across dimensions of cluster quality preservation, computational efficiency, memory footprint, and integration compatibility with existing workflows. We propose evaluation criteria that balance traditional clustering metrics (Silhouette Coefficient, Davies-Bouldin Index) with narrative metrics (narrative distinctness, contingency and variance). Our methodology includes sliding-window simulations on historical datasets from Ukraine information space, enabling comparative analysis of algorithmic trade-offs in realistic operational contexts.

This framework generates rigorous interaction trajectories across knowledge-intensive and knowledge-free scenarios. Experiments with state-of-the-art models and memory systems (32K to 4M tokens) expose a critical weakness: while adept at static retrieval, agents struggle with the dynamic information synthesis essential for workflows.

We investigate whether explicit information about a subject's gender or sexuality influences LLM responses across three subject categories: queer-marked, non-queer-marked, and the normalized \"unmarked\" category. Representational imbalances are operationalized as measurable differences in English sentence completions across four dimensions: sentiment, regard, toxicity, and prediction diversity. Our findings show that Masked Language Models (MLMs) produce the least favorable sentiment, higher toxicity, and more negative regard for queer-marked subjects. Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs) partially mitigate these patterns, while closed-access ARLMs tend to produce more harmful outputs for unmarked subjects. Results suggest that LLMs reproduce normative social assumptions, though the form and degree of bias depend strongly on specific model characteristics, which may redistribute, but not eliminate, representational harms.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u518d\u73b0\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f02\u6027\u604b\u89c4\u8303\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5bf9\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a\u9177\u513f\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u4e0d\u5229\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u6bd2\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u8d1f\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u518d\u73b0\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f02\u6027\u604b\u89c4\u8303\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c4\u8303\u5982\u4f55\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6027\u522b\u548c\u6027\u53d6\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u5904\u7406\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5bf9\u8c61\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u9177\u513f\u6807\u8bb0\u3001\u975e\u9177\u513f\u6807\u8bb0\u3001\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\"\u6b63\u5e38\u5316\"\u7c7b\u522b\uff09\u7814\u7a76LLM\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u8bc4\u4ef7\u3001\u6bd2\u6027\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u8868\u5f81\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u63a9\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u63a9\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9177\u513f\u6807\u8bb0\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u4e0d\u5229\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u6bd2\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u8d1f\u9762\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff1b\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u5206\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u95ed\u6e90\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u6709\u5bb3\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u518d\u73b0\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u793e\u4f1a\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4f46\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u4f46\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6d88\u9664\u8868\u5f81\u4f24\u5bb3\u3002"}}

We analyze 5,126 Reddit posts from 47 mental health communities describing experiential or exploratory use of AI for emotional support or therapy. Grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model and therapeutic alliance theory, we develop a theory-informed annotation framework and apply a hybrid LLM-human pipeline to analyze evaluative language, adoption-related attitudes, and relational alignment at scale. Our results show that engagement is shaped primarily by narrated outcomes, trust, and response quality, rather than emotional bond alone. Positive sentiment is most strongly associated with task and goal alignment, while companionship-oriented use more often involves misaligned alliances and reported risks such as dependence and symptom escalation.

While Persona prompting (PP) is increasingly used as a way to steer model towards user-specific generation, its effect on model rationales remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-generated rationales vary when conditioned on different simulated demographic personas. Using datasets annotated with word-level rationales, we measure agreement with human annotations from different demographic groups, and assess the impact of PP on model bias and human alignment. Our evaluation across three LLMs results reveals three key findings: (1) PP improving classification on the most subjective task (hate speech) but degrading rationale quality. (2) Simulated personas fail to align with their real-world demographic counterparts, and high inter-persona agreement shows models are resistant to significant steering. (3) Models exhibit consistent demographic biases and a strong tendency to over-flag content as harmful, regardless of PP.

Yet the cost and complexity of training has kept this advantage theoretical. We show it is now practical. We present Soft-Verified Efficient Repository Agents (SERA), an efficient method for training coding agents that enables the rapid and cheap creation of agents specialized to private codebases. Using only supervised finetuning (SFT), SERA achieves state-of-the-art results among fully open-source (open data, method, code) models while matching the performance of frontier open-weight models like Devstral-Small-2. Creating SERA models is 26x cheaper than reinforcement learning and 57x cheaper than previous synthetic data methods to reach equivalent performance. Our method, Soft Verified Generation (SVG), generates thousands of trajectories from a single code repository. Combined with cost-efficiency, this enables specialization to private codebases. Beyond repository specialization, we apply SVG to a larger corpus of codebases, generating over 200,000 synthetic trajectories. We use this dataset to provide detailed analysis of scaling laws, ablations, and confounding factors for training coding agents.

Motivated by this phenomenon, we ask: how do transformers learn to associate information across modalities from in-context examples? We investigate this question through controlled experiments on small transformers trained on synthetic classification tasks, enabling precise manipulation of data statistics and model architecture. We begin by revisiting core principles of unimodal ICL in modern transformers. While several prior findings replicate, we find that Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) increases the data complexity threshold for ICL. Extending to the multimodal setting reveals a fundamental learning asymmetry: when pretrained on high-diversity data from a primary modality, surprisingly low data complexity in the secondary modality suffices for multimodal ICL to emerge. Mechanistic analysis shows that both settings rely on an induction-style mechanism that copies labels from matching in-context exemplars; multimodal training refines and extends these circuits across modalities. Our findings provide a mechanistic foundation for understanding multimodal ICL in modern transformers and introduce a controlled testbed for future investigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Transformer\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5f53\u5728\u4e3b\u8981\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\uff0c\u6b21\u8981\u6a21\u6001\u53ea\u9700\u6781\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u578bTransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u6570\u636e\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u9996\u5148\u56de\u987e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u63a2\u7a76\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0RoPE\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\uff1b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\uff1a\u4e3b\u8981\u6a21\u6001\u9ad8\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\uff0c\u6b21\u8981\u6a21\u6001\u53ea\u9700\u6781\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u4e24\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u90fd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4ece\u5339\u914d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\u590d\u5236\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u5f0f\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u73b0\u4ee3Transformer\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u5236\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53d7\u63a7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u4f9b\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

Here, we study the dynamics of these representations: how representations evolve along these dimensions within the context of (simulated) conversations. We find that linear representations can change dramatically over a conversation; for example, information that is represented as factual at the beginning of a conversation can be represented as non-factual at the end and vice versa. These changes are content-dependent; while representations of conversation-relevant information may change, generic information is generally preserved. These changes are robust even for dimensions that disentangle factuality from more superficial response patterns, and occur across different model families and layers of the model. These representation changes do not require on-policy conversations; even replaying a conversation script written by an entirely different model can produce similar changes. However, adaptation is much weaker from simply having a sci-fi story in context that is framed more explicitly as such. We also show that steering along a representational direction can have dramatically different effects at different points in a conversation. These results are consistent with the idea that representations may evolve in response to the model playing a particular role that is cued by a conversation. Our findings may pose challenges for interpretability and steering -- in particular, they imply that it may be misleading to use static interpretations of features or directions, or probes that assume a particular range of features consistently corresponds to a particular ground-truth value.

Accepted to EACL 2026 main conference. Code can be found here: github.com/Mr-Ao-25/cross-ling-contamination", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can be benchmark-contaminated, resulting in inflated scores that mask memorization as generalization, and in multilingual settings, this memorization can even transfer to \"uncontaminated\" languages. Using the FLORES-200 translation benchmark as a diagnostic, we study two 7-8B instruction-tuned multilingual LLMs: Bloomz, which was trained on FLORES, and Llama as an uncontaminated control. We confirm Bloomz's FLORES contamination and demonstrate that machine translation contamination can be cross-directional, artificially boosting performance in unseen translation directions due to target-side memorization. Further analysis shows that recall of memorized references often persists despite various source-side perturbation efforts like paraphrasing and named entity replacement. However, replacing named entities leads to a consistent decrease in BLEU, suggesting an effective probing method for memorization in contaminated models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6c61\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f1a\u8de8\u65b9\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u865a\u9ad8\uff0c\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u8bb0\u5fc6\u800c\u975e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6c61\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u6570\u865a\u9ad8\uff0c\u5c06\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f2a\u88c5\u6210\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u80fd\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\"\u672a\u53d7\u6c61\u67d3\"\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528FLORES-200\u7ffb\u8bd1\u57fa\u51c6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u4e2a7-8B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18LLM\uff1a\u5728FLORES\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Bloomz\u548c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672a\u53d7\u6c61\u67d3\u5bf9\u7167\u7684Llama\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6e90\u7aef\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u6539\u5199\u548c\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u66ff\u6362\uff09\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790BLEU\u5206\u6570\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86Bloomz\u5b58\u5728FLORES\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6c61\u67d3\u53ef\u4ee5\u662f\u8de8\u65b9\u5411\u7684\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u7aef\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bfc\u81f4\u672a\u89c1\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u88ab\u865a\u5047\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5404\u79cd\u6e90\u7aef\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u56de\u5fc6\u901a\u5e38\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u66ff\u6362\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4BLEU\u5206\u6570\u4e00\u81f4\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8fd9\u6210\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6c61\u67d3\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u51c6\u6c61\u67d3\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u4e2d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e25\u91cd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5931\u771f\u3002\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u66ff\u6362\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u533a\u5206\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\u3002"}}
