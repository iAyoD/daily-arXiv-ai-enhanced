### [1] [Democratizing LLM Efficiency: From Hyperscale Optimizations to Universal Deployability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20662)
*Hen-Hsen Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文主张LLM效率研究应从追求大规模复杂技术转向注重资源受限环境下的稳健简单性，提出新的研究方向以降低部署成本、促进公平和可持续发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流效率方法（MoE、推测解码、复杂RAG）仅适用于拥有庞大基础设施的科技巨头，对普通机构来说反而带来额外开销和复杂性，加剧了技术不平等和碳浪费问题。

Method: 提出新的研究议程：无需重新训练的预训练模型架构改造、轻量级微调保持对齐、长思维链的经济推理、无需重型RAG管道的动态知识管理，以及采用开销感知效率作为标准基准。

Result: 通过重新定义效率概念，将采用成本、可持续性和公平性纳入考量，能够实现LLM部署的民主化。

Conclusion: 优化应减少不平等和碳浪费而非加剧它们，下一前沿是资源有限环境下的稳健简单性而非大规模复杂化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable, but the most celebrated efficiency methods -- mixture-of-experts (MoE), speculative decoding, and complex retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- were built for hyperscale providers with vast infrastructure and elite teams. Outside that context, their benefits collapse into overhead, fragility, and wasted carbon. The result is that a handful of Big Tech companies benefit, while thousands of hospitals, schools, governments, and enterprises are left without viable options. We argue that the next frontier is not greater sophistication at scale, but robust simplicity: efficiency that thrives under modest resources and minimal expertise. We propose a new research agenda: retrofitting pretrained models with more efficient architectures without retraining, inventing lightweight fine-tuning that preserves alignment, making reasoning economical despite long chains of thought, enabling dynamic knowledge management without heavy RAG pipelines, and adopting Overhead-Aware Efficiency (OAE) as a standard benchmark. By redefining efficiency to include adoption cost, sustainability, and fairness, we can democratize LLM deployment -- ensuring that optimization reduces inequality and carbon waste rather than amplifying them.

### [2] [Harmonic Token Projection (HTP): A Vocabulary-Free, Training-Free, Deterministic, and Reversible Embedding Methodology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20665)
*Tcharlies Schmitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HTP是一种无需训练、词汇表或随机参数的可逆确定性文本嵌入框架，通过将Unicode编码转换为谐波轨迹来生成嵌入向量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在提供一种透明、高效且可解释的替代方案，避免神经网络嵌入对统计共现或优化的依赖

Method: 将每个token的Unicode整数编码解析为谐波轨迹，建立离散符号与连续向量空间的双射可逆映射

Result: 在STS-B基准测试中达到Spearman相关性0.68，在10种语言中保持稳定性能，计算成本极低且延迟小于毫秒

Conclusion: 证明有意义的语义关系可以从确定性几何中产生，为数据驱动嵌入提供了透明高效的替代方案

Abstract: This paper introduces the Harmonic Token Projection (HTP), a reversible and deterministic framework for generating text embeddings without training, vocabularies, or stochastic parameters. Unlike neural embeddings that rely on statistical co-occurrence or optimization, HTP encodes each token analytically as a harmonic trajectory derived from its Unicode integer representation, establishing a bijective and interpretable mapping between discrete symbols and continuous vector space. The harmonic formulation provides phase-coherent projections that preserve both structure and reversibility, enabling semantic similarity estimation from purely geometric alignment. Experimental evaluation on the Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B) and its multilingual extension shows that HTP achieves a Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.68 in English, maintaining stable performance across ten languages with negligible computational cost and sub-millisecond latency per sentence pair. This demonstrates that meaningful semantic relations can emerge from deterministic geometry, offering a transparent and efficient alternative to data-driven embeddings. Keywords: Harmonic Token Projection, reversible embedding, deterministic encoding, semantic similarity, multilingual representation.

### [3] [A centroid based framework for text classification in itsm environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20667)
*Hossein Mohanna,Ali Ait-Bachir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于双嵌入质心的分类框架，用于IT服务管理中的分层分类，在保持竞争力的同时显著提升训练和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IT服务管理系统需要将工单分类到树状分层结构中，现有方法在可解释性和操作效率方面存在不足。

Method: 使用双嵌入质心表示方法，分别为每个类别维护语义和词汇质心表示，在推理时通过互逆排名融合进行组合。

Result: 在8,968个ITSM工单的123个类别上，性能与支持向量机相当（分层F1：0.731 vs 0.727），训练速度快5.9倍，增量更新快152倍，推理速度快8.6-8.8倍。

Conclusion: 该方法适合生产环境中的ITSM系统，在保持可解释性的同时显著提升了操作效率。

Abstract: Text classification with hierarchical taxonomies is a fundamental requirement in IT Service Management (ITSM) systems, where support tickets must be categorized into tree-structured taxonomies. We present a dual-embedding centroid-based classification framework that maintains separate semantic and lexical centroid representations per category, combining them through reciprocal rank fusion at inference time. The framework achieves performance competitive with Support Vector Machines (hierarchical F1: 0.731 vs 0.727) while providing interpretability through centroid representations. Evaluated on 8,968 ITSM tickets across 123 categories, this method achieves 5.9 times faster training and up to 152 times faster incremental updates. With 8.6-8.8 times speedup across batch sizes (100-1000 samples) when excluding embedding computation. These results make the method suitable for production ITSM environments prioritizing interpretability and operational efficiency.

### [4] [PIRA: Preference-Oriented Instruction-Tuned Reward Models with Dual Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20668)
*Yongfu Xue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PIRA是一个解决奖励模型数据效率低和奖励过度优化问题的训练范式，通过重构问答对、聚合多样化偏好任务和平均不同dropout率下的输出来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统判别式奖励模型存在数据效率低和容易奖励过度优化的问题，需要更有效的训练方法。

Method: PIRA采用三种策略：将问答对重构为基于偏好的指令、聚合多样化偏好任务的奖励、平均不同dropout率下的价值头输出。

Result: 大量实验证明了PIRA的有效性。

Conclusion: PIRA训练范式成功解决了奖励模型面临的关键挑战，提升了数据效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reward models are crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences but face two representative challenges. First, traditional discriminative reward models usually concatenate questions and responses directly as input, resulting in low data efficiency. Second, reward models are vulnerable to reward overoptimization. We propose PIRA, a training paradigm addressing these issues through three strategies: (1) Reformulating question-answer pairs into preference-based instructions for clearer and more explicit task specification, (2) aggregating rewards from diverse preference tasks to reduce bias and improve robustness, and (3) averaging value-head outputs under varying dropout rates to stabilize rewards. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of PIRA.

### [5] [Structured Definitions and Segmentations for Legal Reasoning in LLMs: A Study on Indian Legal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20669)
*Mann Khatri,Mirza Yusuf,Rajiv Ratn Shah,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了如何通过重组法律文档结构、定义修辞角色和模拟法庭推理来提升大语言模型在法律任务中的表现，在印度法律判决预测数据集上实现了1.5%-4.36%的F1分数提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在通用领域表现出色，但在法律等专业领域表现不佳，主要因为缺乏领域特定的预训练，且法律文档通常冗长复杂，难以有效处理。

Method: 通过三个实验：(1)基于修辞角色重组文档结构，(2)定义修辞角色使模型熟悉法律术语，(3)模拟法庭对修辞角色的逐步推理过程，在零样本设置下测试三个印度法律判决预测数据集。

Result: 数据重组或解释关键法律术语显著提升了模型性能，相比基线F1分数最低提升约1.5%，最高提升4.36%。

Conclusion: 通过结构化信息处理和引入领域特定知识，可以有效提升大语言模型在法律任务中的表现，特别是在处理长文本和复杂推理方面。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets from the web, exhibit remarkable general reasoning skills. Despite this, they often struggle in specialized areas like law, mainly because they lack domain-specific pretraining. The legal field presents unique challenges, as legal documents are generally long and intricate, making it hard for models to process the full text efficiently. Previous studies have examined in-context approaches to address the knowledge gap, boosting model performance in new domains without full domain alignment. In our paper, we analyze model behavior on legal tasks by conducting experiments in three areas: (i) reorganizing documents based on rhetorical roles to assess how structured information affects long context processing and model decisions, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize the model with legal terminology, and (iii) emulating the step-by-step reasoning of courts regarding rhetorical roles to enhance model reasoning. These experiments are conducted in a zero-shot setting across three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets. Our results reveal that organizing data or explaining key legal terms significantly boosts model performance, with a minimum increase of ~1.5% and a maximum improvement of 4.36% in F1 score compared to the baseline.

### [6] [MindSET: Advancing Mental Health Benchmarking through Large-Scale Social Media Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20672)
*Saad Mankarious,Ayah Zirikly,Daniel Wiechmann,Elma Kerz,Edward Kempa,Yu Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MindSET数据集，这是一个从Reddit收集的包含13M标注帖子的心理健康分析基准数据集，覆盖7种心理健康状况，规模是之前基准的两倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理健康分析基准数据集已过时，存在数据有限、清洗不足、内容多样性（多语言和有害内容）等问题，需要新的高质量数据集来支持心理健康研究。

Method: 从Reddit收集自报告诊断数据，应用严格预处理步骤（语言过滤、NSFW内容移除、重复内容删除），使用LIWC进行语言分析，并通过微调语言模型和词袋特征进行二元分类实验。

Result: 在MindSET上训练的模型在诊断检测任务中始终优于之前基准训练的模型，自闭症检测的F1分数提高了18个百分点。

Conclusion: MindSET为研究社交媒体与心理健康交叉领域提供了坚实基础，支持早期风险检测和新兴心理趋势的深入分析。

Abstract: Social media data has become a vital resource for studying mental health, offering real-time insights into thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that traditional methods often miss. Progress in this area has been facilitated by benchmark datasets for mental health analysis; however, most existing benchmarks have become outdated due to limited data availability, inadequate cleaning, and the inherently diverse nature of social media content (e.g., multilingual and harmful material). We present a new benchmark dataset, \textbf{MindSET}, curated from Reddit using self-reported diagnoses to address these limitations. The annotated dataset contains over \textbf{13M} annotated posts across seven mental health conditions, more than twice the size of previous benchmarks. To ensure data quality, we applied rigorous preprocessing steps, including language filtering, and removal of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) and duplicate content. We further performed a linguistic analysis using LIWC to examine psychological term frequencies across the eight groups represented in the dataset. To demonstrate the dataset utility, we conducted binary classification experiments for diagnosis detection using both fine-tuned language models and Bag-of-Words (BoW) features. Models trained on MindSET consistently outperformed those trained on previous benchmarks, achieving up to an \textbf{18-point} improvement in F1 for Autism detection. Overall, MindSET provides a robust foundation for researchers exploring the intersection of social media and mental health, supporting both early risk detection and deeper analysis of emerging psychological trends.

### [7] [Semantics Meet Signals: Dual Codebook Representationl Learning for Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20673)
*Zheng Hui,Xiaokai Wei,Reza Shirkavand,Chen Wang,Weizhi Zhang,Alejandro Peláez,Michelle Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FlexCode是一个流行度感知的生成推荐框架，通过动态分配协作过滤和语义代码本的token预算，解决了传统方法对热门和长尾项目统一编码的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成推荐方法使用单一代码本编码所有项目，忽视了热门项目（富含协作信号）和长尾项目（依赖语义理解）之间的不平衡，这种统一处理限制了表示效率和泛化能力。

Method: 引入FlexCode框架，自适应地在协作过滤代码本和语义代码本之间分配固定token预算，使用轻量级MoE动态平衡CF精度和语义泛化，并通过对齐和平滑目标保持流行度谱系的一致性。

Result: 在公共和工业规模数据集上的实验表明，FlexCode持续优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: FlexCode为生成推荐器中的token表示提供了新机制，实现了更强的准确性和尾部鲁棒性，为基于token的推荐模型中平衡记忆和泛化提供了新视角。

Abstract: Generative recommendation has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm that unifies retrieval and generation, representing items as discrete semantic tokens and enabling flexible sequence modeling with autoregressive models. Despite its success, existing approaches rely on a single, uniform codebook to encode all items, overlooking the inherent imbalance between popular items rich in collaborative signals and long-tail items that depend on semantic understanding. We argue that this uniform treatment limits representational efficiency and hinders generalization. To address this, we introduce FlexCode, a popularity-aware framework that adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering (CF) codebook and a semantic codebook. A lightweight MoE dynamically balances CF-specific precision and semantic generalization, while an alignment and smoothness objective maintains coherence across the popularity spectrum. We perform experiments on both public and industrial-scale datasets, showing that FlexCode consistently outperform strong baselines. FlexCode provides a new mechanism for token representation in generative recommenders, achieving stronger accuracy and tail robustness, and offering a new perspective on balancing memorization and generalization in token-based recommendation models.

### [8] [Prompt Engineering Techniques for Context-dependent Text-to-SQL in Arabic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20677)
*Saleh Almohaimeed,May Alsofyani,Saad Almohaimeed,Mansour Al Ghanim,Liqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Ar-SParC，首个阿拉伯语跨领域上下文相关文本到SQL数据集，包含3,450个相关问题和10,225个问题-SQL对。使用GPT模型进行了40个实验，并开发了GAT校正器方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大多数文本到SQL研究集中在英语和中文，阿拉伯语领域尚无相关工作。为填补这一空白，需要创建阿拉伯语跨领域上下文相关文本到SQL数据集。

Method: 构建Ar-SParC数据集，使用GPT-3.5-turbo和GPT-4.5-turbo进行40个实验，应用10种提示工程技术，并开发了GAT校正器方法。

Result: GAT校正器在所有40个实验中均提升了性能，在零样本设置下平均提升1.9%执行准确率和1.9%交互准确率，在上下文学习设置下平均提升1.72%执行准确率和0.92%交互准确率。

Conclusion: 成功创建了首个阿拉伯语跨领域上下文相关文本到SQL数据集，并证明了GAT校正器方法的有效性，特别是在阿拉伯语言处理中优于之前的GAT验证器技术。

Abstract: In recent years, the task of cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL has received significant attention. Enables users with no prior knowledge of SQL to have a conversation with databases using natural language. However, most of the available datasets and research have been conducted in English, along with some work in Chinese. To this date, no effort has been made to address this task in the Arabic language. In this paper, we introduce Ar-SParC, the first Arabic cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL dataset. The dataset consists of 3,450 sequences of interrelated questions, each sequence containing an average of approximately three questions, which results in a total of 10225 questions along with their corresponding SQL queries. We conducted 40 experiments on the Ar-SParC dataset using two large language models, GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo, applying 10 different prompt engineering techniques, including four question representation methods and six in-context learning techniques. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach named GAT corrector, which enhanced the performance across all 40 experiments, yielding an average improvement of 1.9% in execution accuracy (EX) and 1.9% in interaction accuracy (IX) under zero-shot settings, and an average increase of 1.72% EX and 0.92% IX under in-context learning settings. Finally, we conducted an ablation study with two more experiments to explain why the GAT corrector outperformed the previous GAT verifier technique, particularly for the Arabic language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在肿瘤学决策支持中可能通过错误推理得出正确结论，这种安全风险未被基于准确性的评估捕获。开发了推理错误分类法，发现23%的解释存在推理错误，且与临床指南不一致的潜在有害建议相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在临床基准测试中表现良好，但它们可能通过错误推理得出正确结论，这种失败模式在肿瘤学决策支持中具有安全影响，但基于准确性的评估无法捕捉到这一点。

Method: 开发了三级推理错误分类法，从GPT-4对真实肿瘤学笔记的思维链响应中定义推理错误。在CORAL数据集的乳腺癌和胰腺癌笔记中标注了600个推理轨迹，并在822个前列腺癌咨询笔记响应中验证了该分类法。

Result: 23%的解释存在推理错误，确认偏误和锚定偏误最常见。推理失败与指南不一致和潜在有害建议相关，特别是在晚期疾病管理中。自动化评估器能检测错误存在但无法可靠分类子类型。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在推理存在缺陷时可能提供流畅但临床不安全的建议。该分类法为临床部署前评估和改进推理保真度提供了可推广的框架。

Abstract: Despite high performance on clinical benchmarks, large language models may reach correct conclusions through faulty reasoning, a failure mode with safety implications for oncology decision support that is not captured by accuracy-based evaluation. In this two-cohort retrospective study, we developed a hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors from GPT-4 chain-of-thought responses to real oncology notes and tested its clinical relevance. Using breast and pancreatic cancer notes from the CORAL dataset, we annotated 600 reasoning traces to define a three-tier taxonomy mapping computational failures to cognitive bias frameworks. We validated the taxonomy on 822 responses from prostate cancer consult notes spanning localized through metastatic disease, simulating extraction, analysis, and clinical recommendation tasks. Reasoning errors occurred in 23 percent of interpretations and dominated overall errors, with confirmation bias and anchoring bias most common. Reasoning failures were associated with guideline-discordant and potentially harmful recommendations, particularly in advanced disease management. Automated evaluators using state-of-the-art language models detected error presence but could not reliably classify subtypes. These findings show that large language models may provide fluent but clinically unsafe recommendations when reasoning is flawed. The taxonomy provides a generalizable framework for evaluating and improving reasoning fidelity before clinical deployment.

### [10] [Dynamic Template Selection for Output Token Generation Optimization: MLP-Based and Transformer Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20683)
*Bharadwaj Yadavalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了动态模板选择（DTS）方法，根据查询复杂度自适应选择响应模板，在保持响应质量的同时显著降低token成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型部署采用统一的提示策略，对复杂分析任务和简单事实问题都使用冗长的响应模式，导致token效率低下，而输出token成本比输入token高4-8倍。

Method: 比较了两种路由方法：使用预计算嵌入的简单MLP和微调的RoBERTa transformer。通过MLP路由器和RoBERTa路由器的对比实验。

Result: MLP路由器在测试数据上达到90.5%的路由准确率，略高于RoBERTa的89.5%，但参数少1.25亿。在三个主要LLM提供商上验证，路由准确率保持90.5%，token减少32.6%-33.9%。

Conclusion: DTS方法能有效降低token成本，MLP路由器在准确率和效率上表现优异，路由决策在不同LLM提供商间具有通用性。

Abstract: Contemporary large language model deployments typically employ uniform prompting strategies across diverse query types, applying verbose response patterns to both complex analytical tasks and straightforward factual questions. This one-size-fits-all methodology leads to substantial token inefficiency, a concern amplified by the significant cost differential between input and output tokens--the latter commanding 4-8x higher prices across major providers. We present Dynamic Template Selection (DTS), which adaptively matches response templates to query complexity, achieving significant cost reductions without compromising response quality.
  We compared two routing approaches: a simple MLP that uses pre-computed embeddings and a more complex fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer. Through comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 MMLU questions, we find that the MLP router achieves 90.5% routing accuracy on held-out test data, marginally exceeding RoBERTa's performance (89.5%) despite utilizing 125M fewer parameters. Notably, our empirical analysis reveals provider-agnostic behavior in template selection--routing decisions generalize effectively across 3 major LLM providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude), as validated through 9,000 production API calls. While routing accuracy remains consistent at 90.5% across providers, observed token reductions vary from 32.6% to 33.9%, reflecting provider-specific generation characteristics.
  This work contributes several key elements: formal problem formulation with theoretical grounding in machine learning, four algorithms with corresponding complexity analyses, and extensive empirical validation across production systems.

### [12] [Memories Retrieved from Many Paths: A Multi-Prefix Framework for Robust Detection of Training Data Leakage in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20799)
*Trung Cuong Dang,David Mohaisen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出多前缀记忆框架，通过评估序列能被不同前缀检索的多样性来定义记忆化，比单路径提取更全面衡量LLM的数据泄露风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆化定义在全面捕捉对齐模型中的记忆现象方面存在不足，需要更可靠的框架来评估LLM的隐私和版权风险。

Method: 引入多前缀记忆框架，核心观点是记忆序列深度编码，可通过大量不同前缀检索；定义序列被记忆的条件是外部对抗搜索能找到足够数量的不同前缀来引出该序列。

Result: 在开源和对齐聊天模型上的实验表明，多前缀定义能可靠区分记忆化和非记忆化数据，为审计LLM数据泄露提供了稳健实用的工具。

Conclusion: 多前缀记忆框架通过量化记忆的稳健性（检索路径多样性），为评估LLM数据泄露风险提供了更全面可靠的方法。

Abstract: Large language models, trained on massive corpora, are prone to verbatim memorization of training data, creating significant privacy and copyright risks. While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework: multi-prefix memorization. Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths. Through experiments on open-source and aligned chat models, we demonstrate that our multi-prefix definition reliably distinguishes memorized from non-memorized data, providing a robust and practical tool for auditing data leakage in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAGE是一个基于智能体的框架，将稀疏自编码器特征解释从被动单次生成任务转变为主动、解释驱动的过程，通过系统制定多个解释、设计针对性实验和基于激活反馈迭代优化，显著提高了特征解释的生成和预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的内部机制仍然不透明，这对其安全可靠部署构成挑战。稀疏自编码器是分解LLM表示的有前途工具，但解释SAE捕获的特征仍然是一个困难任务。

Method: 提出SAGE框架，将特征解释重新定义为主动、解释驱动的过程。系统地为每个特征制定多个解释，设计针对性实验进行测试，并基于经验激活反馈迭代优化解释。

Result: 在多种语言模型的SAE特征上进行实验，证明SAGE产生的解释在生成和预测准确性方面显著优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: SAGE通过主动、迭代的解释过程，有效提高了稀疏自编码器特征的可解释性，为大语言模型的透明化提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque, posing a significant challenge to their safe and reliable deployment. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for decomposing LLM representations into more interpretable features, but explaining the features captured by SAEs remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose SAGE (SAE AGentic Explainer), an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanation-driven process. SAGE implements a rigorous methodology by systematically formulating multiple explanations for each feature, designing targeted experiments to test them, and iteratively refining explanations based on empirical activation feedback. Experiments on features from SAEs of diverse language models demonstrate that SAGE produces explanations with significantly higher generative and predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines.an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanationdriven process.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了DSPy+HELM框架，通过结构化提示方法实现更准确的语言模型性能评估，发现传统HELM基准测试会低估模型性能并导致排名错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型基准测试框架（如HELM）使用固定提示，无法泛化到不同模型，导致性能估计不准确，需要估计每个模型的上限性能。

Method: 开发了可复现的DSPy+HELM框架，引入四种结构化提示方法（包括推理链），在7个基准测试上评估4个前沿语言模型。

Result: 发现：HELM低估模型性能4%；性能估计方差增加2%；3/7基准测试排名反转；推理链提示降低模型对提示设计的敏感性。

Conclusion: 这是首个大规模实证研究，表明可扩展的性能上限估计能提供更有决策价值的基准测试，并开源了相关工具。

Abstract: As language models (LMs) are increasingly adopted across domains, high-quality benchmarking frameworks that accurately estimate performance are essential for guiding deployment decisions. While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we estimate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing reasoning (chain-of-thought) reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller Δ across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale benchmarking study to empirically characterize LM behavior across benchmarks and prompting methods, showing that scalable performance ceiling estimation enables more decision-useful benchmarks. We open-source (i) DSPy+HELM Integration (https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm/pull/3893) and (ii) Prompt Optimization Pipeline (https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/dspy-helm).

TL;DR: 提出一种新的Length-MAX分词器，通过最小化平均字符数来减少训练和推理时的token数量，相比BPE在多种词汇表大小下减少13-18%的token，显著提升训练效率和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词器如BPE主要基于频率优化，但未充分考虑token长度对效率的影响。本文旨在开发一种能最小化平均字符数的分词器，以提高语言模型的训练和推理效率。

Method: 将长度加权目标最大化建模为图划分问题，并开发贪心近似算法来获取词汇表，从而最小化平均token长度。

Result: 相比BPE减少14-18%的token数量，GPT-2模型训练步骤减少17-18%，推理延迟降低13-14%，下游任务性能提升（LAMBADA困惑度降低11.7%，HellaSwag准确率提高4.3%），词汇覆盖率达99.62%。

Conclusion: 优化平均token长度而非仅频率，是实现更高效语言建模的有效方法，在不牺牲下游性能的情况下显著提升效率，且与生产系统兼容。

Abstract: We introduce a new tokenizer for language models that minimizes the average tokens per character, thereby reducing the number of tokens needed to represent text during training and to generate text during inference. Our method, which we refer to as the Length-MAX tokenizer, obtains its vocabulary by casting a length-weighted objective maximization as a graph partitioning problem and developing a greedy approximation algorithm. On FineWeb and diverse domains, it yields 14--18\% fewer tokens than Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) across vocabulary sizes from 10K to 50K, and the reduction is 13.0\% when the size is 64K. Training GPT-2 models at 124M, 355M, and 1.3B parameters from scratch with five runs each shows 18.5\%, 17.2\%, and 18.5\% fewer steps, respectively, to reach a fixed validation loss, and 13.7\%, 12.7\%, and 13.7\% lower inference latency, together with a 16\% throughput gain at 124M, while consistently improving on downstream tasks including reducing LAMBADA perplexity by 11.7\% and enhancing HellaSwag accuracy by 4.3\%. Moreover, the Length-MAX tokenizer achieves 99.62\% vocabulary coverage and the out-of-vocabulary rate remains low at 0.12\% on test sets. These results demonstrate that optimizing for average token length, rather than frequency alone, offers an effective approach to more efficient language modeling without sacrificing -- and often improving -- downstream performance. The tokenizer is compatible with production systems and reduces embedding and KV-cache memory by 18\% at inference.

TL;DR: Evo-Memory是一个用于评估LLM智能体自进化记忆能力的流式基准测试框架，通过序列化任务流要求LLM在每次交互后搜索、适应和进化记忆，填补了现有评估在动态记忆积累和重用方面的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注静态对话场景，忽视了LLM智能体在连续任务流中积累和重用经验的动态能力，而现实世界环境如交互式问题助手或具身智能体需要LLM能够从累积交互中学习。

Method: 构建了包含10个多样化多轮目标导向和单轮推理问答数据集的序列化任务流，统一实现了10多种代表性记忆模块，并提出了ExpRAG基线方法和ReMem行动-思考-记忆优化管道。

Result: Evo-Memory框架能够系统评估LLM智能体在流式任务环境中的记忆管理能力，为测试时进化提供标准化基准。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM智能体的动态记忆评估提供了重要工具，推动了智能体在连续交互环境中学习和适应能力的发展。

Abstract: Statefulness is essential for large language model (LLM) agents to perform long-term planning and problem-solving. This makes memory a critical component, yet its management and evolution remain largely underexplored. Existing evaluations mostly focus on static conversational settings, where memory is passively retrieved from dialogue to answer queries, overlooking the dynamic ability to accumulate and reuse experience across evolving task streams. In real-world environments such as interactive problem assistants or embodied agents, LLMs are required to handle continuous task streams, yet often fail to learn from accumulated interactions, losing valuable contextual insights, a limitation that calls for test-time evolution, where LLMs retrieve, integrate, and update memory continuously during deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce Evo-Memory, a comprehensive streaming benchmark and framework for evaluating self-evolving memory in LLM agents. Evo-Memory structures datasets into sequential task streams, requiring LLMs to search, adapt, and evolve memory after each interaction. We unify and implement over ten representative memory modules and evaluate them across 10 diverse multi-turn goal-oriented and single-turn reasoning and QA datasets. To better benchmark experience reuse, we provide a baseline method, ExpRAG, for retrieving and utilizing prior experience, and further propose ReMem, an action-think-memory refine pipeline that tightly integrates reasoning, task actions, and memory updates to achieve continual improvement.

TL;DR: 本文研究跨语言论证挖掘方法，针对低资源语言（波斯语）构建三种训练场景：零样本迁移、LLM增强和跨语言混合模型，发现轻量级跨语言方法优于资源密集的增强方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言在论证挖掘任务中的数据短缺问题，探索有效的跨语言迁移方法。

Method: 构建三种训练场景：1）仅用英语数据训练的零样本迁移；2）LLM生成合成样本增强的英语训练；3）结合英语数据和人工翻译波斯语句子的跨语言模型。

Result: 零样本迁移模型在英语和波斯语测试集上的F1分别为50.2%和50.7%；LLM增强模型提升至59.2%（英语）和69.3%（波斯语）；跨语言模型在波斯语测试集上达到74.8%的F1。

Conclusion: 轻量级跨语言混合方法显著优于资源密集的增强管道，为低资源语言的论证挖掘任务提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Argument mining is a subfield of natural language processing to identify and extract the argument components, like premises and conclusions, within a text and to recognize the relations between them. It reveals the logical structure of texts to be used in tasks like knowledge extraction. This paper aims at utilizing a cross-lingual approach to argument mining for low-resource languages, by constructing three training scenarios. We examine the models on English, as a high-resource language, and Persian, as a low-resource language. To this end, we evaluate the models based on the English Microtext corpus \citep{PeldszusStede2015}, and its parallel Persian translation. The learning scenarios are as follow: (i) zero-shot transfer, where the model is trained solely with the English data, (ii) English-only training enhanced by synthetic examples generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), and (iii) a cross-lingual model that combines the original English data with manually translated Persian sentences. The zero-shot transfer model attains F1 scores of 50.2\% on the English test set and 50.7\% on the Persian test set. LLM-based augmentation model improves the performance up to 59.2\% on English and 69.3\% on Persian. The cross-lingual model, trained on both languages but evaluated solely on the Persian test set, surpasses the LLM-based variant, by achieving a F1 of 74.8\%. Results indicate that a lightweight cross-lingual blend can outperform considerably the more resource-intensive augmentation pipelines, and it offers a practical pathway for the argument mining task to overcome data resource shortage on low-resource languages.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合角色交叉最小对、时间涌现分析和跨模型比较的方法，研究LLM如何实现语义角色，发现LLM形成紧凑、因果隔离的抽象语义结构机制，这些机制在不同规模和架构间存在部分迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型显示出语义能力，但其内部实现抽象语义结构的机制仍未被充分表征。

Method: 整合角色交叉最小对、时间涌现分析和跨模型比较的方法来研究LLM如何实现语义角色。

Result: 发现：(i)高度集中的电路（89-94%归因在28个节点内）；(ii)渐进结构精炼而非相变，较大模型有时绕过局部电路；(iii)中等跨尺度守恒（24-59%组件重叠）和高光谱相似性。

Conclusion: LLM形成紧凑、因果隔离的抽象语义结构机制，这些机制在不同规模和架构间存在部分迁移。

Abstract: Despite displaying semantic competence, large language models' internal mechanisms that ground abstract semantic structure remain insufficiently characterised. We propose a method integrating role-cross minimal pairs, temporal emergence analysis, and cross-model comparison to study how LLMs implement semantic roles. Our analysis uncovers: (i) highly concentrated circuits (89-94% attribution within 28 nodes); (ii) gradual structural refinement rather than phase transitions, with larger models sometimes bypassing localised circuits; and (iii) moderate cross-scale conservation (24-59% component overlap) alongside high spectral similarity. These findings suggest that LLMs form compact, causally isolated mechanisms for abstract semantic structure, and these mechanisms exhibit partial transfer across scales and architectures.

TL;DR: Chatty-KG是一个用于知识图谱对话问答的多智能体系统，结合了检索增强生成和结构化查询执行，在单轮和多轮对话中都显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识图谱问答系统存在局限性：检索增强生成系统会序列化图结构且难以处理多轮上下文，传统KGQA系统通常只支持单轮问答且延迟高、难以处理指代消解。需要结合对话灵活性和结构化知识图谱的优势。

Method: 采用模块化多智能体系统，通过专门任务的LLM智能体协作实现上下文解释、对话跟踪、实体关系链接和高效查询规划，将自然语言问题翻译成可执行的SPARQL查询。

Result: 在大型多样化知识图谱上的实验表明，Chatty-KG在单轮和多轮设置下都显著优于最先进的基线方法，获得了更高的F1和P@1分数。

Conclusion: Chatty-KG统一了对话灵活性和结构化知识图谱基础，为可靠的多轮KGQA提供了可扩展和可扩展的方法，无需微调或预处理即可支持演进的知识图谱。

Abstract: Conversational Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) combines the factual grounding of KG-based QA with the interactive nature of dialogue systems. KGs are widely used in enterprise and domain applications to provide structured, evolving, and reliable knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) enable natural and context-aware conversations, but lack direct access to private and dynamic KGs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can retrieve graph content but often serialize structure, struggle with multi-turn context, and require heavy indexing. Traditional KGQA systems preserve structure but typically support only single-turn QA, incur high latency, and struggle with coreference and context tracking. To address these limitations, we propose Chatty-KG, a modular multi-agent system for conversational QA over KGs. Chatty-KG combines RAG-style retrieval with structured execution by generating SPARQL queries through task-specialized LLM agents. These agents collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity and relation linking, and efficient query planning, enabling accurate and low-latency translation of natural questions into executable queries. Experiments on large and diverse KGs show that Chatty-KG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, achieving higher F1 and P@1 scores. Its modular design preserves dialogue coherence and supports evolving KGs without fine-tuning or pre-processing. Evaluations with commercial (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0) and open-weight (e.g., Phi-4, Gemma 3) LLMs confirm broad compatibility and stable performance. Overall, Chatty-KG unifies conversational flexibility with structured KG grounding, offering a scalable and extensible approach for reliable multi-turn KGQA.

*Ioana Buhnila,Aman Sinha,Mathieu Constant*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在定义类问题上表现最佳，但在举例说明类问题上表现最差。预训练数据影响LLMs对多样化语言查询的回答质量，高频概念比低频技术概念更容易被释义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在处理除定义类查询外的其他类型回答（如举例、释义等）时的性能下降，研究预训练数据对LLMs回答多样化语言查询的影响。

Method: 使用TrackList细粒度语言和统计分析管道，引入RefoMed-EN数据集（6170个人工标注的医学术语及其定义、命名、举例、解释或释义），通过句法和语义相似度指标、统计相关性和嵌入来评估LLM输出质量。

Result: LLMs在定义类问题上的任务性能最高，在举例说明类问题上最低。对于定义类问题，大型语言模型倾向于对流行和频繁知识进行更多释义，而对尾部和技术知识（特别是在专业文本中）进行较少释义。

Conclusion: LLMs在处理非定义类查询时存在性能差距，预训练数据的频率分布影响模型对不同类型知识的处理能力，需要改进模型以更好地处理多样化语言查询。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven efficient in giving definition-type answers to user input queries. While for humans giving various types of answers, such as examples and paraphrases, is an easy task, LLMs struggle to provide correct answers for other than definition-type queries. In this study, we evaluated this drop in performance using TrackList, a fine-grained linguistic and statistical analysis pipeline to investigate the impact of the pre-training data on LLMs answers to diverse linguistic queries. We also introduce RefoMed-EN, an English dataset consisting of 6170 human-annotated medical terms alongside their corresponding definitions, denominations, exemplifications, explanations, or paraphrases. We studied whether the high frequency of a concept (head) or low frequency (tail) impacts the language model's performance. We evaluated the quality of the LLM's output using syntactic and semantic similarity metrics, statistical correlations and embeddings. Results showed that the LLM's task performance for definition type questions is the highest, while for the exemplification type it is the lowest. Additionally, we showed that for definition-type questions, large language models are prone to paraphrase more on popular and frequent knowledge and less on tail and technical knowledge, especially in the expert texts.

*Anantha Padmanaban Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，上下文学习(ICL)无法覆盖预训练的标签语义，而是主要调整输入如何映射到预训练期间学习的稳定语义方向，揭示了少样本提示的基本限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究ICL是否能覆盖预训练的标签语义，还是仅仅细化现有的语义骨干。

Method: 将LLMs视为提示诱导分类器，对比自然演示（正确标签）和反转演示（系统翻转标签含义）下的行为，分解ICL行为为三个对齐指标（真值、先验和提示对齐），并引入语义覆盖率。

Result: 在8个分类任务和8个开源LLM上，发现ICL在自然演示下提高准确性但保持强先验对齐；在反转演示下，模型无法学习连贯的反语义分类器，语义覆盖率在少样本设置中保持为零。

Conclusion: ICL主要调整输入如何投影到预训练期间学习的稳定语义方向，而非灵活重新映射标签含义，表明在这些规模上覆盖标签语义需要超越ICL的干预措施。

Abstract: Can in-context learning (ICL) override pre-trained label semantics, or does it merely refine an existing semantic backbone? We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合检索上下文信息的LLM讽刺检测方法，通过非参数知识检索和自知识检索策略，显著提升了讽刺检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 讽刺检测在NLP中仍然具有挑战性，PLMs和LLMs在处理复杂讽刺文本时表现不佳，特别是在涉及文化特定俚语、引用或未知术语时。

Method: 在PMP方法基础上，引入检索感知方法：1) 非参数知识检索（基于网络的检索）；2) 自知识检索（激发模型内部知识）。在三个数据集上进行评估。

Result: 非参数检索在Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic数据集上比原始PMP方法提升9.87% macro-F1；自知识检索在Semeval和MUStARD上分别提升3.29%和4.08% macro-F1。

Conclusion: 上下文信息对提升LLMs在讽刺检测任务中的性能至关重要，特别是涉及文化特定内容时。未来工作将优化相关上下文信息的检索。

Abstract: Detecting sarcasm remains a challenging task in the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) despite recent advances in neural network approaches. Currently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are the preferred approach for sarcasm detection. However, the complexity of sarcastic text, combined with linguistic diversity and cultural variation across communities, has made the task more difficult even for PLMs and LLMs. Beyond that, those models also exhibit unreliable detection of words or tokens that require extra grounding for analysis. Building on a state-of-the-art prompting method in LLMs for sarcasm detection called Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP), we introduce a retrieval-aware approach that incorporates retrieved contextual information for each target text. Our pipeline explores two complementary ways to provide context: adding non-parametric knowledge using web-based retrieval when the model lacks necessary background, and eliciting the model's own internal knowledge for a self-knowledge awareness strategy. We evaluated our approach with three datasets, such as Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic, SemEval-2018 Task 3, and MUStARD. Non-parametric retrieval resulted in a significant 9.87% macro-F1 improvement on Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic compared to the original PMP method. Self-knowledge retrieval improves macro-F1 by 3.29% on Semeval and by 4.08% on MUStARD. These findings highlight the importance of context in enhancing LLMs performance in sarcasm detection task, particularly the involvement of culturally specific slang, references, or unknown terms to the LLMs. Future work will focus on optimizing the retrieval of relevant contextual information and examining how retrieval quality affects performance. The experiment code is available at: https://github.com/wllchrst/sarcasm-detection_pmp_knowledge-base.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探索了在缅甸语等低资源语言分类任务中使用Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)替代传统MLP分类头的方法。实验表明KANs在性能和效率上具有竞争力，其中EfficientKAN与fastText结合获得了最高F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源语言分类任务中，通常只微调最后的分类层而冻结预训练编码器权重。传统的MLP分类头存在固定非线性限制表达能力和增加计算成本的问题，因此需要寻找更好的替代方案。

Method: 评估了三种KAN变体作为分类头：基于傅里叶的FourierKAN、基于样条的EfficientKAN和基于网格的FasterKAN，使用多种嵌入方法包括TF-IDF、fastText和多语言变换器（mBERT、Distil-mBERT）。

Result: 实验结果显示KAN-based分类头与MLPs相当或更优。EfficientKAN与fastText组合获得最高F1分数（0.928），FasterKAN在速度和准确性之间提供了最佳平衡。在变换器嵌入上，EfficientKAN与mBERT匹配或略微优于MLPs（0.917 F1）。

Conclusion: KANs是低资源语言分类任务中MLPs的表达能力强、效率高的替代方案，在保持竞争力的同时提供了更好的性能-效率权衡。

Abstract: In low-resource languages like Burmese, classification tasks often fine-tune only the final classification layer, keeping pre-trained encoder weights frozen. While Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are commonly used, their fixed non-linearity can limit expressiveness and increase computational cost. This work explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as alternative classification heads, evaluating Fourier-based FourierKAN, Spline-based EfficientKAN, and Grid-based FasterKAN-across diverse embeddings including TF-IDF, fastText, and multilingual transformers (mBERT, Distil-mBERT). Experimental results show that KAN-based heads are competitive with or superior to MLPs. EfficientKAN with fastText achieved the highest F1-score (0.928), while FasterKAN offered the best trade-off between speed and accuracy. On transformer embeddings, EfficientKAN matched or slightly outperformed MLPs with mBERT (0.917 F1). These findings highlight KANs as expressive, efficient alternatives to MLPs for low-resource language classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估不同架构的大型语言模型在满足硬性拼写约束方面的能力，填补跨架构系统性评估的空白。

Method: 评估了三个模型家族（Qwen3、Claude Haiku-4.5、GPT-5-mini）的28种配置，使用58个需要字符级约束满足的字谜任务，并参考了10,000名人类解谜者的难度评级。

Result: 架构差异产生的性能差距（2.0-2.2倍）远大于家族内参数扩展带来的增益（83%），模型在拼写异常词汇上失败率高达89-96%，而人类成功率达86-95%。

Conclusion: 约束满足可能需要专门的架构特征或训练目标，而不仅仅是参数扩展或计算预算增加，模型过度依赖分布合理性而惩罚拼写异常但有效的模式。

Abstract: Large language models must satisfy hard orthographic constraints during controlled text generation, yet systematic cross-architecture evaluation remains limited. We evaluate 28 configurations spanning three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) on 58 word puzzles requiring character-level constraint satisfaction. Architectural differences produce substantially larger performance gaps (2.0-2.2x, F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) than parameter scaling within families (83% gain from eightfold scaling), suggesting that constraint satisfaction may require specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard language model scaling. Thinking budget sensitivity proves heterogeneous: high-capacity models show strong returns (+0.102 to +0.136 F1), while mid-sized variants saturate or degrade. These patterns are inconsistent with uniform compute benefits. Using difficulty ratings from 10,000 human solvers per puzzle, we establish modest but consistent calibration (r=0.24-0.38) across all families, yet identify systematic failures on common words with unusual orthography ("data", "poop", "loll": 86-95% human success, 89-96% model miss rate). These failures reveal over-reliance on distributional plausibility that penalizes orthographically atypical but constraint-valid patterns, suggesting architectural innovations may be required beyond simply scaling parameters or computational budgets.

Conclusion: 研究证明了AEC的鲁棒性以及在低资源环境下特征设计对于改进ASR输出的重要性。

Abstract: This paper investigates sequence-to-sequence Transformer models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) error correction in low-resource Burmese, focusing on different feature integration strategies including IPA and alignment information. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing ASR error correction specifically for Burmese. We evaluate five ASR backbones and show that our ASR Error Correction (AEC) approaches consistently improve word- and character-level accuracy over baseline outputs. The proposed AEC model, combining IPA and alignment features, reduced the average WER of ASR models from 51.56 to 39.82 before augmentation (and 51.56 to 43.59 after augmentation) and improving chrF++ scores from 0.5864 to 0.627, demonstrating consistent gains over the baseline ASR outputs without AEC. Our results highlight the robustness of AEC and the importance of feature design for improving ASR outputs in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: 双专家架构成功解决了专业领域应用中知识增强与指令保真度的双重挑战，为领域特定大语言模型的发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across general domains, yet their application to specialized sectors such as mortgage finance requires domain-specific knowledge augmentation while preserving instruction-following fidelity. We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself. We validate our approach on domain-specific benchmarks, where our final model (MLM v2) significantly outperforms the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieving an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs. 3.99), a Q&A score of 4.09 (vs. 4.0), and a classification score of 2.6 (vs. 1.2). On semantic similarity, our model achieved a BERTScore of 0.77 for summarization (vs. 0.74), 0.68 for Q&A (vs. 0.58), and 0.75 for classification (vs. 0.73), substantially outperforming baseline approaches.

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness.

*Steven Wang,Kyle Hunt,Shaojie Tang,Kenneth Joseph*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在小型人类调查数据上微调LLM可以改善响应多样性、子群对齐和信念-行动一致性，但即使最佳微调模型也无法复现原始研究的回归系数，因此LLM生成的数据仍不适合替代人类参与者进行正式推断分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨是否通过在小型人类调查数据（如试点研究数据）上微调LLM，能够缓解LLM与真实人类行为不匹配的问题，从而产生更真实的模拟结果。

Method: 使用信息披露行为实验，比较人类和LLM生成响应在多个维度上的差异，包括分布差异、子群对齐、信念-行动一致性和回归系数恢复能力。

Result: 在小型人类样本上微调显著改善了基础模型的异质性、对齐性和信念-行动一致性，但即使最佳微调模型也无法复现原始研究的回归系数。

Conclusion: LLM生成的数据仍不适合替代人类参与者进行正式推断分析，尽管微调能在某些方面改善模拟效果。

Abstract: There is ongoing debate about whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as substitutes for human participants in survey and experimental research. While recent work in fields such as marketing and psychology has explored the potential of LLM-based simulation, a growing body of evidence cautions against this practice: LLMs often fail to align with real human behavior, exhibiting limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, insufficient within-group variance, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions. This study examines an important and distinct question in this domain: whether fine-tuning on a small subset of human survey data, such as that obtainable from a pilot study, can mitigate these issues and yield realistic simulated outcomes. Using a behavioral experiment on information disclosure, we compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions, including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and the recovery of regression coefficients. We find that fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improves heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models fail to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study, suggesting that LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.

TL;DR: 开发了首个伊桑语开放对话语音数据集，包含自然对话语音而非朗读语音，解决了伊桑语缺乏标准正字法的挑战，建立了实用的转录协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伊桑语是泰国最广泛使用的地区方言，但现有语音语料库主要是朗读或脚本语音，缺乏自然对话语音资源，且伊桑语缺乏标准化正字法，转录实践差异很大。

Method: 建立实用的转录协议，在表征准确性和计算处理需求之间取得平衡，收集自然对话语音而非朗读语音。

Result: 创建了首个伊桑语开放对话语音数据集，捕捉了真实的语言现象如口语化表达、自发韵律、不流畅性和与泰语频繁的语码转换。

Conclusion: 该开放数据集有助于包容性AI发展，支持对代表性不足语言的研究，并为建模对话语音的语言和技术挑战提供基础。

Abstract: This paper introduces the development of the first open conversational speech dataset for the Isan language, the most widely spoken regional dialect in Thailand. Unlike existing speech corpora that are primarily based on read or scripted speech, this dataset consists of natural speech, thereby capturing authentic linguistic phenomena such as colloquials, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and frequent code-switching with central Thai. A key challenge in building this resource lies in the lack of a standardized orthography for Isan. Current writing practices vary considerably, due to the different lexical tones between Thai and Isan. This variability complicates the design of transcription guidelines and poses questions regarding consistency, usability, and linguistic authenticity. To address these issues, we establish practical transcription protocols that balance the need for representational accuracy with the requirements of computational processing. By releasing this dataset as an open resource, we aim to contribute to inclusive AI development, support research on underrepresented languages, and provide a basis for addressing the linguistic and technical challenges inherent in modeling conversational speech.

TL;DR: PEFT-Bench是一个统一的端到端基准测试，用于评估自回归大语言模型上的多种参数高效微调方法，包含27个NLP数据集和6种PEFT方法，并提出了考虑可训练参数、推理速度和训练内存使用的PSCP指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在许多任务上取得了最先进的性能，但其巨大规模导致高计算和环境成本，限制了可访问性。当前PEFT方法的评估仍然有限且难以复现。

Method: 提出了PEFT-Bench基准测试框架，在27个NLP数据集和6种PEFT方法上进行评估，并引入PSCP指标综合考虑可训练参数、推理速度和训练内存使用。

Result: 构建了一个统一的评估框架，能够系统地比较不同PEFT方法的性能表现，考虑了实际部署中的多个重要因素。

Conclusion: PEFT-Bench填补了当前PEFT方法评估的空白，提供了一个可复现且全面的基准测试平台，有助于推动参数高效微调技术的发展和应用。

Abstract: Despite the state-of-the-art performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) achieved on many tasks, their massive scale often leads to high computational and environmental costs, limiting their accessibility. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods address this challenge by reducing the number of trainable parameters while maintaining strong downstream performance. Despite the increased development in PEFT methods, current evaluations remain limited (in terms of evaluated models and datasets) and difficult to reproduce. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEFT-Bench, a unified end-to-end benchmark for evaluating diverse PEFT methods on autoregressive LLMs. We demonstrate its usage across 27 NLP datasets and 6 PEFT methods. To account for different PEFT training and inference factors, we also introduce the PEFT Soft Score Penalties (PSCP) metric, which takes trainable parameters, inference speed, and training memory usage into account.

*Kai Kugler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 首次系统研究神经网络语言模型训练过程中生成的文本是否遵循Martin定律（词频与多义性关系），发现该规律在训练过程中呈现非单调发展轨迹，存在最佳语义窗口。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络语言模型在训练过程中是否能够自发地学习到人类语言中的统计规律（如Martin定律），以及这些规律如何随着训练进程演变。

Method: 使用DBSCAN聚类上下文嵌入作为词义操作化方法，分析四个Pythia模型（70M-1B参数）在30个训练检查点上的表现。

Result: Martin定律在检查点100左右出现，在检查点104达到峰值相关性（r>0.6），然后在检查点105退化。小模型在后期检查点经历灾难性语义崩溃，而大模型表现出优雅退化。频率-特异性权衡在所有模型中保持稳定（r≈-0.3）。

Conclusion: LLM生成文本对语言规律的遵循并非随训练单调增加，而是遵循平衡轨迹，存在最佳语义窗口。这为评估神经网络语言模型中涌现的语言结构提供了新方法。

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of Martin's Law - the empirical relationship between word frequency and polysemy - in text generated by neural language models during training. Using DBSCAN clustering of contextualized embeddings as an operationalization of word senses, we analyze four Pythia models (70M-1B parameters) across 30 training checkpoints. Our results reveal a non-monotonic developmental trajectory: Martin's Law emerges around checkpoint 100, reaches peak correlation (r > 0.6) at checkpoint 104, then degrades by checkpoint 105. Smaller models (70M, 160M) experience catastrophic semantic collapse at late checkpoints, while larger models (410M, 1B) show graceful degradation. The frequency-specificity trade-off remains stable (r $\approx$ -0.3) across all models. These findings suggest that compliance with linguistic regularities in LLM-generated text is not monotonically increasing with training, but instead follows a balanced trajectory with an optimal semantic window. This work establishes a novel methodology for evaluating emergent linguistic structure in neural language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过微调训练，7B参数模型从近乎完全失败转变为可靠检测单令牌注入的"思想"，准确率达85%，零误报，满足Lindsey提出的准确性、基础性和内部性标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Lindsey提出的开放性问题：是否可以通过训练消除模型间内省能力的差异，探索直接训练内省行为而非等待其自然涌现的可能性。

Method: 通过对瞬态单令牌注入进行微调，训练模型检测和识别注入的激活模式，并保留信息在后续生成步骤中报告语义内容。

Result: 模型从0.4%准确率、6.7%误报率提升到85%准确率（α=40）、0%误报率，能够检测单令牌位置的瞬时"思想"并泛化到未见过的概念向量。

Conclusion: 至少一种内省行为组件可以直接通过训练诱导，为构建内置AI透明度提供了可行路径，但尚未确立Lindsey意义上的元认知表征。

Abstract: Lindsey (2025) investigates introspective awareness in language models through four experiments, finding that models can sometimes detect and identify injected activation patterns -- but unreliably (~20% success in the best model). We focus on the first of these experiments -- self-report of injected "thoughts" -- and ask whether this capability can be directly trained rather than waiting for emergence. Through fine-tuning on transient single-token injections, we transform a 7B parameter model from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy, 6.7% false positive rate) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts at α=40, 0% false positives). Our model detects fleeting "thoughts" injected at a single token position, retains that information, and reports the semantic content across subsequent generation steps. On this task, our trained model satisfies three of Lindsey's criteria: accuracy (correct identification), grounding (0/60 false positives), and internality (detection precedes verbalization). Generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap) demonstrates the model learns a transferable skill rather than memorizing specific vectors, though this does not establish metacognitive representation in Lindsey's sense. These results address an open question raised by Lindsey: whether "training for introspection would help eliminate cross-model differences." We show that at least one component of introspective behavior can be directly induced, offering a pathway to built-in AI transparency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文创建了捷克语和斯洛伐克语的细粒度证据提取数据集，评估了大型语言模型在证据提取任务上的表现，发现模型经常无法逐字复制源文本中的证据，导致输出无效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线新闻文章的用户评论中经常传播错误信息，需要有效的方法来检测事实不正确的信息，这需要识别相关文档并精确定位支持或反驳每个主张的确切文本片段。

Method: 创建了由付费标注人员标注的双向细粒度证据数据集，并评估了多种大型语言模型在该数据集上的表现，分析模型输出与人工标注的一致性。

Result: 结果显示LLMs经常无法逐字复制源文本中的证据，导致无效输出。llama3.1:8b模型尽管规模较小但正确输出比例高，而gpt-oss-120b模型尽管参数更多但表现不佳。qwen3:14b、deepseek-r1:32b和gpt-oss:20b模型在模型大小和与人工标注一致性之间达到了有效平衡。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在细粒度证据提取任务中经常无法准确复制源文本证据，模型大小与性能之间并非简单的正相关关系，某些中等规模模型在准确性和效率之间达到了更好的平衡。

Abstract: Misinformation frequently spreads in user comments under online news articles, highlighting the need for effective methods to detect factually incorrect information. To strongly support or refute claims extracted from such comments, it is necessary to identify relevant documents and pinpoint the exact text spans that justify or contradict each claim. This paper focuses on the latter task -- fine-grained evidence extraction for Czech and Slovak claims. We create new dataset, containing two-way annotated fine-grained evidence created by paid annotators. We evaluate large language models (LLMs) on this dataset to assess their alignment with human annotations. The results reveal that LLMs often fail to copy evidence verbatim from the source text, leading to invalid outputs. Error-rate analysis shows that the {llama3.1:8b model achieves a high proportion of correct outputs despite its relatively small size, while the gpt-oss-120b model underperforms despite having many more parameters. Furthermore, the models qwen3:14b, deepseek-r1:32b, and gpt-oss:20b demonstrate an effective balance between model size and alignment with human annotations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DSR-SQL是一个双状态推理框架，通过上下文状态和生成状态的交互来解决复杂企业数据库中的Text-to-SQL问题，无需后训练或上下文示例就能达到竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分治推理方法在处理复杂企业数据库时，由于上下文容量有限、模式链接不可靠以及数据库语义基础薄弱，难以保持连贯推理。

Method: 引入双状态推理框架：自适应上下文状态通过精炼大型模式和选择相关结构构建紧凑的语义忠实环境；渐进生成状态将SQL合成形式化为反馈引导的状态转换，使模型能够自我纠正并与用户意图对齐。

Result: 在Spider 2.0-Snow上达到35.28%的执行准确率，在BIRD开发集上达到68.32%的执行准确率。

Conclusion: DSR-SQL框架有效解决了复杂企业数据库中的Text-to-SQL挑战，通过双状态交互实现了语义忠实的环境构建和反馈引导的SQL生成。

Abstract: Recent divide-and-conquer reasoning approaches, particularly those based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT), have substantially improved the Text-to-SQL capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, when applied to complex enterprise databases, such methods struggle to maintain coherent reasoning due to limited context capacity, unreliable schema linking, and weak grounding in database semantics. To overcome these issues, we introduce DSR-SQL, a \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tate \textbf{R}easoning framework that models Text-to-SQL as an interaction between an adaptive context state and a progressive generation state. The first constructs a compact, semantically faithful environment by refining large schemas and selecting relevant structures, while the second formalizes SQL synthesis as feedback-guided state transitions, enabling the model to self-correct and align with user intent. Without any post-training or in-context examples, DSR-SQL achieves competitive performance, reaching 35.28\% execution accuracy on Spider 2.0-Snow and 68.32\% on BIRD development set. Our implementation will be open-sourced at: https://github.com/DMIRLAB-Group/DSR-SQL.

TL;DR: Odin是一个新的图文本集成架构，通过定向双模块机制在特定Transformer层注入图结构，避免GNN的过平滑问题，同时保留Transformer的语义理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖GNN（存在过平滑和跳数依赖扩散问题），要么使用Transformer（忽略图拓扑结构），需要一种能有效结合文本理解和结构推理的新方法。

Method: 提出Odin架构，在特定Transformer层通过定向双模块机制注入图结构，多跳结构在不同层集成，形成与语义层次对齐的结构抽象。还提出轻量版Light Odin用于大规模或低资源场景。

Result: 在多个文本丰富的图基准测试中，Odin达到最先进准确率，Light Odin以显著降低的计算成本提供有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: Odin和Light Odin形成了一个统一的、无跳数的结构-文本集成框架，其表达能力严格包含纯Transformer和GNN。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs require models to effectively combine strong textual understanding with structurally informed reasoning. Existing approaches either rely on GNNs--limited by over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion--or employ Transformers that overlook graph topology and treat nodes as isolated sequences. We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference. Experiments on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks show that Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost. Together, Odin and Light Odin form a unified, hop-free framework for principled structure-text integration. The source code of this model has been released at https://github.com/hongkaifeng/Odin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型合并无需额外训练即可将多个微调检查点合并为单一模型，但尚不清楚小模型和分类器上的优势是否能推广到LLM。

Method: 对六种最先进的合并方法（包括子空间方法）在四个开源LLM、每个基础模型十二个微调检查点和十六个标准LLM基准上进行系统评估。

Result: Task Arithmetic是唯一可靠提升性能的方法，其他干扰感知和子空间合并方法通常导致显著性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前合并技术不能直接迁移到现代LLM，需要设计LLM特定的合并算法和合并感知的微调方法。

Abstract: Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned checkpoints into a single model without additional training, offering an attractive approach to reusing models and efficiently improving performance. However, it remains unclear whether the advantages reported for smaller models and classifiers generalize to LLMs. We present a large-scale, systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art merging methods, including recent subspace methods, across four open-weight LLMs, twelve fine-tuned checkpoints per base model, and sixteen standard LLM benchmarks. Evaluating through standardized benchmarks, we measure both the probability that a merged model outperforms the base model and relative gains over the best individual checkpoint. Our results show that the oldest and simplest method, Task Arithmetic, is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops. Our findings indicate that current merging techniques do not directly transfer to modern LLMs. This motivates the design of LLM-specific merging algorithms and merging-aware fine-tuning methods. Code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.

Conclusion: 提出的双向可读性评估机制能够有效考虑文本长度和可读性标签的序数关系，在跨语言数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: Readability assessment aims to evaluate the reading difficulty of a text. In recent years, while deep learning technology has been gradually applied to readability assessment, most approaches fail to consider either the length of the text or the ordinal relationship of readability labels. This paper proposes a bidirectional readability assessment mechanism that captures contextual information to identify regions with rich semantic information in the text, thereby predicting the readability level of individual sentences. These sentence-level labels are then used to assist in predicting the overall readability level of the document. Additionally, a pairwise sorting algorithm is introduced to model the ordinal relationship between readability levels through label subtraction. Experimental results on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance and outperforms other baseline models.

TL;DR: 本文研究了语音翻译模型中性别分配的机制，发现在处理说话者指称术语时，模型不仅复制训练数据中的性别关联，还学习更广泛的男性主导模式。模型能够基于声学输入覆盖内部语言模型的男性偏见，并揭示了一种新的机制：使用第一人称代词将性别化术语与说话者关联，从频谱中获取性别信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音翻译中，说话者的声学特征（如音高）可能影响性别模糊术语的语法性别分配，这可能导致对说话者的性别误判。目前对语音翻译模型如何做出这些决策的理解还很有限。

Method: 研究三个语言对（英-西/法/意）的语音翻译模型，分析训练数据模式、内部语言模型偏见和声学信息的相互作用，使用对比性特征归因分析频谱图。

Result: 模型不简单复制训练数据中的术语特定性别关联，而是学习更广泛的男性主导模式。虽然内部语言模型表现出强烈的男性偏见，但模型能够基于声学输入覆盖这些偏好。发现高性别准确率的模型使用第一人称代词将性别化术语与说话者关联，从整个频率频谱而非仅从音高中获取性别信息。

Conclusion: 语音翻译模型通过复杂的机制处理性别分配，能够利用声学信息来纠正内部语言模型的偏见，并采用新颖的策略从频谱中提取性别信息，这对于理解模型决策过程和减少性别误判具有重要意义。

Abstract: Unlike text, speech conveys information about the speaker, such as gender, through acoustic cues like pitch. This gives rise to modality-specific bias concerns. For example, in speech translation (ST), when translating from languages with notional gender, such as English, into languages where gender-ambiguous terms referring to the speaker are assigned grammatical gender, the speaker's vocal characteristics may play a role in gender assignment. This risks misgendering speakers, whether through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions. Yet, how ST models make these decisions remains poorly understood. We investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-referring terms across three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), examining how training data patterns, internal language model (ILM) biases, and acoustic information interact. We find that models do not simply replicate term-specific gender associations from training data, but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence. While the ILM exhibits strong masculine bias, models can override these preferences based on acoustic input. Using contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms, we reveal that the model with higher gender accuracy relies on a previously unknown mechanism: using first-person pronouns to link gendered terms back to the speaker, accessing gender information distributed across the frequency spectrum rather than concentrated in pitch.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在回答转述问题时表现出不一致性，表明它们依赖表层模式而非真正的语义理解，这限制了模型的可靠性。

Method: 从标准数据集生成转述问题构建RoParQ基准，提出XParaCon评估指标，并实施基于推理的转述感知SFT策略来对齐模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了表层记忆问题，培养了更鲁棒可靠的LLMs，证明了转述感知训练策略的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit inconsistent behavior when answering paraphrased questions, suggesting a reliance on surface-level patterns rather than true semantic understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce RoParQ, a benchmark specifically constructed to evaluate cross-paraphrase consistency in closed-book multiple-choice QA. This benchmark is derived from standard datasets by generating paraphrases via proprietary models and selectively retaining examples that elicit inconsistent confidence from a judge model. We further propose XParaCon, a novel evaluation metric that quantifies a model's robustness by measuring the standard deviation of accuracies across question variants. Additionally, we implement a reasoning-based, paraphrase-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategy designed to align models toward semantic invariance. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted alignment significantly enhances robustness. Notably, fine-tuned lightweight models achieved consistency levels comparable to much larger pre-trained models. These results highlight the efficacy of our approach in mitigating superficial memorization and fostering more robust, reliable LLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效识别大语言模型中编码特定技能的神经元，为理解模型内部机制提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. In this paper, we introduce a simple, lightweight, and broadly applicable method with a focus on isolating neurons that encode specific skills. Building upon prior work that identified "skill neurons" via soft prompt training on classification tasks, our approach extends the analysis to complex scenarios involving multiple skills. We correlate neuron activations with auxiliary metrics -- such as external labels and the model's own confidence score -- thereby uncovering interpretable and task-specific behaviors without the need for manual token aggregation. We empirically validate our method on tasks spanning open-ended text generation and natural language inference, demonstrating its ability to detect neurons that not only drive known skills but also reveal previously unidentified shortcuts in arithmetic reasoning on BigBench.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探索了在LLM预训练中使用多种元数据类型（如文档质量指标）来加速训练，发现细粒度元数据更有效，并提出元数据追加和可学习元标记等方法提升训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究仅关注URL作为元数据信号，本研究旨在探索其他元数据类型是否能带来更大收益，以加速大型语言模型的预训练过程。

Method: 研究了多种元数据类型，引入元数据追加方法（将预测元数据作为辅助任务），并使用可学习元标记配合掩码损失来诱导质量感知的潜在结构。

Result: 发现细粒度元数据（如文档质量指标）能有效加速预训练，元数据追加和可学习元标记方法都能提升训练效率，通过探针分析揭示了元数据如何塑造学习过程。

Conclusion: 研究结果为整合元数据以提升LLM预训练效率和效果提供了实用指南，强调细粒度元数据的重要性。

Abstract: Incorporating metadata in Large Language Models (LLMs) pretraining has recently emerged as a promising approach to accelerate training. However prior work highlighted only one useful signal-URLs, leaving open the question of whether other forms of metadata could yield greater benefits. In this study, we investigate a wider range of metadata types and find other types of metadata, such as fine-grained indicators of document quality that can also accelerate pretraining when prepended. We identify a common feature among effective metadata: they encode information at a finer granularity. We further introduce metadata appending as a means of improving training efficiency, where predicting an appropriate metadata as auxiliary task can help speed up pretraining. In addition, learnable meta-tokens trained with masked loss can recover part of the speedup by inducing quality-aware latent structure. Using probing, we analyze latent representations to understand how metadata shapes learning. Together, these results yield practical guidelines for integrating metadata to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM pretraining.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明AI生成的捷克诗歌与人类作品难以区分，参与者识别准确率仅为45.8%，且存在明显的作者偏见——当认为诗歌是AI创作时评价更低，尽管AI诗歌实际评分相当或更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI在捷克语这种形态复杂、训练数据较少的斯拉夫语言中创作诗歌的能力，以及读者对AI和人类诗歌的识别能力和审美评价差异。

Method: 让捷克母语者识别AI和人类创作的诗歌作者身份，并进行审美评价，使用逻辑回归模型分析识别准确率与审美评价的关系。

Result: 参与者识别准确率接近随机水平(45.8%)，AI诗歌与人类作品难以区分；存在作者偏见——认为AI创作时评价更低，尽管AI诗歌实际评分相当或更高；诗歌喜爱程度与识别准确率负相关。

Conclusion: AI能够在捷克语这种复杂语言中创作出令人信服的诗歌，读者对作者身份的信念与诗歌的审美评价密切相关。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly capable of producing creative texts, yet most studies on AI-generated poetry focus on English -- a language that dominates training data. In this paper, we examine the perception of AI- and human-written Czech poetry. We ask if Czech native speakers are able to identify it and how they aesthetically judge it. Participants performed at chance level when guessing authorship (45.8\% correct on average), indicating that Czech AI-generated poems were largely indistinguishable from human-written ones. Aesthetic evaluations revealed a strong authorship bias: when participants believed a poem was AI-generated, they rated it as less favorably, even though AI poems were in fact rated equally or more favorably than human ones on average. The logistic regression model uncovered that the more the people liked a poem, the less probable was that they accurately assign the authorship. Familiarity with poetry or literary background had no effect on recognition accuracy. Our findings show that AI can convincingly produce poetry even in a morphologically complex, low-resource (with respect of the training data of AI models) Slavic language such as Czech. The results suggest that readers' beliefs about authorship and the aesthetic evaluation of the poem are interconnected.

TL;DR: Matrix是一个去中心化的多代理合成数据生成框架，通过分布式队列传递序列化消息来消除中央协调器瓶颈，在相同硬件资源下实现2-15倍的数据生成吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多代理合成框架依赖中央协调器导致可扩展性瓶颈，或者针对特定领域硬编码限制了灵活性，需要一种能够高效处理大规模协调多代理工作流的数据生成解决方案。

Method: 采用去中心化的对等设计，将控制和数据流表示为通过分布式队列传递的序列化消息，每个任务通过轻量级代理独立推进，计算密集型操作由分布式服务处理，基于Ray构建。

Result: 在多种合成场景（多代理协作对话、基于网络的推理数据提取、客户服务环境中的工具使用轨迹生成）中，Matrix在相同硬件资源下实现了2-15倍的数据生成吞吐量提升，且不损害输出质量。

Conclusion: Matrix框架通过去中心化设计成功解决了多代理合成数据生成的可扩展性和灵活性挑战，为大规模协调工作流提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic data has become increasingly important for training large language models, especially when real data is scarce, expensive, or privacy-sensitive. Many such generation tasks require coordinated multi-agent workflows, where specialized agents collaborate to produce data that is higher quality, more diverse, and structurally richer. However, existing frameworks for multi-agent synthesis often depend on a centralized orchestrator, creating scalability bottlenecks, or are hardcoded for specific domains, limiting flexibility. We present \textbf{Matrix}, a decentralized framework that represents both control and data flow as serialized messages passed through distributed queues. This peer-to-peer design eliminates the central orchestrator. Each task progresses independently through lightweight agents, while compute-intensive operations, such as LLM inference or containerized environments, are handled by distributed services. Built on Ray, Matrix scales to tens of thousands of concurrent agentic workflows and provides a modular, configurable design that enables easy adaptation to a wide range of data generation workflows. We evaluate Matrix across diverse synthesis scenarios, such as multi-agent collaborative dialogue, web-based reasoning data extraction, and tool-use trajectory generation in customer service environments. In all cases, Matrix achieves $2$--$15\times$ higher data generation throughput under identical hardware resources, without compromising output quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在处理深度复杂问题时计算成本高且概念挑战大的问题，探索通过小型编排器管理其他模型和工具来提升智能上限和效率。

Method: 使用强化学习训练小型编排器，包含结果感知、效率感知和用户偏好感知的奖励机制，协调多种智能工具。

Result: 8B参数的Orchestrator模型在HLE上得分37.1%，超越GPT-5（35.1%）且效率提升2.5倍；在tau2-Bench和FRAMES上大幅超越GPT-5，仅使用约30%成本。

Conclusion: 通过轻量级编排模型组合多样化工具，比现有方法更高效有效，为实用可扩展的工具增强推理系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Large language models are powerful generalists, yet solving deep and complex problems such as those of the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) remains both conceptually challenging and computationally expensive. We show that small orchestrators managing other models and a variety of tools can both push the upper bound of intelligence and improve efficiency in solving difficult agentic tasks. We introduce ToolOrchestra, a method for training small orchestrators that coordinate intelligent tools. ToolOrchestra explicitly uses reinforcement learning with outcome-, efficiency-, and user-preference-aware rewards. Using ToolOrchestra, we produce Orchestrator, an 8B model that achieves higher accuracy at lower cost than previous tool-use agents while aligning with user preferences on which tools are to be used for a given query. On HLE, Orchestrator achieves a score of 37.1%, outperforming GPT-5 (35.1%) while being 2.5x more efficient. On tau2-Bench and FRAMES, Orchestrator surpasses GPT-5 by a wide margin while using only about 30% of the cost. Extensive analysis shows that Orchestrator achieves the best trade-off between performance and cost under multiple metrics, and generalizes robustly to unseen tools. These results demonstrate that composing diverse tools with a lightweight orchestration model is both more efficient and more effective than existing methods, paving the way for practical and scalable tool-augmented reasoning systems.

TL;DR: 本文通过系统评估LLM在不同难度任务上的泛化能力，发现跨难度泛化有限，训练数据需要包含多种难度级别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对于训练数据难易程度对LLM性能的影响存在争议，需要更客观、大规模和细粒度的分析来澄清这一问题。

Method: 使用数千个不同LLM的输出和项目反应理论(IRT)对六个数据集中的示例进行难度排序，完全基于LLM能力而非人类主观判断来确定难度等级。

Result: 跨难度泛化通常有限，无论是训练简单数据还是困难数据，都无法在整个难度范围内实现一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: LLM的训练和评估数据需要包含多种难度级别，在难度方面走捷径是有风险的。

Abstract: We investigate how well large language models (LLMs) generalize across different task difficulties, a key question for effective data curation and evaluation. Existing research is mixed regarding whether training on easier or harder data leads to better results, and whether those gains come on easier or harder test data. We address this question by conducting a systematic evaluation of LLMs' generalization across models, datasets, and fine-grained groups of example difficulty. We rank examples in six datasets using the outputs of thousands of different LLMs and Item Response Theory (IRT), a well-established difficulty metric in educational testing. Unlike prior work, our difficulty ratings are therefore determined solely by the abilities of many different LLMs, excluding human opinions of difficulty. With a more objective, larger-scale, and finer-grained analysis, we show that cross-difficulty generalization is often limited; training on either easy or hard data cannot achieve consistent improvements across the full range of difficulties. These results show the importance of having a range of difficulties in both training and evaluation data for LLMs, and that taking shortcuts with respect to difficulty is risky.

TL;DR: OVAL-Grasp是一个零样本开放词汇的任务导向抓取方法，使用大语言模型和视觉语言模型让机器人根据任务抓取物体的正确部位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于几何的方法在处理视觉定义部位、遮挡和未见物体时存在困难，需要任务导向的抓取方法来针对特定任务抓取物体部位。

Method: 给定RGB图像和任务，使用LLM识别要抓取或避免的部位，用VLM进行分割，在物体上生成可操作区域的2D热图。

Result: 在20个家居物体的3个独特任务实验中优于两个基线方法，正确识别和分割物体部位成功率95%，真实实验中正确抓取可操作区域成功率78.3%，在遮挡场景中部位选择成功率80%。

Conclusion: OVAL-Grasp在任务导向抓取中表现出色，特别是在处理遮挡和依赖视觉特征选择部位的场景中，模块化设计具有优势。

Abstract: To manipulate objects in novel, unstructured environments, robots need task-oriented grasps that target object parts based on the given task. Geometry-based methods often struggle with visually defined parts, occlusions, and unseen objects. We introduce OVAL-Grasp, a zero-shot open-vocabulary approach to task-oriented, affordance based grasping that uses large-language models and vision-language models to allow a robot to grasp objects at the correct part according to a given task. Given an RGB image and a task, OVAL-Grasp identifies parts to grasp or avoid with an LLM, segments them with a VLM, and generates a 2D heatmap of actionable regions on the object. During our evaluations, we found that our method outperformed two task oriented grasping baselines on experiments with 20 household objects with 3 unique tasks for each. OVAL-Grasp successfully identifies and segments the correct object part 95% of the time and grasps the correct actionable area 78.3% of the time in real-world experiments with the Fetch mobile manipulator. Additionally, OVAL-Grasp finds correct object parts under partial occlusions, demonstrating a part selection success rate of 80% in cluttered scenes. We also demonstrate OVAL-Grasp's efficacy in scenarios that rely on visual features for part selection, and show the benefit of a modular design through our ablation experiments.

Abstract: Teleoperation systems are essential for efficiently collecting diverse and high-quality robot demonstration data, especially for complex, contact-rich tasks. However, current teleoperation platforms typically lack integrated force feedback, cross-embodiment generalization, and portable, user-friendly designs, limiting their practical deployment. To address these limitations, we introduce ACE-F, a cross embodiment foldable teleoperation system with integrated force feedback. Our approach leverages inverse kinematics (IK) combined with a carefully designed human-robot interface (HRI), enabling users to capture precise and high-quality demonstrations effortlessly. We further propose a generalized soft-controller pipeline integrating PD control and inverse dynamics to ensure robot safety and precise motion control across diverse robotic embodiments. Critically, to achieve cross-embodiment generalization of force feedback without additional sensors, we innovatively interpret end-effector positional deviations as virtual force signals, which enhance data collection and enable applications in imitation learning. Extensive teleoperation experiments confirm that ACE-F significantly simplifies the control of various robot embodiments, making dexterous manipulation tasks as intuitive as operating a computer mouse.

Motivation: 图像帧通常包含大量特征，其中许多对于定位是冗余或无信息的。处理所有特征会引入显著的计算延迟和低效率，因此需要智能特征选择来识别在预测范围内对定位最有效的特征子集。

Method: 提出了两种快速且内存高效的特征选择算法，旨在降低时间和内存复杂度，在计算效率和定位精度之间实现有利的权衡。

Result: 与现有高计算和内存需求的方法不同，所提出的方法在减少时间和内存复杂度的同时，保持了良好的定位精度。

Conclusion: 该工作为机器人视觉定位提供了实用的特征选择解决方案，能够在实时应用中有效平衡计算效率和定位性能。

Abstract: Robot localization is a fundamental component of autonomous navigation in unknown environments. Among various sensing modalities, visual input from cameras plays a central role, enabling robots to estimate their position by tracking point features across image frames. However, image frames often contain a large number of features, many of which are redundant or uninformative for localization. Processing all features can introduce significant computational latency and inefficiency. This motivates the need for intelligent feature selection, identifying a subset of features that are most informative for localization over a prediction horizon. In this work, we propose two fast and memory-efficient feature selection algorithms that enable robots to actively evaluate the utility of visual features in real time. Unlike existing approaches with high computational and memory demands, the proposed methods are explicitly designed to reduce both time and memory complexity while achieving a favorable trade-off between computational efficiency and localization accuracy.

Motivation: 现有的扩散和流式策略在每个控制步骤使用固定的推理预算，导致简单子任务计算效率低下，而困难任务可能性能不足。

Method: 基于随机插值框架，使用难度分类器动态选择步数预算、求解器变体和ODE/SDE积分方法。

Conclusion: DA-SIP将生成式机器人控制器转变为高效、任务感知的系统，智能分配推理资源以获得最大效益。

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based policies deliver state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon robotic manipulation and imitation learning tasks. However, these controllers employ a fixed inference budget at every control step, regardless of task complexity, leading to computational inefficiency for simple subtasks while potentially underperforming on challenging ones. To address these issues, we introduce Difficulty-Aware Stochastic Interpolant Policy (DA-SIP), a framework that enables robotic controllers to adaptively adjust their integration horizon in real time based on task difficulty. Our approach employs a difficulty classifier that analyzes observations to dynamically select the step budget, the optimal solver variant, and ODE/SDE integration at each control cycle. DA-SIP builds upon the stochastic interpolant formulation to provide a unified framework that unlocks diverse training and inference configurations for diffusion- and flow-based policies. Through comprehensive benchmarks across diverse manipulation tasks, DA-SIP achieves 2.6-4.4x reduction in total computation time while maintaining task success rates comparable to fixed maximum-computation baselines. By implementing adaptive computation within this framework, DA-SIP transforms generative robot controllers into efficient, task-aware systems that intelligently allocate inference resources where they provide the greatest benefit.

Conclusion: AerialMind基准填补了无人机场景中Referring Multi-Object Tracking的研究空白，COALA框架显著降低了标注成本，HETrack方法在无人机场景感知方面表现出色。

Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to achieve precise object detection and tracking through natural language instructions, representing a fundamental capability for intelligent robotic systems. However, current RMOT research remains mostly confined to ground-level scenarios, which constrains their ability to capture broad-scale scene contexts and perform comprehensive tracking and path planning. In contrast, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) leverage their expansive aerial perspectives and superior maneuverability to enable wide-area surveillance. Moreover, UAVs have emerged as critical platforms for Embodied Intelligence, which has given rise to an unprecedented demand for intelligent aerial systems capable of natural language interaction. To this end, we introduce AerialMind, the first large-scale RMOT benchmark in UAV scenarios, which aims to bridge this research gap. To facilitate its construction, we develop an innovative semi-automated collaborative agent-based labeling assistant (COALA) framework that significantly reduces labor costs while maintaining annotation quality. Furthermore, we propose HawkEyeTrack (HETrack), a novel method that collaboratively enhances vision-language representation learning and improves the perception of UAV scenarios. Comprehensive experiments validated the challenging nature of our dataset and the effectiveness of our method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIO方法面临效率与精度的权衡：基于滤波的方法效率高但易漂移，基于优化的方法精度高但计算负担重。本文旨在减少视觉惯性束调整的调用频率和强度。

Method: 将VIO中的两个关键设计选择（何时运行视觉前端、如何信任其输出）建模为序列决策问题，使用轻量级RL代理解决。包含选择代理（基于IMU数据智能门控VO流水线）和融合代理（通过监督网络估计速度状态，RL策略自适应融合完整状态）。

Result: 在EuRoC MAV和TUM-VI数据集上的实验表明，该方法在精度-效率-内存权衡方面优于现有GPU-based VO/VIO系统：获得最佳平均ATE，运行速度提升1.77倍，GPU内存使用更少。

Conclusion: 相比传统优化基VIO系统，该方法在保持竞争性轨迹精度的同时显著降低计算负载，实现了更好的精度-效率平衡。

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) is a critical component for robust ego-motion estimation, enabling foundational capabilities such as autonomous navigation in robotics and real-time 6-DoF tracking for augmented reality. Existing methods face a well-known trade-off: filter-based approaches are efficient but prone to drift, while optimization-based methods, though accurate, rely on computationally prohibitive Visual-Inertial Bundle Adjustment (VIBA) that is difficult to run on resource-constrained platforms. Rather than removing VIBA altogether, we aim to reduce how often and how heavily it must be invoked. To this end, we cast two key design choices in modern VIO, when to run the visual frontend and how strongly to trust its output, as sequential decision problems, and solve them with lightweight reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Our framework introduces a lightweight, dual-pronged RL policy that serves as our core contribution: (1) a Select Agent intelligently gates the entire VO pipeline based only on high-frequency IMU data; and (2) a composite Fusion Agent that first estimates a robust velocity state via a supervised network, before an RL policy adaptively fuses the full (p, v, q) state. Experiments on the EuRoC MAV and TUM-VI datasets show that, in our unified evaluation, the proposed method achieves a more favorable accuracy-efficiency-memory trade-off than prior GPU-based VO/VIO systems: it attains the best average ATE while running up to 1.77 times faster and using less GPU memory. Compared to classical optimization-based VIO systems, our approach maintains competitive trajectory accuracy while substantially reducing computational load.

Conclusion: SocialNav通过分层架构和大规模数据集，成功实现了社会感知导航，在导航性能和社会合规性方面都取得了显著进步。

Abstract: Embodied navigation that adheres to social norms remains an open research challenge. Our \textbf{SocialNav} is a foundational model for socially-aware navigation with a hierarchical "brain-action" architecture, capable of understanding high-level social norms and generating low-level, socially compliant trajectories. To enable such dual capabilities, we construct the SocNav Dataset, a large-scale collection of 7 million samples, comprising (1) a Cognitive Activation Dataset providing social reasoning signals such as chain-of-thought explanations and social traversability prediction, and (2) an Expert Trajectories Pyramid aggregating diverse navigation demonstrations from internet videos, simulated environments, and real-world robots. A multi-stage training pipeline is proposed to gradually inject and refine navigation intelligence: we first inject general navigation skills and social norms understanding into the model via imitation learning, and then refine such skills through a deliberately designed Socially-Aware Flow Exploration GRPO (SAFE-GRPO), the first flow-based reinforcement learning framework for embodied navigation that explicitly rewards socially compliant behaviors. SocialNav achieves +38% success rate and +46% social compliance rate compared to the state-of-the-art method, demonstrating strong gains in both navigation performance and social compliance.

Abstract: Non-contact manipulation has emerged as a transformative approach across various industrial fields. However, current flexible 2D and 3D non-contact manipulation techniques are often limited to microscopic scales, typically controlling objects in the milligram range. In this paper, we present a magnetic levitation system, termed Maglev-Pentabot, designed to address this limitation. The Maglev-Pentabot leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to develop complex control strategies for manipulating objects in the gram range. Specifically, we propose an electromagnet arrangement optimized through numerical analysis to maximize controllable space. Additionally, an action remapping method is introduced to address sample sparsity issues caused by the strong nonlinearity in magnetic field intensity, hence allowing the DRL controller to converge. Experimental results demonstrate flexible manipulation capabilities, and notably, our system can generalize to transport tasks it has not been explicitly trained for. Furthermore, our approach can be scaled to manipulate heavier objects using larger electromagnets, offering a reference framework for industrial-scale robotic applications.

We also provide an extensive and diverse 3D asset library with a total of 1100+ supermarket goods and parameterized facilities assets. Building on this generative foundation, we propose a novel benchmark for assessing supermarket agents, featuring two daily tasks in a supermarket: (1) Checkout Unloading: long-horizon tabletop tasks for cashier agents, and (2) In-Aisle Item Collection: complex mobile manipulation tasks for salesperson agents. We validate our platform and benchmark through extensive experiments, including the deployment of a modular agent system and successful sim-to-real transfer. MarketGen provides a comprehensive framework to accelerate research in embodied AI for complex commercial applications.

Abstract: Humanoid robots, with their human-like morphology, hold great potential for industrial applications. However, existing loco-manipulation methods primarily focus on dexterous manipulation, falling short of the combined requirements for dexterity and proactive force interaction in high-load industrial scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework with a decoupled three-stage training pipeline, consisting of an upper-body policy, a lower-body policy, and a delta-command policy. To accelerate upper-body training, a heuristic reward function is designed. By implicitly embedding forward kinematics priors, it enables the policy to converge faster and achieve superior performance. For the lower body, a force-based curriculum learning strategy is developed, enabling the robot to actively exert and regulate interaction forces with the environment.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出双预积分方法，通过整合两个平台的IMU预积分作为运动学约束，解决相对状态估计中非线性旋转导致的线性化误差问题，在VR控制器跟踪中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相对状态估计在六自由度运动中，参考平台的非线性旋转会显著影响估计精度，特别是在大距离情况下。线性化误差会导致估计漂移和不一致性，这在VR应用中表现为控制器跟踪的位置误差。

Method: 提出双预积分方法，将两个平台的IMU预积分整合为新的观测约束，为连续相对状态提供运动学约束，并支持高效重线性化。同时进行状态可观测性分析并解析制定相应的零空间。

Result: 通过仿真和真实实验验证，在参考平台的多重非线性旋转场景下，所提方法相比现有SOTA算法具有更高的精度和鲁棒性。现场测试在VR控制器跟踪应用中，在偏置可观测性、非线性旋转和背景纹理方面均表现更优。

Conclusion: 双预积分方法能有效缓解相对状态估计中的线性化误差问题，在VR控制器跟踪等应用中比现有SOTA算法更精确和鲁棒。

Abstract: Relative State Estimation perform mutually localization between two mobile agents undergoing six-degree-of-freedom motion. Based on the principle of circular motion, the estimation accuracy is sensitive to nonlinear rotations of the reference platform, particularly under large inter-platform distances. This phenomenon is even obvious for linearized kinematics, because cumulative linearization errors significantly degrade precision. In virtual reality (VR) applications, this manifests as substantial positional errors in 6-DoF controller tracking during rapid rotations of the head-mounted display. The linearization errors introduce drift in the estimate and render the estimator inconsistent. In the field of odometry, IMU preintegration is proposed as a kinematic observation to enable efficient relinearization, thus mitigate linearized error. Building on this theory, we propose dual preintegration, a novel observation integrating IMU preintegration from both platforms. This method serves as kinematic constraints for consecutive relative state and supports efficient relinearization. We also perform observability analysis of the state and analytically formulate the accordingly null space. Algorithm evaluation encompasses both simulations and real-world experiments. Multiple nonlinear rotations on the reference platform are simulated to compare the precision of the proposed method with that of other state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. The field test compares the proposed method and SOTA algorithms in the application of VR controller tracking from the perspectives of bias observability, nonlinear rotation, and background texture. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is more precise and robust than the SOTA algorithms.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to align and place a fabric piece on top of another using a dual-arm manipulator and a grayscale camera, so that their surface textures are accurately matched. We propose a novel control scheme that combines Transformer-driven visual servoing with dualarm impedance control. This approach enables the system to simultaneously control the pose of the fabric piece and place it onto the underlying one while applying tension to keep the fabric piece flat. Our transformer-based network incorporates pretrained backbones and a newly introduced Difference Extraction Attention Module (DEAM), which significantly enhances pose difference prediction accuracy. Trained entirely on synthetic images generated using rendering software, the network enables zero-shot deployment in real-world scenarios without requiring prior training on specific fabric textures. Real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed system accurately aligns fabric pieces with different textures.

Abstract: In recent years, dual-arm manipulation has become an area of strong interest in robotics, with end-to-end learning emerging as the predominant strategy for solving bimanual tasks. A critical limitation of such learning-based approaches, however, is their difficulty in generalizing to novel scenarios, especially within cluttered environments. This paper presents an alternative paradigm: a sampling-based optimization framework that utilizes a GPU-accelerated physics simulator as its world model. We demonstrate that this approach can solve complex bimanual manipulation tasks in the presence of static obstacles. Our contribution is a customized Model Predictive Path Integral Control (MPPI) algorithm, \textbf{guided by carefully designed task-specific cost functions,} that uses GPU-accelerated MuJoCo for efficiently evaluating robot-object interaction. We apply this method to solve significantly more challenging versions of tasks from the PerAct$^{2}$ benchmark, such as requiring the point-to-point transfer of a ball through an obstacle course. Furthermore, we establish that our method achieves real-time performance on commodity GPUs and facilitates successful sim-to-real transfer by leveraging unique features within MuJoCo. The paper concludes with a statistical analysis of the sample complexity and robustness, quantifying the performance of our approach.

Abstract: This paper introduces a neural Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) framework for mapless, collision-free navigation in unknown environments with Aerial Robots, using onboard range sensing. We leverage deep neural networks to encode a single range image, capturing all the available information about the environment, into a Signed Distance Function (SDF). The proposed neural architecture consists of two cascaded networks: a convolutional encoder that compresses the input image into a low-dimensional latent vector, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron that approximates the corresponding spatial SDF. This latter network parametrizes an explicit position constraint used for collision avoidance, which is embedded in a velocity-tracking NMPC that outputs thrust and attitude commands to the robot. First, a theoretical analysis of the contributed NMPC is conducted, verifying recursive feasibility and stability properties under fixed observations. Subsequently, we evaluate the open-loop performance of the learning-based components as well as the closed-loop performance of the controller in simulations and experiments. The simulation study includes an ablation study, comparisons with two state-of-the-art local navigation methods, and an assessment of the resilience to drifting odometry. The real-world experiments are conducted in forest environments, demonstrating that the neural NMPC effectively performs collision avoidance in cluttered settings against an adversarial reference velocity input and drifting position estimates.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a unified framework for robotic manipulation by integrating visual perception, language understanding, and control generation. Yet existing VLA models still struggle to generalize across diverse tasks, scenes, and camera viewpoints, and often produce coarse or unstable actions. We introduce E0, a continuized discrete diffusion framework that formulates action generation as iterative denoising over quantized action tokens. Compared with continuous diffusion policies, E0 offers two key advantages: (1) discrete action tokens align naturally with the symbolic structure of pretrained VLM/VLA backbones, enabling stronger semantic conditioning; and 2. discrete diffusion matches the true quantized nature of real-world robot control-whose hardware constraints (e.g., encoder resolution, control frequency, actuation latency) inherently discretize continuous signals-and therefore benefits from a Bayes-optimal denoiser that models the correct discrete action distribution, leading to stronger generalization. Compared with discrete autoregressive and mask-based discrete diffusion models, E0 supports a significantly larger and finer-grained action vocabulary and avoids the distributional mismatch introduced by masking-based corruptions-yielding more accurate fine-grained action control. We further introduce a spherical viewpoint perturbation augmentation method to improve robustness to camera shifts without additional data. Experiments on LIBERO, VLABench, and ManiSkill show that E0 achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 diverse environments, outperforming strong baselines by 10.7% on average. Real-world evaluation on a Franka arm confirms that E0 delivers precise, robust, and transferable manipulation, establishing discrete diffusion as a promising direction for generalizable VLA policy learning.

Abstract: Vision Language Action models have significantly advanced general purpose robotic manipulation by harnessing large scale pretrained vision and language representations. Among existing approaches, a majority of current VLA systems employ parallel two finger grippers as their default end effectors. However, such grippers face inherent limitations in handling certain real world tasks such as wiping glass surfaces or opening drawers without handles due to insufficient contact area or lack of adhesion. To overcome these challenges, we present a low cost, integrated hardware design that combines a mechanical two finger gripper with a vacuum suction unit, enabling dual mode manipulation within a single end effector. Our system supports flexible switching or synergistic use of both modalities, expanding the range of feasible tasks. We validate the efficiency and practicality of our design within two state of the art VLA frameworks: DexVLA and Pi0. Experimental results demonstrate that with the proposed hybrid end effector, robots can successfully perform multiple complex tasks that are infeasible for conventional two finger grippers alone. All hardware designs and controlling systems will be released.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving models have demonstrated strong performance in open-loop evaluations but often suffer from cascading errors and poor generalization in closed-loop settings. To address this gap, we propose Model-based Policy Adaptation (MPA), a general framework that enhances the robustness and safety of pretrained E2E driving agents during deployment. MPA first generates diverse counterfactual trajectories using a geometry-consistent simulation engine, exposing the agent to scenarios beyond the original dataset. Based on this generated data, MPA trains a diffusion-based policy adapter to refine the base policy's predictions and a multi-step Q value model to evaluate long-term outcomes. At inference time, the adapter proposes multiple trajectory candidates, and the Q value model selects the one with the highest expected utility. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark using a photorealistic closed-loop simulator demonstrate that MPA significantly improves performance across in-domain, out-of-domain, and safety-critical scenarios. We further investigate how the scale of counterfactual data and inference-time guidance strategies affect overall effectiveness.

Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty of an object's pose estimate is essential for robust control and planning. Although pose estimation is a well-studied robotics problem, attaching statistically rigorous uncertainty is not well understood without strict distributional assumptions. We develop distribution-free pose uncertainty bounds about a given pose estimate in the monocular setting. Our pose uncertainty only requires high probability noise bounds on pixel detections of 2D semantic keypoints on a known object. This noise model induces an implicit, non-convex set of pose uncertainty constraints. Our key contribution is SLUE (S-Lemma Uncertainty Estimation), a convex program to reduce this set to a single ellipsoidal uncertainty bound that is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. SLUE solves a relaxation of the minimum volume bounding ellipsoid problem inspired by the celebrated S-lemma. It requires no initial guess of the bound's shape or size and is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. For tighter uncertainty bounds at the same confidence, we extend SLUE to a sum-of-squares relaxation hierarchy which is guaranteed to converge to the minimum volume ellipsoidal uncertainty bound for a given set of keypoint constraints. We show this pose uncertainty bound can easily be projected to independent translation and axis-angle orientation bounds. We evaluate SLUE on two pose estimation datasets and a real-world drone tracking scenario. Compared to prior work, SLUE generates substantially smaller translation bounds and competitive orientation bounds. We release code at https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/PoseUncertaintySets.

Abstract: Learning new robot tasks on new platforms and in new scenes from only a handful of demonstrations remains challenging. While videos of other embodiments - humans and different robots - are abundant, differences in embodiment, camera, and environment hinder their direct use. We address the small-data problem by introducing a unifying, symbolic representation - a compact 3D "trace-space" of scene-level trajectories - that enables learning from cross-embodiment, cross-environment, and cross-task videos. We present TraceGen, a world model that predicts future motion in trace-space rather than pixel space, abstracting away appearance while retaining the geometric structure needed for manipulation. To train TraceGen at scale, we develop TraceForge, a data pipeline that transforms heterogeneous human and robot videos into consistent 3D traces, yielding a corpus of 123K videos and 1.8M observation-trace-language triplets. Pretraining on this corpus produces a transferable 3D motion prior that adapts efficiently: with just five target robot videos, TraceGen attains 80% success across four tasks while offering 50-600x faster inference than state-of-the-art video-based world models. In the more challenging case where only five uncalibrated human demonstration videos captured on a handheld phone are available, it still reaches 67.5% success on a real robot, highlighting TraceGen's ability to adapt across embodiments without relying on object detectors or heavy pixel-space generation.
