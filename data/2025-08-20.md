### [1] [YOLO11-CR: a Lightweight Convolution-and-Attention Framework for Accurate Fatigue Driving Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13205)
*Zhebin Jin,Ligang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出YOLO11-CR轻量级目标检测模型，用于实时疲劳检测，通过CAFM和RCM模块提升特征表达和空间定位能力，在DSM数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有疲劳检测方法存在侵入性、硬件依赖或对小目标检测效果差的问题，需要开发非侵入式、鲁棒性强的实时检测方案。

Method: 提出YOLO11-CR模型，包含卷积与注意力融合模块(CAFM)整合CNN局部特征和Transformer全局上下文，以及矩形校准模块(RCM)捕获水平和垂直上下文信息。

Result: 在DSM数据集上达到87.17%精度、83.86%召回率、88.09% mAP@50和55.93% mAP@50-95，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR为车载疲劳监控提供了实用高效解决方案，具有实际部署潜力，未来可扩展时序建模和多模态数据集成。

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Mirage基准和Mirage-R1模型来解决真实世界中AI生成图像检测的挑战，相比现有方法在多个基准上提升5-10%性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI生成图像检测器在实验室干净环境下有效，但无法泛化到真实世界的嘈杂场景，这些图像质量参差不齐且经过多种编辑处理

Method: 构建Mirage基准（包含互联网采集和合成数据），提出Mirage-R1视觉语言模型，采用启发式到分析式推理机制，通过两阶段训练（监督微调+强化学习）和推理时自适应思考策略

Result: 在Mirage基准和公共基准上分别领先现有最佳检测器5%和10%

Conclusion: Mirage基准和Mirage-R1模型有效解决了真实世界AI生成图像检测的泛化问题，在性能和推理速度之间取得了良好平衡

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

### [3] [DianJin-OCR-R1: Enhancing OCR Capabilities via a Reasoning-and-Tool Interleaved Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13238)
*Qian Chen,Xianyin Zhang,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DianJin-OCR-R1是一个推理增强的视觉语言模型框架，通过结合自身OCR能力和专家模型工具来减少幻觉，在OCR任务中表现优于非推理模型和专家模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在文档图像解析中存在幻觉问题（生成图像中不存在的文字），且在OCR任务上不如专门训练的专家模型有效。需要一种方法来结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出推理-工具交织的VLM框架：模型先自行识别图像内容，然后调用专家模型工具获取参考结果，最后重新审视图像并反思推理过程，提供最终识别结果。

Result: 在ReST和OmniDocBench数据集上的实验表明，DianJin-OCR-R1模型持续优于非推理对应模型和专家OCR模型。

Conclusion: 该推理增强框架有效解决了LVLMs的幻觉问题，通过利用专家模型的优势以较低成本提升了VLM在OCR任务上的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用卷积神经网络的两层级结构实现乌尔都语光学字符识别，通过组件分类方法避免切分错误，组件分类准确率达5230.99%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语作为一种草书体语言，具有复杂的几何和形态结构，传统的基于切分的识别方法错误玈较高

Method: 采用卷积神经网络自动学习特征，通过三个字符的排列组合生成数据集，使连通组件技术获取细体，并使用两层级程序处理三级字符排列和组件分类

Result: 模型在组件分类任务上达到了23.99%的准确率

Conclusion: 组件基础的卷积神经网络方法能够有效处理乌尔都语的复杂字符识别问题，避免了传统切分方法的高错误玈

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

### [5] [CLoE: Curriculum Learning on Endoscopic Images for Robust MES Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13280)
*Zeynep Ozdemir,Hacer Yalim Keles,Omer Ozgur Tanriover*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLoE是一个课程学习框架，通过图像质量评估标签可靠性并考虑MES评分的顺序性，显著提升了溃疡性结肠炎内镜图像分类的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mayo内镜评分(MES)分类面临观察者间变异导致的标签噪声问题，且标准模型往往忽略评分的顺序性特征，需要开发能够同时处理标签可靠性和顺序结构的分类方法。

Method: 提出CLoE课程学习框架：1)使用轻量级模型基于BBPS标签估计图像质量作为标注置信度代理；2)按从易(干净)到难(噪声)的顺序组织样本；3)结合ResizeMix数据增强提升鲁棒性；4)在CNN和Transformer架构上验证。

Result: 在LIMUC和HyperKvasir数据集上，CLoE consistently优于强监督和自监督基线。ConvNeXt-Tiny在LIMUC上达到82.5%准确率和0.894 QWK，计算成本低。

Conclusion: 难度感知的训练策略在标签不确定性下能有效改进顺序分类，CLoE框架展示了处理医学图像分类中标签噪声和顺序结构的潜力。

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released
at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

### [6] [GaitCrafter: Diffusion Model for Biometric Preserving Gait Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13300)
*Sirshapan Mitra,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaitCrafter是一个基于扩散模型的步态序列生成框架，能够在轮廓域合成真实步态序列，支持多种条件控制，并能生成新身份数据以保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 步态识别面临大规模标注数据稀缺和隐私保护限制的问题，需要一种能够生成多样化、真实步态数据的方法来提升识别性能。

Method: 使用视频扩散模型在步态轮廓数据上从头训练，生成时间一致且保持身份特征的步态序列，支持服装、携带物品、视角等多种条件控制。

Result: 将GaitCrafter生成的合成样本加入步态识别流程能提升性能，特别是在挑战性条件下；通过身份嵌入插值能生成不在原始数据集中的新身份数据。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了扩散模型在高质量、可控且隐私保护的步态数据生成方面的重要进展，为步态识别提供了有效的数据增强解决方案。

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

### [7] [Prune2Drive: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Accelerating Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13305)
*Minhao Xiong,Zichen Wen,Zhuangcheng Gu,Xuyang Liu,Rui Zhang,Hengrui Kang,Jiabing Yang,Junyuan Zhang,Weijia Li,Conghui He,Yafei Wang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prune2Drive是一个用于自动驾驶多视角视觉语言模型的即插即用视觉token剪枝框架，通过多样性感知token选择和视图自适应剪枝控制，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度和减少内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中的视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率多视角图像时会产生大量视觉token，导致计算开销大、推理延迟高和内存消耗大，阻碍了实际部署。

Method: 提出两种核心创新：1）受最远点采样启发的多样性感知token选择机制，优先考虑跨视图的语义和空间覆盖；2）基于视图重要性的自适应剪枝控制器，为每个摄像头学习最优剪枝比例。无需模型重训练或注意力图访问。

Result: 在两个大规模多视角驾驶基准测试中，当仅保留10%视觉token时，预填充阶段实现6.4倍加速，仅消耗13.4%原始FLOPs，性能仅下降3%。

Conclusion: Prune2Drive有效解决了多视角VLM的计算效率问题，为自动驾驶系统的实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH是一个完全可微分的元攻击框架，通过策略性地组合现有的Lp范数攻击方法，生成有效且感知对齐的对抗样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Lp范数约束对抗样本往往与人类感知不一致，且不清楚Lp约束攻击的见解是否能有效提升感知效果。需要一种能够生成感知对齐对抗样本的方法。

Method: 多阶段框架，每阶段聚合多个基础攻击的候选对抗样本，使用学习到的自适应权重，并通过新颖的元损失函数联合最小化误分类损失和感知失真。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上显著优于最先进的感知攻击方法AdvAD，攻击成功率提高20.63%，视觉质量指标(SSIM、LPIPS、FID)均有显著改善。

Conclusion: DAASH能够很好地泛化到未见过的防御方法，是评估鲁棒性的实用且强大的基准，无需为每个新防御手工设计自适应攻击。

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

Motivation: 需要一种可重复、定量的方法来评估面部整形外科的美学效果，以支持数据驱动的手术规划、患者咨询和客观效果评估

Method: 构建了最大的筛选后的手术前后面部图像数据集（7,160张照片，1,259名患者），采用自动化关键点检测、几何面部对称性计算、深度学习年龄估计和鼻部形态分析的组合方法

Result: 在美鼻手术子集中，96.2%患者至少在一个鼻部测量指标上显示改善，其中最大改善出现在鼻宽与面宽比例（77.0%）。在更广泛的正面视团体中，71.3%患者在全局面部对称性或感知年龄上显示显著改善

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可重复的定量基准和新颖数据集，为数据驱动的手术规划、患者咨询和客观效果评估提供了支持，同时确认手术后患者身份保持一致性

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

Conclusion: 提示工程可以在不需要深度AI知识的情况下实现小型语言模型在医疗健康应用中的性能显著提升

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high
computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

### [12] [Mitigating Easy Option Bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13428)
*Hao Zhang,Chen Li,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现多选VQA基准中存在Easy-Options Bias问题，VLMs仅凭视觉和选项就能选择正确答案，无需问题。提出了GroundAttack工具包生成难负样本，创建无偏数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现当前多选VQA基准存在严重偏差，VLMs可以通过视觉-选项相似性匹配轻松选择正确答案，无需理解问题，导致评估结果不准确。

Method: 通过接地实验分析偏差原因，开发GroundAttack工具包自动生成视觉上合理的难负选项，应用于NExT-QA和MMStar数据集创建无偏标注。

Result: 在无偏标注上，当前VLMs在(V+O)设置下接近随机准确率，在(V+Q+O)设置下准确率显著下降，提供了更真实的VLM问答能力评估。

Conclusion: 揭示了VQA基准中的系统性偏差问题，提出的GroundAttack方法和无偏数据集为更准确地评估VLMs的真实问答能力提供了解决方案。

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

Conclusion: EDTalk++框架成功解决了面部特征解耦的问题，实现了高质量的可控说话头生成，为多模态输入条件下的面部动画生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to
capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

TL;DR: MINR通过共享中间层来高效编码多张图像，在保持性能的同时减少60%参数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决隐式神经表示(INRs)在处理多张图像时计算和存储效率低下的问题

Method: 分析训练好的INRs层间权重分布，共享相似的中间层，保留输入输出层为图像专用，并添加投影层捕获独特特征

Result: 在图像重建和超分辨率任务中，参数量减少60%的同时保持可比性能，可扩展到处理100张图像，平均PSNR达34dB

Conclusion: MINR方法有效解决了多图像INRs的效率问题，具有很好的扩展性和鲁棒性

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

TL;DR: DHQ是一种针对隐式神经表示(INRs)的分布感知哈达玛量化方案，同时对权重和激活值进行量化，通过哈达玛变换将不同分布统一为钟形分布后应用标准量化器，显著提升硬件效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的INR量化方法主要关注权重量化，缺乏激活值量化，硬件节省有限。为了充分利用量化的硬件优势，需要同时量化权重和激活值。

Method: 提出DHQ方案，利用哈达玛变换将不同层的权重和激活值的不同分布标准化为统一的钟形分布，然后应用标准量化器。

Result: 在多种图像重建任务中，DHQ相比全精度版本减少了32.7%的延迟、40.1%的能耗和最高98.3%的资源使用。

Conclusion: DHQ通过分布感知的哈达玛量化有效解决了INRs中权重和激活值的量化问题，显著提升了硬件效率，优于之前的量化方法。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: FAMNet通过多任务学习和层次注意力机制，有效提取了微表情的全方位特征，为微表情识别领域提供了一种高效的解决方案

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial
information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and
noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for
effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel

noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar

effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive

Conclusion: BDCL框架通过双层解耦和一致性学习有效提升了多视图聚类的性能，增强了特征的簇间区分度和簇内紧密度

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

Motivation: 现有HDR技术忽视了快门速度与ISO的复杂交互作用，且没有考虑动态场景中运动模糊的影响，导致高ISO产生噪声、长快门引发模糊的质量问题

Method: 提出AdaptiveAE方法，使用强化学习优化快门速度和ISO组合选择，集成图像合成流程包括运动模糊和噪声模拟，利用语义信息和曝光直方图

Result: 在多个数据集上达到状态前沿性能，能够根据用户定义的曝光时间预算自适应选择最优ISO和快门速度序列

Conclusion: 该方法能够找到比传统方案更好的曝光调度策略，有效解决了动态场景HDR重建中的噪声和模糊问题

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

*Seungheon Baek,Jinhyuk Yun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过转移学习技术将单打训练的模型应用于双打网球分析，解决了双打比赟数据缺乏和多人踪踪挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双打比赟在国际赛事中更为普遍，但以往研究主要集中在单打。需要充分利用单打数据来开发双打分析方法

Method: 使用ViT-Pose提取关键点，通过ST-GCN对比学习框架进行嵌入，采用自定义多目标踪踪算法提高踪踪稳定性，使用Transformer分类器识别击球动作

Result: 证明了基于姿态的击球识别技术可以扩展到双打网球中，扩大了分析能力

Conclusion: 为双打特定数据集的建立奠定了基础，有助于更好理解这种普遍但研究不足的运动形式

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format
of the fast racket sport.

TL;DR: MR6D是一个专为移动机器人6D姿态估计设计的工业环境数据集，包含92个真实场景和16个独特物体，解决了现有数据集局限于家庭小物体的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计数据集主要关注机器人臂操作的小型家庭物品，无法满足移动机器人在工业环境中面临的远距离感知、大尺寸物体、严重自遮挡和多样化视角等挑战。

Method: 创建包含92个真实工业场景的数据集，涵盖16个独特物体，包含静态和动态交互场景，特别捕捉移动平台特有的远距离视角、多样化物体配置、大尺寸物体和复杂遮挡模式。

Result: 初步实验显示当前6D姿态估计方法在这些工业环境下表现不佳，2D分割成为另一个主要障碍。

Conclusion: MR6D为开发和评估针对移动机器人需求的姿态估计方法奠定了基础，填补了工业环境6D姿态估计数据集的空白。

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

*Yiang Shi,Xiaoyang Guo,Wei Yin,Mingkai Jia,Qian Zhang,Xiaolin Hu,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGQ是一种新的图像分词器范式，通过将2D高斯分布整合到视觉码本量化框架中，显式增强结构建模能力，显著提升了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的量化分词器（如VQ-GAN）主要关注外观特征如纹理和颜色，往往忽视几何结构，因为其基于patch的设计限制了结构化视觉信息的建模能力。

Method: 提出Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ)框架，将图像潜在表示编码为2D高斯分布，直接建模位置、旋转和尺度等结构相关参数，通过增加2D高斯密度来提升重建保真度。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256基准测试中，VGQ达到rFID 1.00的强重建质量，通过增加高斯密度进一步获得rFID 0.556和PSNR 24.93的SOTA性能，大幅超越现有方法。

Conclusion: VGQ通过显式建模几何结构参数，有效解决了传统量化方法在结构化视觉信息建模方面的局限性，在token效率和视觉丰富度之间提供了灵活权衡。

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于几何知识引导的分布校准框架，利用现成的基础模型（如CLIP、DINOv2）提取的特征分布几何形状在不同领域和数据集间具有显著可迁移性的特点，来解决联邦学习和长尾识别中的分布偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习面临的一个主要挑战是观测训练样本与真实分布之间的差距，这种差距可能由采样偏差、噪声等多种原因造成。在基础模型时代，研究者发现现成视觉基础模型提取的特征分布几何形状具有跨域可迁移性，这为解决数据异构性和样本不平衡问题提供了新思路。

Method: 提出了几何知识引导的分布校准框架：1）在联邦学习中，设计技术在隐私约束下获取全局几何形状，并利用该知识为客户端生成新样本以弥合本地与全局观测差距；2）在长尾学习中，利用从样本丰富类别转移的几何知识来恢复样本稀缺尾类的真实分布。

Result: 综合实验表明，所提出的几何知识引导分布校准方法有效克服了由数据异构性和样本不平衡引起的信息缺陷，在多个基准测试中实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: 利用基础模型特征分布的几何形状知识可以有效校准分布偏差，该方法在联邦学习和长尾识别等具有挑战性的场景中展现出良好的实用价值，为解决深度学习中的分布差距问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

Motivation: 面部情感识别在人机交互和心理健康诊断中具有重要应用价值，但现有视觉-语言模型在低质量图像任务上的表现仍未经过系统性评估。

Method: 使用FER-2013数据集（包含35,887张低分辨率灰度图片），对比Phi-3.5 Vision、CLIP等VLMs与VGG19、ResNet-50、EfficientNet-B0等传统模型。提出集成GFPGAN图像恢复的新流水线来处理噪声数据。

Result: 传统模型显著替代VLMs：EfficientNet-B0达到86.44%准确率，ResNet-50为85.72%，而CLIP和Phi-3.5 Vision分别只有64.07%和51.66%。还提供了计算成本分析。

Conclusion: 视觉-语言模型在低质量视觉任务中存在显著局限性，需要适应噪声环境。该研究为情感识别领域提供了可复现的基准测试。

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as
human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents
the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models
VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,
which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion
classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy
nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based
image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models,
particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a
detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training,
inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment.
This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and
provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3DGS基于头部虚拟人方法在捕捉细粒度面部表情和保持局部纹理连续性方面面临挑战，特别是在高可变形区域

Method: 提出EAvatar框架，采用稀疏表情控制机制，用少量关键高斯影响周围高斯的变形，并利用预训练生成模型的高质量3D先验知识提供面部几何结构指导

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能够产生更准确、视觉一致的头部重建结果，在表情可控性和细节保真度方面都有显著提升

Conclusion: EAvatar框架通过表惉感知和变形感知的设计，有效解决了3DGS基于头部虚拟人重建中的细粒度表惉捕捉和局部纹理连续性问题

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

TL;DR: FLAIR提出了一种频率和局部性感知的隐式神经表示方法，通过RC-GAUSS激活函数和WEGE编码机制解决现有INRs缺乏频率选择性和空间局部性的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式神经表示缺乏频率选择性、空间局部性和稀疏表示，导致过度依赖冗余信号分量，表现出频谱偏差，难以捕捉高频细节

Method: 提出FLAIR方法，包含两个关键创新：1) RC-GAUSS激活函数，在时频不确定性原理约束下实现显式频率选择和空间定位；2) 小波能量引导编码(WEGE)，利用离散小波变换计算能量分数并显式引导频率信息

Result: 在2D图像表示和恢复以及3D重建任务中，该方法持续优于现有隐式神经表示方法

Conclusion: FLAIR通过引入频率选择和空间定位机制，有效解决了隐式神经表示的频谱偏差问题，提升了高频细节的捕捉能力

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: 纯软件注视预测可用于VR注视点渲染，使性能提升更易于在不同VR平台和应用中部署，无需额外硬件要求

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

Motivation: 生成式人脸视频编码（GFVC）虽然有优异的码率-失真性能，但大型模型参数和高计算成本阻碍了其实际部署。

Method: 提出双模式优化方法：1）结构重设-用更薄轻高效的层替换传统3x3卷积；2）两阶段适应性通道剪枝-训练时软剪枝通过可学习阈值识别冗余通道，训练后硬剪枝用导出的掩码永久删除。

Conclusion: 该轻量化方法有望在资源受限环境（如移动边缘设备）中实现高效的GFVC部署。

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

Conclusion: 这种受生物启发的方法有望突破神经模态计算的当前限制，促进SNN的更广泛应用。

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在少样本异常分割中的跨类别泛化能力严重依赖已见异常样本的先验知识，需要寻找无需重新训练即可检测未见类别异常的新方法。

Method: 包含三个核心组件：字典构建（用正常参考图像特征模拟字典索引和内容）、字典查找（通过稀疏查找策略检索查询区域特征，无法检索的特征被分类为异常）、查询判别正则化（通过对比查询约束和文本对齐约束增强异常判别能力）。

Result: 在七个公共工业和医疗数据集上的广泛实验表明，DictAS持续优于最先进的少样本异常分割方法。

Conclusion: DictAS通过自监督字典查找机制成功实现了对未见类别的异常检测，避免了传统方法对已见异常样本的依赖，展现了优异的泛化性能。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

Conclusion: 该方法成为了一个实用简洁的基准方法，在保持准确性的同时大幅提升计算效率，为3D人体姿势和形状估计领域提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出一种新的生成式注意力模型，通过同时学习帧级和段级依赖关系来提升视频动作分析的准确性，适用于自动驾驶等高性能IoT应用场景


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频动作分析方法忽视了特征语义的重要性，过于关注动作建议优化，导致在高性能IoT应用中的准确度不足

Method: 使用生成式注意力模型学习特征语义关系，利用动作前景和背景的差异同时学习时间帧级和段级依赖关系

Result: 在动作检测和动作识别任务上进行了涉及广泛数据集的完整验证，证明了方法的优劢性

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效利用特征语义，提供了一种适用于高性能IoT应用的稳健且可扩展的视频分析方案

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Generative-Feature-Model/GAF.

TL;DR: 通过创新的时序条件化分割头设计和文本到视频渗透模型特征提取，提出了一种新的指代视频对象分割方法，在四个公开数据集上实现了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现现有RVOS方法过于关注特征提取和时序模型，而对分割头设计的重视不够，分割头设计仍有很大改进空间。

Method: 提出时序条件化指代视频对象分割模型，集成现有分割方法提升边界分割能力；删除传统噪声预测模块避免随机性影响；设计时序上下文掩码精细模块(TCMR)改善特征提取。

Result: 在四个公开RVOS测试集上均达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 通过重新关注分割头设计和创新的模块构造，可以在不增加复杂性的情况下显著提升指代视频对象分割的质量。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在恶劣天气条件下性能显著下降，而现有数据集缺乏恶劣条件数据，收集和标注成本过高

Method: 提出域适应流水线，包括模拟、GAN和混合扩散-GAN方法，将晴天图像转换为雾、雨、雪和夜间图像，采用新训练方法结合模拟和真实图像，并通过混合技术减少扩散模型的幻觉效应

Result: 在ACDC数据集上评测，语义分割整体提升1.85%，夜间场景提升4.62%

Conclusion: 混合方法能够有效提升自动驾驶系统在挑战性条件下的感知稳健性

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

Motivation: 状态空间模型在计算机视觉中表现出强大能力，但计算效率仍需提升。现有的token缩减方法需要针对SSM的序列建模特性进行专门设计。

Method: 提出MaMe策略：1) 使用状态转移参数Δ作为信息重要性度量；2) 引入战略性token排列以保持序列信息流；3) 适用于微调和现成模型。

Result: 在图像分类任务中实现了优越的效率-性能权衡，即使在激进的token缩减下仍保持鲁棒性。在视频和音频领域也展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MaMe为SSM模型提供了一种有效的效率提升方法，在多个视觉和序列任务中均表现出色，为SSM的实际部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

<details>

Motivation: 解决现有方法中语义和几何信息处理相互冲突的问题，避免性能折衷

Method: 采用双重解耦设计：源级别提供语义特征和立体成本体积，途径级别通过专门化途径精炼处理，使用混合视图变换和轴向感知融合模块

Result: 在SemanticKITTI上较之前最佳方法提升+0.23 mIoU和+2.03 IoU，在SSCBench-KITTI-360上达到21.78 mIoU和48.61 IoU的独创性能

Conclusion: 双重解耦设计能够有效分离和优化语义与几何信息处理，显著提升3D语义场景完成的性能

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型在图像旋转识别任务上表现不佳，特别是无法可靠区分90度和270度旋转，显示出空间推理能力与人类感知存在显著差距


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态大语言模型识别图像旋转方向的能力，评估其在空间推理和视觉理解方面的表现

Method: 构建RotBench基准测试集（350张图像），测试多种先进MLLM模型，使用辅助信息（标题、深度图等）和思维链提示等技术进行改进尝试

Result: 大多数模型能识别0度（正立）图像，部分能识别180度（倒立）图像，但都无法可靠区分90度和270度旋转。辅助信息和思维链提示只有微小且不一致的改进

Conclusion: MLLM在图像旋转识别任务上存在显著局限性，特别是在区分90度和270度旋转方面，表明其空间推理能力仍有待提升

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and
high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated
multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized
Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a
given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great
potential for generating automated Vlogs.

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in
smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local
Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified
LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

Motivation: 当前最先进的音频驱动说话头合成模型在人类多样性（种族、语言、年龄群体）方面缺乏泛化能力，这主要是由于训练数据在规模、质量和多样性方面的局限性。

Method: 通过多阶段自动化流水线精心筛选运动稳定性、美学质量和面部细节，构建了TalkVid数据集，并创建了TalkVid-Bench分层评估集（500个片段），在关键人口统计和语言维度上进行平衡。

Conclusion: TalkVid数据集和TalkVid-Bench评估基准为解决音频驱动说话头合成中的多样性泛化问题提供了重要资源，强调了在研究中考虑人口统计平衡评估的必要性。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

Conclusion: 该方法为使用RGB图像推进类别级物体始位估计提供了新的视角，能够在真实场景中进行准确的始位估计而无需深度数据

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

Conclusion: DiffIER方法有效解决了扩散模型的训练-推理差距问题，具有广泛的适用性和应用潜力，为未来研究提供了有价值的优化框架。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at

Conclusion: DeH4R通过混合设计成功结合了图生成方法的高效性和图增长方法的动态性，在保持快速推理的同时显著提升了拓扑保真性和空间一致性

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/7777777FAN/DeH4R.

Motivation: 随着多模态模型的快速发展，追求人工通用智能需要模型在多样化环境中达到人类可比的性能，特别是在人类相关的视觉上下文理解方面

Method: 提出HumanPCR评估套件，包含三个层次：Human-P（感知）、Human-C（理解）和Human-R（推理）。前两个层次包含6000+人工验证的多选题，评估9个维度的任务；Human-R提供手动策划的视频推理测试，需要整合多个视觉证据和主动提取上下文

Result: 对30多个最先进模型的广泛评估显示，在人类中心视觉理解方面存在显著挑战，特别是在详细空间感知、时间理解和心智建模任务中。模型在从多样化人类场景中提取主动视觉证据方面表现挣扎，过度依赖查询引导检索

Conclusion: 即使采用先进的视觉上下文扩展和测试时思考技术，收益也有限。HumanPCR和发现将推动多模态模型的开发、评估和人类中心应用

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DCMamba框架，通过数据、网络和特征三个层面的多样性增强，实现半监督医学图像分割的先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注成本高昂，半监督分割技术可以缓解这一问题。Mamba等状态空间模型在处理长距离依赖方面表现出色，值得在半监督医学图像分割中探索应用

Method: Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba框架：1）数据层面：基于Mamba扫描特性的patch级弱-强混合增强；2）网络层面：多样化扫描协作模块，利用不同扫描方向的预测差异；3）特征层面：不确定性加权的对比学习机制增强特征表示多样性

Result: 在Synapse数据集上，使用20%标注数据时，比最新的SSM-based方法提升6.69%

Conclusion: DCMamba框架通过多角度多样性增强，在半监督医学图像分割任务中取得了显著优于现有方法的性能，证明了Mamba模型在该领域的应用潜力

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

Conclusion: 该研究为农业Metaverse内容检索提供了有效的解决方案，并通过大规模数据集和高效模型提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%
MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and

*Yiming Cao,Yanjie Li,Kaisheng Liang,Yuni Lai,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出IPGA攻击方法，通过利用投影器模块的中间阶段（Q-Former）进行更精细的对抗攻击，在保持无关视觉内容的同时实现更精确的视觉语义操控


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法在视觉语言模型中存在局限性：1）将丰富视觉语义压缩为单一全局向量，限制了攻击粒度；2）忽略了投影器模块这一关键语义桥梁，未能破坏完整的视觉-语言对齐流程

Method: IPGA方法：1）首次利用投影器模块中间阶段（Q-Former）进行攻击；2）使用仅在视觉-语言对齐第一阶段预训练的Q-Former；3）提出残差查询对齐（RQA）技术来保持无关视觉内容

Result: 实验表明IPGA在全局图像描述和细粒度视觉问答任务中均优于现有方法，在黑盒环境下具有更好的攻击效果和可迁移性，成功迁移到多个商业VLM（Google Gemini、OpenAI GPT）

Conclusion: IPGA通过利用投影器中间阶段实现了更精细和有效的对抗攻击，为VLM安全性评估提供了新思路

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种无需训练的解码策略，通过顺序掩码图像来缓解多图像输入时的信息泄漏问题，显著提升多图像推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理多图像输入时性能显著下降，因为不同图像的视觉线索在模型输出中相互干扰，出现跨图像信息泄漏现象

Method: 提出FOCUS解码策略：顺序用随机噪声掩码所有图像只保留一张清晰图像，引导模型专注于单张图像；重复此过程获得部分掩码上下文下的logits，然后聚合并通过噪声参考输入进行对比精炼

Result: FOCUS在四个多图像基准测试和多种LVLM模型家族中一致提升性能

Conclusion: FOCUS提供了一种通用且实用的解决方案，无需额外训练或架构修改即可增强多图像推理能力

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的多相机设备下的3D形状向二维关键点的非粘性注册方法，通过普遍相机模型和凸规划等技术，实现了更高精度的变形形状重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将单影像的Shape-from-Template(SfT)技术扩展到多相机系统，利用多视图之间的相互约束来提高变形形状注册的准确性，以满足医学成像等领域的需求。

Method: 提出三种方法：1)知道空间中3D点的方向向量法；2)未知但有定向的方向向量法；3)结合边缘信息的迭代精化方法。使用普遍相机模型和凸规划技术来解决注册问题。

Result: 在合成和实际数据上验证了方法的准确性，显示出多相机系统能够显著提高变形形状重建的精度。

Conclusion: 这是首批解决普遍相机下SfT问题的方法，为多相机变形形状注册领域开启了新方向，在医学应用等领域具有重要意义。

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionLaw是一个双层优化框架，通过视觉观察推断可解释的内在动力学表达式，使用LLMs生成和修订本构定律，结合视觉模拟评估一致性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从视觉观察推断物体内在动力学时面临两大挑战：依赖手动定义的本构先验难以泛化到复杂场景，或使用神经网络导致可解释性差和泛化能力有限。

Method: 提出双层优化框架：上层使用LLMs驱动的解耦本构演化策略，LLMs作为物理专家生成和修订本构定律；下层使用视觉引导的本构评估机制，通过视觉模拟评估生成定律与内在动力学的一致性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，VisionLaw能有效从视觉观察推断可解释的内在动力学，显著优于现有最先进方法，在新场景的交互模拟中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: VisionLaw成功解决了现有方法的局限性，通过结合LLMs的物理知识和视觉模拟验证，实现了可解释且泛化能力强的内在动力学推断框架。

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

TL;DR: Med-CTX是一个基于Transformer的多模态乳腺癌超声分割框架，整合临床放射学报告提升性能和可解释性，在BUS-BRA数据集上达到Dice 99%和IoU 95%的优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高乳腺癌超声分割的准确性和可解释性，通过整合临床文本信息来增强模型的可信度和透明度，为计算机辅助诊断提供更可靠的解决方案。

Method: 使用双分支视觉编码器（ViT+Swin Transformer）进行病灶分割，结合BioClinicalBERT编码临床BI-RADS语义文本，通过跨模态注意力融合视觉和文本特征，同时生成分割掩码、不确定性图和诊断依据。

Result: 在BUS-BRA数据集上达到Dice 99%和IoU 95%，超越U-Net、ViT和Swin等基线模型。多模态对齐得分85%（CLIP分数），置信度校准误差3.2%（ECE）。消融研究表明临床文本对性能至关重要。

Conclusion: Med-CTX通过整合临床文本信息显著提升了乳腺癌超声分割的性能和可解释性，为可信赖的多模态医疗架构设立了新标准，在准确性和透明度方面都表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated
explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps,
and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency
in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new
bar for trustworthy, multimodal medical architecture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对脉冲神经网络的时间步压缩攻击(TCA)框架，通过时间步级反向传播和对抗性膜电位重用技术，显著降低了攻击延迟达56%以上，同时保持相似的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于梯度的SNN对抗攻击方法主要依赖FGSM和PGD框架的扩展，存在多时间步处理带来的显著攻击延迟问题，无法满足实际实时应用需求。这些方法作为ANN范式的直接扩展，未能充分利用SNN的关键特性。

Method: 提出了时间步压缩攻击(TCA)框架，包含两个核心组件：1) 时间步级反向传播(TLBP) - 基于发现全局时间信息对攻击成功不关键，支持逐时间步评估和早期停止；2) 对抗性膜电位重用(A-MPR) - 利用初始时间步低效积累膜电位的特点，预计算并重用这个预热阶段。

Result: 在VGG-11和ResNet-17模型上使用CIFAR-10/100和CIFAR10-DVS数据集的实验表明，TCA在白盒和黑盒设置下分别比SOTA方法减少了56.6%和57.1%的攻击延迟，同时保持了可比的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: TCA框架通过利用SNN的独特特性，显著降低了对抗攻击的计算延迟，为SNN在实时应用中的安全部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

Result: 在八个北美城市中准确恢复属级多样性模式，Wasserstein距离低且保持空间自相关性

Conclusion: 该可扩展方法能够支持缺乏详细数据城市的生物多样性制图和直接监测，促进城市生态系统的公平管理

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while
supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across
regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable
access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The

costly in terms of time and resources. The system developed here introduces and
evaluates a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) system, designed to
simulate collaboration between experts and automate the diagnosis of stone

architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this
specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an
environmental expert, a conservator-restorer, and a diagnostic coordinator. To
evaluate the system we selected 28 difficult images involving multiple
deterioration patterns. Our first results showed a huge boost on all metrics of

Motivation: 当前增量学习评估多使用综合的简化基准，徒蔽了现实世界中的性能问题，需要更现实的评测标准来揭示真实的挑战。

Method: 构建了两个现实性增量学习目标检测基准RICO：D-RICO包含域迁移但类别固定，EC-RICO每个IL步骤都添加新域和新类。基于14个多样化数据集，涵盖真实和综合域、多种条件、相机传感器、视角和标注策略。

Result: 实验显示所有IL方法在适应性和知识保持方面都表现不佳，而重放少量历史数据的简单方法已经超过所有现有方法。但单独训练仍然最好。归因于识别教学中的弱老师、单模型无法管理多样任务以及不足的可塑性。

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full

adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: LCRReg是一种新颖的正则化方法，利用潜在概念表示来引导医学影像深度学习模型学习语义基础特征而非虚假相关性，提高分布偏移下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像深度学习模型往往依赖虚假相关性而非临床有意义特征，在分布偏移下泛化能力差，需要一种无需密集概念标注的方法来提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: 使用小型辅助数据集合成高质量解耦概念样本，提取预定义相关特征的潜在概念表示，通过正则化项引导CNN在相关概念子空间内激活。

Result: 在合成和真实医学任务中验证有效：在玩具数据集上显著提升对注入虚假相关性的鲁棒性；在糖尿病视网膜病变分类任务中提升合成扰动和OOD泛化性能。

Conclusion: LCRReg提供了一种轻量级、架构无关的策略，无需密集概念监督即可改善模型鲁棒性，优于多任务学习、线性探测等基线方法。

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

TL;DR: 单元格LSTM模型预测南亚霜霾气泥指数，准5天预测精度较高


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 南亚地区年度霜霾事件严重，缺乏实时区域气质预报系统，需要精准预测气泥污染物浓度

Method: 使用Sentinel-5P卫星数据(2019-2023)和ConvLSTM神经网络，通过累积神经网络捕捉空间和时间相关性

Result: 模型能够预测5天后的气泥指数，平均方差错误~0.0018，损失~0.3995，结构相似性指数~0.74

Conclusion: ConvLSTM模型对南亚霜霾气泥指数预测有效，但需整合更多数据和优化模型结构来提升性能

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

Result: 广泛实验结果显示SCRNet持续达到了最先进的性能，显著超过了现有方法。

Conclusion: SCRNet通过创新地结合卷积和交叉注意力机制，成功地同时捐捕了长程依赖关系和局部上下文信息，为医学超声图像分割领域提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: PhysGM通过联合预测3D表示和物理属性，结合DPO优化策略，成功解决了现有方法的局限性，为单图像到4D物理仿真提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

Motivation: 现实环境中复杂光照条件（如低光和背光）会导致图像质量下降，影响下游视觉任务。现有方法大多只处理单一类型的光照退化，缺乏统一处理多样化光照条件的能力。

Method: 提出混合专家光照估计模块，通过稀疏门控机制自适应选择S曲线专家网络；结合Retinex理论设计损伤修复模块，包含光照感知交叉注意力和序列状态全局注意力机制；构建混合光照数据集MixBL进行训练。

Result: 在合成和真实世界的低光和背光数据集上均取得竞争性性能，无需重新训练即可处理多种光照条件。

Conclusion: DIME-Net展示了在多样化复杂光照条件下的泛化能力和实际多媒体应用潜力。

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

Method: 扩展标准ViT骨干网络，添加可学习的质量token与图像patch token拼接，通过全局自注意力处理，使用双头输出结构分别处理面部表示和质量预测

Result: 在多个挑战性基准测试和不同FR模型上，ViT-FIQA始终达到顶级性能

Conclusion: 基于transformer的架构在建模面部图像效用方面非常有效，ViT有潜力作为未来FIQA研究的可扩展基础

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future
FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new
platform for advancing depth estimation research.

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: The design and analysis of pallet setups are essential for ensuring safety of
packages transportation. With rising demands in the logistics sector, the
development of automated systems utilizing advanced technologies has become

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长距离感知的计算效率问题，为高速公路和重型车辆自动驾驶提供了可行的技术基础

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

Conclusion: 通过适应性视角选择和多视角立体技术，成功实现了高质量的在线3D向量场景重建，有效解决了依赖关键帧导致的重建不完整问题

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

Conclusion: Noisy Alignment通过显式抑制噪声成分有效解决了现有数据投毒后门攻击方法的局限性，为对比学习的安全性研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial

this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame

views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational
constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically
designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the
coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent
space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models.
We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively
enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,
from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while
maintaining efficiency in training.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage
efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个新的素蕴度视频检索数据集Dense-WebVid-CoVR和基于交叉注意力融合的模型，在组合视频检索任务上达到了状态前治性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准检索框架在处理细粒度组合查询和时间理解变化方面的困难，提高细粒度设置下的检索能力。

Method: 构建包含160万样本的素蕴修改文本数据集，开发了一个新模型，通过基于基础文本编码器的交叉注意力融合技术，实现视觉和文本信息的精确对齐。

Result: 在视觉+文本设置下达到了71.3% Recall@1，超过现有最佳方法3.4%，在所有指标上都达到了状态前治性能。

Conclusion: 该研究通过素蕴修改文本数据集和高效的交叉注意力融合模型，显著提升了组合视频检索的精确性和效果。

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained
setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both
fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its
efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense
modification texts. Our proposed dataset, code, and model are available at

Abstract: LongSplat addresses critical challenges in novel view synthesis (NVS) from
casually captured long videos characterized by irregular camera motion, unknown
camera poses, and expansive scenes. Current methods often suffer from pose
drift, inaccurate geometry initialization, and severe memory limitations. To
address these issues, we introduce LongSplat, a robust unposed 3D Gaussian
Splatting framework featuring: (1) Incremental Joint Optimization that
concurrently optimizes camera poses and 3D Gaussians to avoid local minima and
ensure global consistency; (2) a robust Pose Estimation Module leveraging
learned 3D priors; and (3) an efficient Octree Anchor Formation mechanism that
converts dense point clouds into anchors based on spatial density. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that LongSplat achieves
state-of-the-art results, substantially improving rendering quality, pose
accuracy, and computational efficiency compared to prior approaches. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型输出常反映训练数据中的结构性性别不平衡，需要开发更有效的方法来检测和减缓这种偏见。

Method: 基于话语意识公平性分析，提出新的演员层面指标，包括情感不对称性、句法主体性和引用风格。支持诊断性语料分析和排除基于平衡方法。

Result: 在taz2024full德语报纸语料库(1980-2024)中实现了多个语言维度上的显著性别平衡改善，表面层不对称性可通过过滤和重新平衡来减缓。

Conclusion: 虽然表面偏见可以减缓，但更细微的偏见形式(特别是情感和框架方面)仍持续存在，需要更深入的话语公平性审计研究。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly shaping digital communication, yet
their outputs often reflect structural gender imbalances that originate from
their training data. This paper presents an extended actor-level pipeline for
detecting and mitigating gender discrimination in large-scale text corpora.
Building on prior work in discourse-aware fairness analysis, we introduce new
actor-level metrics that capture asymmetries in sentiment, syntactic agency,
and quotation styles. The pipeline supports both diagnostic corpus analysis and
exclusion-based balancing, enabling the construction of fairer corpora. We
apply our approach to the taz2024full corpus of German newspaper articles from
1980 to 2024, demonstrating substantial improvements in gender balance across
multiple linguistic dimensions. Our results show that while surface-level
asymmetries can be mitigated through filtering and rebalancing, subtler forms
of bias persist, particularly in sentiment and framing. We release the tools
and reports to support further research in discourse-based fairness auditing
and equitable corpus construction.

Motivation: 现有基准测试如BrowseComp主要关注文本信息，忽略了网页中普遍存在的多模态内容（图像、视频），需要专门的多模态评估基准。

Method: 创建包含224个挑战性问题的基准测试，问题提示中包含图像，网页中的关键信息也嵌入在图像或视频中，并提供验证清单进行细粒度分析。

Result: 对最先进模型的评估显示，即使是OpenAI o3等顶级模型也仅达到29.02%的准确率，表明当前模型的多模态能力不足且缺乏原生多模态推理能力。

Conclusion: MM-BrowseComp突显了当前AI模型在多模态网页浏览方面的显著不足，为未来多模态推理能力的发展提供了重要的评估基准。

Abstract: AI agents with advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities have demonstrated
impressive performance in web browsing for deep search. While existing
benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily
focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content.
To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising
224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents'
multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often
incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the
search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on
webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for
our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question,
enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths.
Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp
reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\%
accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of
native multimodal reasoning in current models.

Conclusion: 该研究为更准确和高效的实时语音翻译开挖了新路径，通过创新的技术结合有效解决了流式翻译的关键挑战。

Abstract: This paper tackles several challenges that arise when integrating Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) for real-time, on-device
streaming speech translation. Although state-of-the-art ASR systems based on
Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T) can perform real-time
transcription, achieving streaming translation in real-time remains a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous
translation approach that effectively balances translation quality and latency.
We also investigate efficient integration of ASR and MT, leveraging linguistic
cues generated by the ASR system to manage context and utilizing efficient
beam-search pruning techniques such as time-out and forced finalization to
maintain system's real-time factor. We apply our approach to an on-device
bilingual conversational speech translation and demonstrate that our techniques
outperform baselines in terms of latency and quality. Notably, our technique
narrows the quality gap with non-streaming translation systems, paving the way
for more accurate and efficient real-time speech translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用推理模型提升LLM在逻辑步骤任务中的表现，习语检测作为需要理解后才能消歧的语言任务可能受益于这种推理框架

Method: 评估DeepSeek-R1蒸馏模型系列(1.5B-70B参数)在四个习语检测数据集上的表现，分析推理链(CoT)和模型大小的影响，并尝试为小模型提供定义提示

Result: 推理效果较小且多变：小模型CoT推理可从数学调优中间模型提升性能但不及基础模型，大模型(14B/32B/70B)有适度改进；大模型能准确生成习语定义，小模型常失败；为小模型提供定义可在某些情况下改善性能

Conclusion: 模型大小对习语理解能力有显著影响，大模型展现出更好的习语理解能力，而通过精心设计的提示策略可以部分弥补小模型在这方面的不足

Abstract: The recent trend towards utilisation of reasoning models has improved the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across many tasks which involve
logical steps. One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is
idiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be
understood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning.
In this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect
idiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We
evaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1
distillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four
idiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller
and more varied than expected. For smaller models, producing chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning increases performance from Math-tuned intermediate models, but
not to the levels of the base models, whereas larger models (14B, 32B, and 70B)
show modest improvements. Our in-depth analyses reveal that larger models
demonstrate good understanding of idiomaticity, successfully producing accurate
definitions of expressions, while smaller models often fail to output the
actual meaning. For this reason, we also experiment with providing definitions
in the prompts of smaller models, which we show can improve performance in some
cases.

Motivation: ASR系统在长音频转写中常常无法维持语法和语义的准确性，影响命名实体识别、大写化和标点符号等任务

Method: 1）使用最优运输进行标记级利润精炼，对齐维度和序列长度；2）最小化Whisper和LLaMA句子嵌入表示之间的表示损失，混合语法和语义

Result: 在Spoken Wikipedia数据集上评估显示，在词错误率、命名实体识别、大写化和标点符号成功率方面都取得了显著改进

Conclusion: 通过将语言上下文集成到转写中，为长形式语音的健壮、上下文感知ASR系统奠定了基础

Abstract: ASR systems often struggle with maintaining syntactic and semantic accuracy
in long audio transcripts, impacting tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER),
capitalization, and punctuation. We propose a novel approach that enhances ASR
by distilling contextual knowledge from LLaMA models into Whisper. Our method
uses two strategies: (1) token level distillation with optimal transport to
align dimensions and sequence lengths, and (2) representation loss minimization
between sentence embeddings of Whisper and LLaMA, blending syntax and
semantics. Evaluations on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset, a benchmark with long
audios and rich entities demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error
Rate (WER), NER, capitalization, and punctuation success. By introducing novel
NER metrics and exploring semantics aware ASR, our work highlights the value of
integrating linguistic context into transcription, setting a foundation for
robust, context-aware ASR in longform speech.

TL;DR: Datarus-R1-14B是一个14B参数的开源语言模型，基于Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct微调，专门用于虚拟数据分析和研究生级别问题求解，在多项基准测试中超越同规模模型并达到更大模型的水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统LLM在复杂问题求解中存在的格式崩溃、冗长循环和推理质量不稳定等问题，需要开发一个能够产生完整分析轨迹、支持代码执行和自我修正的专业级问题求解模型。

Method: 采用轨迹中心的合成数据生成器产生14.4万个标记的笔记本片段，结合双奖励框架（结构信号+分层奖励模型），使用内存优化的GRPO算法，并设计了双推理接口（代理模式和反思模式）。

Result: 在标准基准测试中超越同规模模型，达到QwQ-32B等更大推理模型的水平，在AIME 2024/2025和LiveCodeBench上准确率提升高达30%，同时每个解决方案减少18-49%的token输出。

Conclusion: Datarus通过轨迹中心训练、双奖励框架和双推理接口的设计，成功解决了RL对齐LLM的常见问题，在复杂问题求解中表现出更高的效率和准确性。

Abstract: We present Datarus-R1-14B, a 14 B-parameter open-weights language model
fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct to act as a virtual data analyst and
graduate-level problem solver. Datarus is trained not on isolated
question-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning
steps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions,
all captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine,
numerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline
combines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000
tagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight
tag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores
both single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a
memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
featuring KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding.
A cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to
semantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague
RL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning
interface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke
Python tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags. On
demanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an "AHA-moment"
pattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges
avoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems.
Across standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and
even reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up
to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting
18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

Method: 采用参数效率微调技术，使用Small-World-of-Words项目的英语-美国和普通话词语联想规范进行监督微调（SFT）和PPO基于偏好优化

Result: SFT在英语中提升预测精度约16-20%，普通话中提升43-165%，达到人类水平的情感价值和激活度，在世界价值观调查中模型回答呈现出目标文化偏吐

Conclusion: 7-8B模型的文化对齐效果可以比较原始70B模型，证明少量文化基础词联想数据即可实现价值对齐，为基于人类认知的AI文化对齐研究提供了新方向

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate cross-cultural
communication, their behavior still reflects the distributional bias of the
languages and viewpoints that are over-represented in their pre-training
corpora. Yet, it remains a challenge to model and align culture due to limited
cultural knowledge and a lack of exploration into effective learning
approaches. We introduce a cost-efficient, cognitively grounded remedy:
parameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' free word-association
norms, which encode implicit cultural schemas. Leveraging English-US and
Mandarin associations from the Small-World-of-Words project, we adapt
Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PPO-based
preference optimization. SFT boosts held-out association Precision at 5 by
16-20% in English and 43-165% in Mandarin, lifts median concreteness by +0.20,
and attains human-level valence and arousal. These lexical gains transfer: on
World-Values-Survey questions, fine-tuned models shift answer distributions
toward the target culture, and on a 50-item high-tension subset, Qwen's
Chinese-aligned responses double while Llama's US bias drops by one-third. Our
7-8B models rival or beat vanilla 70B baselines, showing that a few million
culture-grounded associations can instill value alignment without costly
retraining. Our work highlights both the promise and the need for future
research grounded in human cognition in improving cultural alignment in AI
models.

Motivation: 现有医疗大语言模型主要采用被动回答模式，缺乏主动信息收集能力，在交互式临床咨询中存在误诊风险

Method: 提出基于强化学习的ProMed框架，使用Shapley信息增益(SIG)奖励量化问题临床价值，包含SIG引导模型初始化和SIG增强策略优化两阶段训练

Result: 在两个新构建的部分信息医疗基准测试中，ProMed平均优于最先进方法6.29%，相比被动范式提升54.45%，且在域外案例中表现稳健

Conclusion: ProMed成功将医疗LLM从被动范式转变为主动范式，通过强化学习和信息价值量化显著提升了交互式医疗咨询的诊断准确性

Abstract: Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical
consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients.
While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a
reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional
information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To
address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping
them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before
decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG)
reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the
amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated
via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1)
SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2)
SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a
novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to
informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two
newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and
delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing
robustly to out-of-domain cases.

Motivation: 阿拉伯语语言模型主要支持现代标准阿拉伯语(MSA)，对沙特方言如Najdi和Hijazi支持有限，影响了对真实方言变体的捕捉能力

Method: 使用私有沙特方言指令数据集(5,466条合成指令-响应对)，采用LoRA微调ALLAM-7B-Instruct-preview模型；研究两种方案：方言标签预按和无标签训练

Result: 方言标签模型表现最佳，沙特方言率从47.97%提升到84.21%，MSA泄漏率从32.63%降至6.21%；文本保真度也提升(chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059)，超过多个基线模型

Conclusion: LoRA微调策略能够有效提升阿拉伯语LLM对沙特方言的支持，特别是通过明确的方言标签预按技术可以实现更好的方言控制能力，为少数语言变体的语言模型开发提供了有效路径

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for Arabic are still dominated by Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), with limited support for Saudi dialects such as Najdi
and Hijazi. This underrepresentation hinders their ability to capture authentic
dialectal variation. Using a privately curated Saudi Dialect Instruction
dataset (Hijazi and Najdi; 5,466 synthetic instruction-response pairs; 50/50
split), we LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview, the first foundation model
developed in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi dialect generation. We investigate two
variants: (i) Dialect-Token training, which prepends an explicit dialect tag to
the instruction, and (ii) No-Token training, which omits the tag at formatting
time. Evaluation on a held-out test set combines an external dialect classifier
with text fidelity metrics (chrF++ and BERTScore) and diversity measures. The
Dialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate from
47.97% to 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage from 32.63% to 6.21%; fidelity also
improves (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both LoRA variants outperform strong
generic instruction models (Falcon-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, AceGPT-v2-8B-Chat, JAIS-13B-Chat) in dialect control and
fidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing that these baselines frequently
exhibit. We do not release the dataset or any model weights/adapters; instead,
we release training/evaluation/inference code and a detailed datasheet (schema
and aggregate statistics) to support independent verification.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MATA, a novel evaluation dataset to assess the
ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Telugu language, comprising 729
carefully curated multiple-choice and open-ended questions that span diverse
linguistic dimensions. We evaluate 11 open-weight and closed-source LLMs on our
dataset and present a fine-grained analysis of their performance. Further, we
empirically show how LLMs rely on superficial heuristics such as answer
position and distractor patterns for multiple-choice questions. Finally, we
also compare LLM-as-a-judge evaluation with human evaluation for open-ended
questions and draw some conclusions on its reliability in a low-resource
language. We argue that such fine-grained evaluation is essential for
understanding model limitations and can inform the development of more
linguistically capable LLMs, while also serving as a foundation for future

### [94] [Compressed Models are NOT Trust-equivalent to Their Large Counterparts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13533)
*Rohit Raj Rai,Chirag Kothari,Siddhesh Shelke,Amit Awekar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 模型压缩后虽然精度相似，但在可解释性和检验准确性方面与原始大模型存在显著差异，不能直接作为可信赖的替代品


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注压缩模型的精度性能，但性能相等并不保证可信赖性相等，需要从可解释性和检验准确性两个维度评估压缩模型的可信赖等效性

Method: 提出两维度评估框架：1）可解释性对齐（使用LIME和SHAP测试模型的特征重要性是否一致）；2）检验准确性相似性（通过ECE、MCE、Brier Score和可靠性图评估模型预测概率的可靠性）。以BERT-base为原始模型，对其多种压缩版本在自然语言推理和句子参照识别任务上进行实验

Result: 即使压缩模型与原始模型的精度几乎相同，但可解释性对齐度很低，检验准确性也存在显著差异，表明压缩模型在可信赖性方面与原始大模型并不等效

Conclusion: 压缩模型不能直接作为大模型的可信赖替代品，在部署前需要进行超越简单性能对比的详细评估，特别是可解释性和检验准确性方面的检测

Abstract: Large Deep Learning models are often compressed before being deployed in a
resource-constrained environment. Can we trust the prediction of compressed
models just as we trust the prediction of the original large model? Existing
work has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related
performance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee
trust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence
evaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base
their predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to
measure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures
whether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted
probabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability
diagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its
multiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks:
natural language inference and paraphrase identification. Our results reveal
low interpretability alignment and significant mismatch in calibration
similarity. It happens even when the accuracies are nearly identical between
models. These findings show that compressed models are not trust-equivalent to
their large counterparts. Deploying compressed models as a drop-in replacement
for large models requires careful assessment, going beyond performance parity.

### [95] [A Comparative Study of Decoding Strategies in Medical Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13580)
*Oriana Presacan,Alireza Nik,Vajira Thambawita,Bogdan Ionescu,Michael Riegler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在医疗文本生成任务中，确定性解码策略（如beam search）通常优于随机策略，模型大小和推理时间影响质量，医疗专用模型在部分任务中表现更好但对解码策略更敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗领域，文本生成的准确性至关重要，但解码策略对输出质量的影响尚未得到充分研究。本文旨在探索不同解码策略在医疗文本生成任务中的效果。

Method: 在五个开放式医疗任务（翻译、摘要、问答、对话和图像描述）中评估11种解码策略，使用医疗专用和通用大语言模型，比较不同模型大小和评估指标。

Result: 确定性策略（beam search）表现最佳，随机策略（η和top-k采样）最差；较慢的解码方法质量更好；大模型得分更高但推理时间更长；医疗模型在部分任务中优于通用模型但对解码策略更敏感；不同评估指标间相关性因任务而异。

Conclusion: 解码策略的选择在医疗应用中至关重要，其影响有时甚至超过模型选择本身，需要谨慎选择适合的解码方法以确保输出质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on various decoding strategies to generate
text, and these choices can significantly affect output quality. In healthcare,
where accuracy is critical, the impact of decoding strategies remains
underexplored. We investigate this effect in five open-ended medical tasks,
including translation, summarization, question answering, dialogue, and image
captioning, evaluating 11 decoding strategies with medically specialized and
general-purpose LLMs of different sizes. Our results show that deterministic
strategies generally outperform stochastic ones: beam search achieves the
highest scores, while {\eta} and top-k sampling perform worst. Slower decoding
methods tend to yield better quality. Larger models achieve higher scores
overall but have longer inference times and are no more robust to decoding.
Surprisingly, while medical LLMs outperform general ones in two of the five
tasks, statistical analysis shows no overall performance advantage and reveals
greater sensitivity to decoding choice. We further compare multiple evaluation
metrics and find that correlations vary by task, with MAUVE showing weak
agreement with BERTScore and ROUGE, as well as greater sensitivity to the
decoding strategy. These results highlight the need for careful selection of
decoding methods in medical applications, as their influence can sometimes
exceed that of model choice.

### [96] [Who Gets the Mic? Investigating Gender Bias in the Speaker Assignment of a Speech-LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13603)
*Dariia Puhach,Amir H. Payberah,Éva Székely*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了语音大语言模型Bark在语音输出中的性别偏见问题，通过分析其默认讲话者分配来探索模型是否存在系统性的性别偏吐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然语音LLM与文本LLM都具有出现能力和上下文意识，但是否同样存在性别偏见仍不确定。语音模型必须生成具有性别特征的声音，使得讲话者选择成为显性的偏见线索。

Method: 构建两个数据集：(i)职业数据集（含有性别刻板印象的职业），(ii)性别色彩词汇数据集（含有性别含义的词汇）。分析Bark TTS模型对文本提示的默认讲话者分配。

Result: Bark模型没有显示出系统性的性别偏吐，但显示了性别意识和一些性别倾向性。

Conclusion: 这种通过讲话者分配分析偏见的方法可以作为评估语音LLM偏见的有效工具，虽然Bark没有显示明显系统偏见，但这种分析方法对未来的语音AI偏见研究具有引导意义。

Abstract: Similar to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), Speech-LLMs exhibit
emergent abilities and context awareness. However, whether these similarities
extend to gender bias remains an open question. This study proposes a
methodology leveraging speaker assignment as an analytic tool for bias
investigation. Unlike text-based models, which encode gendered associations
implicitly, Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice, making speaker selection
an explicit bias cue. We evaluate Bark, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, analyzing
its default speaker assignments for textual prompts. If Bark's speaker
selection systematically aligns with gendered associations, it may reveal
patterns in its training data or model design. To test this, we construct two
datasets: (i) Professions, containing gender-stereotyped occupations, and (ii)
Gender-Colored Words, featuring gendered connotations. While Bark does not
exhibit systematic bias, it demonstrates gender awareness and has some gender
inclinations.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) faces significant
challenges when processing long documents in low-resource environments due to
context limitations and insufficient training data. This paper presents
AdaDocVQA, a unified adaptive framework addressing these challenges through
three core innovations: a hybrid text retrieval architecture for effective
document segmentation, an intelligent data augmentation pipeline that
automatically generates high-quality reasoning question-answer pairs with
multi-level verification, and adaptive ensemble inference with dynamic
configuration generation and early stopping mechanisms. Experiments on Japanese
document VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements with 83.04\%
accuracy on Yes/No questions, 52.66\% on factual questions, and 44.12\% on
numerical questions in JDocQA, and 59\% accuracy on LAVA dataset. Ablation
studies confirm meaningful contributions from each component, and our framework
establishes new state-of-the-art results for Japanese document VQA while
providing a scalable foundation for other low-resource languages and

*Tomer Ashuach,Dana Arad,Aaron Mueller,Martin Tutek,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRISP是一种基于稀疏自编码器的参数高效方法，用于实现大型语言模型中的持久性概念遗忘，通过在多个层级识别并抑制关键特征来实现精确的知识移除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实应用中的部署增加，需要选择性移除有害知识同时保持模型效用的方法。现有基于稀疏自编码器的方法主要在推理时操作，无法实现参数层面的持久性改变，容易被恶意行为者绕过。

Method: CRISP方法自动识别多个层级中的显著稀疏自编码器特征，并抑制这些特征的激活。该方法通过特征层面的干预实现参数高效的持久性概念遗忘。

Result: 在两个大型语言模型上的实验表明，CRISP在WMDP基准测试的安全关键遗忘任务上优于先前方法，成功移除有害知识的同时保持通用和领域内能力。特征分析显示该方法实现了目标概念与良性概念的语义分离。

Conclusion: CRISP提供了一种有效的参数高效方法，通过稀疏自编码器特征干预实现大语言模型中的持久性概念遗忘，在安全关键应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, the need to selectively remove unwanted knowledge while
preserving model utility has become paramount. Recent work has explored sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to perform precise interventions on monosemantic features.
However, most SAE-based methods operate at inference time, which does not
create persistent changes in the model's parameters. Such interventions can be
bypassed or reversed by malicious actors with parameter access. We introduce
CRISP, a parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning using
SAEs. CRISP automatically identifies salient SAE features across multiple
layers and suppresses their activations. We experiment with two LLMs and show
that our method outperforms prior approaches on safety-critical unlearning
tasks from the WMDP benchmark, successfully removing harmful knowledge while
preserving general and in-domain capabilities. Feature-level analysis reveals
that CRISP achieves semantically coherent separation between target and benign
concepts, allowing precise suppression of the target features.

*Vy Tuong Dang,An Vo,Quang Tau,Duc Dm,Daeyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ViExam基准测试，首次全面评估了视觉语言模型在多模态越南语教育考试中的表现，发现当前SOTA模型仅达到57.74%准确率，远低于人类平均水平66.54%和最佳表现99.60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型在英语多模态任务上表现出色，但其在低资源语言（如越南语）真实教育内容上的性能尚未得到充分探索，需要评估这些主要基于英语数据训练的模型是否能处理跨语言多模态推理。

Method: 构建ViExam基准测试，包含2,548个多模态问题，涵盖7个学术领域（数学、物理、化学、生物、地理、驾驶测试、智商测试），测试多种VLMs的性能，并尝试跨语言提示和人类协作方法。

Result: SOTA VLMs平均准确率57.74%，开源模型27.70%，均低于人类平均水平66.54%。只有o3思维模型(74.07%)超过人类平均，但仍远低于人类最佳表现(99.60%)。跨语言提示反而降低性能1个百分点，人类协作可提升5个百分点。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在越南语多模态教育评估中表现不佳，跨语言迁移能力有限，需要专门针对低资源语言开发更好的多模态模型，人类协作能部分改善性能但仍需根本性改进。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on English
multimodal tasks, but their performance on low-resource languages with
genuinely multimodal educational content remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we test how VLMs perform on Vietnamese educational assessments,
investigating whether VLMs trained predominantly on English data can handle
real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning. Our work presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of VLM capabilities on multimodal Vietnamese exams
through proposing ViExam, a benchmark containing 2,548 multimodal questions. We
find that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models
achieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics,
Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs
underperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3
(74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially
short of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English
instructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance,
decreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop
collaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.

### [100] [Generics and Default Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13718)
*James Ravi Kirkpatrick,Rachel Katharine Sterken*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文评估了28个大型语言模型在包含通用泛指的可撤销推理模式中的表现，发现前沿模型在默认推理中有一定能力，但CoT提示经常导致性能下降，且大多数模型无法区分可撤销咋演继推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用泛指语句（如"鸟会飞"）在语言学、哲学、逻辑学和认知科学中具有重要意义，它们允许异常情况且是默认推理的核心。研究者想了解LLM在这些复杂的非单调逻辑任务中的表现。

Method: 使用20种不同的可撤销推理模式对28个LLM进行评测，测试了零样本提示、少样本提示和思维链提示（CoT）等不同提示方式的效果。

Result: 前沿模型在默认推理问题上表现良好，但性能波动较大。少样本提示对某些模型有中等改善，但CoT提示导致显著性能下降（在零样本准确率高于75%的模型中，平均下降11.14%）。大多数模型无法区分可撤销推理咋演继推理，或将通用泛指误解为普遍语句。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在默认推理方面既有潜力也有限制，尤其在处理可撤销推理的细腻差别时面临挑战，CoT提示在这类任务中可能不是有效策略。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the capabilities of 28 large language models (LLMs) to
reason with 20 defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations
(e.g., 'Birds fly', 'Ravens are black') central to non-monotonic logic.
Generics are of special interest to linguists, philosophers, logicians, and
cognitive scientists because of their complex exception-permitting behaviour
and their centrality to default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition.
We find that while several frontier models handle many default reasoning
problems well, performance varies widely across models and prompting styles.
Few-shot prompting modestly improves performance for some models, but
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting often leads to serious performance degradation
(mean accuracy drop -11.14%, SD 15.74% in models performing above 75% accuracy
in zero-shot condition, temperature 0). Most models either struggle to
distinguish between defeasible and deductive inference or misinterpret generics
as universal statements. These findings underscore both the promise and limits
of current LLMs for default reasoning.

*Hanna Herasimchyk,Alhassan Abdelhalim,Sören Laue,Michaela Regneri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文挖知了当前用于解释词向量知识编码的方法的限制，证明了预测准确性不能可靠地表明词向量真正含有语义知识，因为这些方法甚至能预测随机信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何更准确地理解深度学习模型中隐含的知识，特别是大语言模型核心组件词向量的知识编码特性，以提高AI系统的可解释性。

Method: 通过对比分析常见的词向量解释方法（将向量映射到人类可解释的语义特征集合），证明这些方法甚至能够成功预测随机信息，显示了单纯依赖预测准确性的偏差。

Result: 发现词向量解释方法的效果主要由算法上限决定，而非真正反映词向量中的语义表征。仅依靠预测性能进行数据集比较不能可靠指示哪个数据集更好地被词向量捐幕。

Conclusion: 当前的词向量知识解释方法主要反映向量空间内的几何相似性，而非真正表明语义属性的出现，需要发展更可靠的解释方法。

Abstract: Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is
essential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines
common methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are
core elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve
mapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features,
known as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these
semantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain
the corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that
prediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based
interpretability.
  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,
concluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic
upper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word
embeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on
prediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better
captured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings
primarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than
indicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EEG-MedRAG是一个基于超图的三层检索增强生成框架，用于统一EEG领域知识、患者病例和大规模存储库，实现联合语义-时间检索和因果链诊断生成，在临床决策支持方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着EEG在神经科学和临床实践中的广泛应用，高效检索和语义解释大规模、多源、异构的EEG数据成为一个紧迫挑战。

Method: 提出EEG-MedRAG框架，构建可遍历的n元关系超图，统一EEG领域知识、个体患者病例和大规模存储库，实现联合语义-时间检索和因果链诊断生成。

Result: 实验表明EEG-MedRAG在答案准确性和检索性能上显著优于TimeRAG和HyperGraphRAG，显示出在真实临床决策支持中的强大潜力。

Conclusion: EEG-MedRAG为解决大规模EEG数据检索和语义解释问题提供了有效解决方案，具有重要的临床应用价值，相关数据和代码已公开。

Abstract: With the widespread application of electroencephalography (EEG) in
neuroscience and clinical practice, efficiently retrieving and semantically
interpreting large-scale, multi-source, heterogeneous EEG data has become a
pressing challenge. We propose EEG-MedRAG, a three-layer hypergraph-based
retrieval-augmented generation framework that unifies EEG domain knowledge,
individual patient cases, and a large-scale repository into a traversable n-ary
relational hypergraph, enabling joint semantic-temporal retrieval and
causal-chain diagnostic generation. Concurrently, we introduce the first
cross-disease, cross-role EEG clinical QA benchmark, spanning seven disorders
and five authentic clinical perspectives. This benchmark allows systematic
evaluation of disease-agnostic generalization and role-aware contextual
understanding. Experiments show that EEG-MedRAG significantly outperforms
TimeRAG and HyperGraphRAG in answer accuracy and retrieval, highlighting its
strong potential for real-world clinical decision support. Our data and code

*Kaiwei Zhang,Qi Jia,Zijian Chen,Wei Sun,Xiangyang Zhu,Chunyi Li,Dandan Zhu,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究大语言模型的奉承性问题，开发了一个统一评估框架来量化用户压力对模型输出的影响，并提出了一种轻量级的Pressure-Tune方法来提升模型的奉承性抵御能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在需要事实严谨性的领域中常常显示出奉承性问题，即无论正确性如何都会与用户信念保持一致。这种倾向在高风险场景中构成严重风险，但在事实问答上却得到不够的关注。

Method: 研究者开发了一个统一的评估框架，包含对抗性提示设置和目标指标（如误导抵御能力和奉承性抵御能力）。同时提出了Pressure-Tune方法，通过在合成的对抗性对话上进行精调，配合链式思维理由来拒绝用户错误信息并强化事实承诺。

Result: 对开源和专有模型的系统评估显示了普遍的奉承性倾向，这主要由对齐策略驱动而非模型规模。Pressure-Tune方法在具有挑战性的科学问答测试集上显著提升了奉承性抵御能力，同时不伤害准确性或对有效反馈的响应能力。

Conclusion: 奉承性是大语言模型在事实问答中的重要问题，Pressure-Tune提供了一种实用的解决方案，能够在不影响模型其他性能的前提下提升模型的真实性和原则性行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), while increasingly used in domains requiring
factual rigor, often display a troubling behavior: sycophancy, the tendency to
align with user beliefs regardless of correctness. This tendency is reinforced
by preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction
but can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,
sycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific
question answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,
decision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this
phenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by
introducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of
sycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much
user-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates
adversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading
resistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to
maintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations
across open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic
tendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate
this issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that
fine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with
chain-of-thought rationales. These rationales reject user misinformation while
reinforcing factual commitments. Experiments on challenging scientific QA
benchmarks show that Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance
without compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback, offering a
practical pathway toward more truthful and principled model behavior.

*Shengchao Liu,Xiaoming Liu,Chengzhengxu Li,Zhaohan Zhang,Guoxin Ma,Yu Lan,Shuai Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MGT-Prism是一个基于频域分析的机器生成文本检测方法，通过低频域过滤和动态频谱对齐策略来提高跨域泛化性能，在11个测试数据集上平均准确率提升0.90%，F1分数提升0.92%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器生成文本检测器在相同领域表现良好，但在跨域场景下泛化能力差，主要原因是不同领域数据之间存在域偏移问题。

Method: 从频域角度分析文本表示，发现不同领域间存在一致的频谱模式，而机器生成文本与人类撰写文本在幅度上存在显著差异。设计了低频域过滤模块过滤对域偏移敏感的文档级特征，以及动态频谱对齐策略提取任务特定和域不变特征。

Result: 在三个域泛化场景下的11个测试数据集上，MGT-Prism平均准确率提升0.90%，F1分数提升0.92%，优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 频域分析为机器生成文本检测提供了新的视角，MGT-Prism通过频域特征处理有效解决了跨域泛化问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown growing ability to generate fluent and
coherent texts that are highly similar to the writing style of humans. Current
detectors for Machine-Generated Text (MGT) perform well when they are trained
and tested in the same domain but generalize poorly to unseen domains, due to
domain shift between data from different sources. In this work, we propose
MGT-Prism, an MGT detection method from the perspective of the frequency domain
for better domain generalization. Our key insight stems from analyzing text
representations in the frequency domain, where we observe consistent spectral
patterns across diverse domains, while significant discrepancies in magnitude
emerge between MGT and human-written texts (HWTs). The observation initiates
the design of a low frequency domain filtering module for filtering out the
document-level features that are sensitive to domain shift, and a dynamic
spectrum alignment strategy to extract the task-specific and domain-invariant
features for improving the detector's performance in domain generalization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test
datasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大型语言模型生成文本与儿童语言的相似性，发现LLM生成的文本更长但词汇丰富度较低，更多依赖高频词，名词使用不足，语义相似性较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在教育中的应用增加，需要了解LLM生成的文本是否能够真实模拟儿童语言特征，这对教育工具的开发具有重要意义。

Method: 使用德国儿童图片故事描述语料库，通过零样本和少样本提示生成LLM文本，比较心理语言学文本属性（词频、词汇丰富度、句子长度、词性标注、语义相似性等）。

Result: LLM生成的文本比儿童文本更长但词汇丰富度低，更多使用高频词，名词代表性不足，语义空间分析显示相似性低。少样本提示略微提高了相似性但仍无法复制词汇和语义模式。

Conclusion: LLM在模拟儿童语言方面存在显著差异，这对LLM在心理语言学研究和儿童教育工具中的应用提出了重要问题，需要谨慎考虑其适用性。

Abstract: The role of large language models (LLMs) in education is increasing, yet
little attention has been paid to whether LLM-generated text resembles child
language. This study evaluates how LLMs replicate child-like language by
comparing LLM-generated texts to a collection of German children's descriptions
of picture stories. We generated two LLM-based corpora using the same picture
stories and two prompt types: zero-shot and few-shot prompts specifying a
general age from the children corpus. We conducted a comparative analysis
across psycholinguistic text properties, including word frequency, lexical
richness, sentence and word length, part-of-speech tags, and semantic
similarity with word embeddings. The results show that LLM-generated texts are
longer but less lexically rich, rely more on high-frequency words, and
under-represent nouns. Semantic vector space analysis revealed low similarity,
highlighting differences between the two corpora on the level of corpus
semantics. Few-shot prompt increased similarities between children and LLM text
to a minor extent, but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns.
The findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs approximate child
language through multimodal prompting (text + image) and give insights into
their use in psycholinguistic research and education while raising important
questions about the appropriateness of LLM-generated language in child-directed
educational tools.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TracSum是一个用于可追溯、基于方面的医学摘要生成的新基准，包含500个医学摘要的3.5K摘要-引用对，提出细粒度评估框架和Track-Then-Sum基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成医学摘要时的事实准确性担忧，通过提供句子级引用让用户能够追溯原始上下文来验证摘要准确性。

Method: 1) 标注500个医学摘要的7个关键医学方面；2) 提出包含4个指标的细粒度评估框架；3) 引入Track-Then-Sum摘要流水线作为基线方法。

Result: 实验表明TracSum可作为有效的基准，显式执行句子级追踪能提高生成准确性，包含完整上下文能进一步改善完整性。

Conclusion: TracSum为可追溯、基于方面的摘要任务提供了有效基准，追踪机制和完整上下文对提高医学摘要质量至关重要。

Abstract: While document summarization with LLMs has enhanced access to textual
information, concerns about the factual accuracy of these summaries persist,
especially in the medical domain. Tracing evidence from which summaries are
derived enables users to assess their accuracy, thereby alleviating this
concern. In this paper, we introduce TracSum, a novel benchmark for traceable,
aspect-based summarization, in which generated summaries are paired with
sentence-level citations, enabling users to trace back to the original context.
First, we annotate 500 medical abstracts for seven key medical aspects,
yielding 3.5K summary-citation pairs. We then propose a fine-grained evaluation
framework for this new task, designed to assess the completeness and
consistency of generated content using four metrics. Finally, we introduce a
summarization pipeline, Track-Then-Sum, which serves as a baseline method for
comparison. In experiments, we evaluate both this baseline and a set of LLMs on
TracSum, and conduct a human evaluation to assess the evaluation results. The
findings demonstrate that TracSum can serve as an effective benchmark for
traceable, aspect-based summarization tasks. We also observe that explicitly
performing sentence-level tracking prior to summarization enhances generation

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用大语言模型通过对话生成代码来解决协作机器人编程的限制，在模拟工业组装场景中评估LLM的代码生成能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协作机器人传统需要专家编程或手动导航，限制了灵活性和表达能力，需要更自然的交互方式

Method: 定义RATS重复组装任务，创建包含人类编写、模板生成和模型生成指令的数据集，系统评估先进LLM在上下文学习中生成组装代码的能力

Result: LLM能够生成准确的一阶代码（指令序列），但在生成高阶代码（函数、循环等抽象）方面遇到困难

Conclusion: 大语言模型在协作机器人对话式编程中有应用潜力，但需要进一步改善高阶抽象能力

Abstract: While there has been a lot of research recently on robots in household
environments, at the present time, most robots in existence can be found on
shop floors, and most interactions between humans and robots happen there.
``Collaborative robots'' (cobots) designed to work alongside humans on assembly
lines traditionally require expert programming, limiting ability to make
changes, or manual guidance, limiting expressivity of the resulting programs.
To address these limitations, we explore using Large Language Models (LLMs),
and in particular, their abilities of doing in-context learning, for
conversational code generation. As a first step, we define RATS, the
``Repetitive Assembly Task'', a 2D building task designed to lay the foundation
for simulating industry assembly scenarios. In this task, a `programmer'
instructs a cobot, using natural language, on how a certain assembly is to be
built; that is, the programmer induces a program, through natural language. We
create a dataset that pairs target structures with various example instructions
(human-authored, template-based, and model-generated) and example code. With
this, we systematically evaluate the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs for
synthesising this kind of code, given in-context examples. Evaluating in a
simulated environment, we find that LLMs are capable of generating accurate
`first order code' (instruction sequences), but have problems producing
`higher-order code' (abstractions such as functions, or use of loops).

### [108] [Beyond Human Judgment: A Bayesian Evaluation of LLMs' Moral Values Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13804)
*Maciej Skorski,Alina Landowska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这项研究通过贝叶斯方法评估了预训练语言模型在道德理解方面的表现，发现AI模型的表现类似于前25%的人类注释者，并且在道德检测方面更为敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的研究使用确定性真实值（多数或包含规则），无法抓取注释者之间的争议。本研究旨在通过模型化注释者不同意见来抓取无效不确定性（内在的人类争议）和认知不确定性（模型领域敏感性）。

Method: 采用GPU优化的贝叶斯框架，对顶级语言模型（Claude Sonnet 4、DeepSeek-V3、Llama 4 Maverick）进行评估。涉及25万+注释、约700名注释者、10万+文本（社交媒体、新闻、论坛），处理了100万+模型查询。

Result: AI模型通常排在人类注释者的前25%，达到比平均水平更好的平衡准确率。特别是，AI产生的假阶性错误比人类要少得多，显示出更为敏感的道德检测能力。

Conclusion: 这是首个大规模贝叶斯评估，证明了预训练语言模型在道德理解方面的优秀表现，特别是在减少假阶性错误方面显示出更好的敏感性。

Abstract: How do large language models understand moral dimensions compared to humans?
  This first large-scale Bayesian evaluation of market-leading language models
provides the answer. In contrast to prior work using deterministic ground truth
(majority or inclusion rules), we model annotator disagreements to capture both
aleatoric uncertainty (inherent human disagreement) and epistemic uncertainty
(model domain sensitivity). We evaluate top language models (Claude Sonnet 4,
DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick) across 250K+ annotations from ~700 annotators on
100K+ texts spanning social media, news, and forums.
  Our GPU-optimized Bayesian framework processed 1M+ model queries, revealing
that AI models typically rank among the top 25\% of human annotators, achieving
much better-than-average balanced accuracy. Importantly, we find that AI
produces far fewer false negatives than humans, highlighting their more
sensitive moral detection capabilities.

### [109] [Prompt-Based One-Shot Exact Length-Controlled Generation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13805)
*Juncheng Xie,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过提示工程在提示中添加倒计数标记和计数规则，使得大语言模型能够在生成文本时同时计数，从而精确控制生成文本长度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在控制文本长度方面面临挑战，经常超过或不足明确的长度指令，因为它们无法可靠地进行内部标记计数

Method: 提出一种基于提示的一次性策略，在提示中附加倒计数标记和明确的计数规则，让模型"边写作边计数"，无需微调或迭代采样

Result: 在MT-Bench-LI任务上，GPT-4.1的严格长度遵循率从累贯提示的30%以下提升到95%以上，超越了流行的草稿-然后修计基线，同时保持了评估答案质量

Conclusion: 精确的长度控制可以仅通过提示工程实现，为训练或解码基于方法提供了轻量级的替代方案

Abstract: Controlling the length of text produced by large language models (LLMs)
remains challenging: models frequently overshoot or undershoot explicit length
instructions because they cannot reliably keep an internal token count. We
present a prompt-based, one-shot strategy that compels an off-the-shelf LLM to
generate exactly a desired number of tokens - words (English) or characters
(Chinese) - without any fine-tuning or iterative sampling. The prompt appends
countdown markers and explicit counting rules so that the model "writes while
counting." We evaluate on four settings: open-ended generation (1-1000 tokens),
XSUM summarization, MT-Bench-LI instruction following, and the LIFEBENCH
equal-length track. On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 leaps
from below 30% under naive prompts to above 95% with our countdown prompt,
surpassing the popular draft-then-revise baseline, while judged answer quality
is preserved. These results show that precise length control can be achieved
through prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to
training- or decoding-based methods.

Motivation: 自动评价指标在自然语言生成预估人类判断无绝对标准，需根据任务特定需求选择并重视验证方法

Method: 对现有评价指标进行系统检查，分析其方法论、文档优势、限制、验证方法以及与人类判断的相关性

Result: 识别主要挑战：指标仅抓取文本质量特定方面，效果随任务和数据集而异，验证实践结构化不足，与人类判断相关性不一致，包括LLM-as-a-Judge和RAG评价

Conclusion: 挑战对完美指标的追求，建议根据任务特定需求选择指标，利用补充性评价，并为新指标开发更强大的验证方法

Abstract: Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical
adoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human
evaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks
scalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various
automatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with
human-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.
Over time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic
similarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it
seems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in
studies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This
paper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the
methodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,
validation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several
key challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,
their effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain
unstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.
Importantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of
metric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our
findings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'. We propose selecting
metrics based on task-specific needs and leveraging complementary evaluations
and advocate that new metrics should focus on enhanced validation
methodologies.

Abstract: This study explores the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM)
with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the extraction of
requirements from unstructured French Building Technical Specification (BTS)
documents within the construction industry. Employing Named Entity Recognition
(NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) techniques, the study leverages the
transformer-based model CamemBERT and applies transfer learning with the French
language model Fr\_core\_news\_lg, both pre-trained on a large French corpus in
the general domain. To benchmark these models, additional approaches ranging
from rule-based to deep learning-based methods are developed. For RE, four
different supervised models, including Random Forest, are implemented using a
custom feature vector. A hand-crafted annotated dataset is used to compare the
effectiveness of NER approaches and RE models. Results indicate that CamemBERT
and Fr\_core\_news\_lg exhibited superior performance in NER, achieving
F1-scores over 90\%, while Random Forest proved most effective in RE, with an
F1 score above 80\%. The outcomes are intended to be represented as a knowledge
graph in future work to further enhance automatic verification systems.

*Jiacheng Ruan,Dan Jiang,Xian Gao,Ting Liu,Yuzhuo Fu,Yangyang Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MME-SCI是一个针对多模态大语言模型在科学领域的综合性评估基准，涵盖数学、物理、化学、生物四大学科，支持五种语言，包含1019个高质量问答对，评估结果显示现有模型在该基准上表现不佳，特别是在图像模式下的准确率较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学领域基准存在三个关键挑战：1）多语言场景下模型推理能力评估不足；2）对MLLMs多模态覆盖的全面性评估不够；3）缺乏对科学知识点的细粒度标注。

Method: 收集了1019个高质量问答对，涵盖4个学科（数学、物理、化学、生物）和5种语言（中文、英文、法文、西班牙文、日文），包含3种评估模式，对16个开源模型和4个闭源模型进行了广泛实验。

Result: 实验结果显示MME-SCI对现有MLLMs具有广泛挑战性，例如在仅图像评估模式下，o4-mini在数学、物理、化学、生物上的准确率分别仅为52.11%、24.73%、36.57%和29.80%，难度显著高于现有基准。

Conclusion: MME-SCI是一个全面且具有挑战性的基准，通过其多语言和细粒度知识属性，能够深入分析现有模型在特定领域的弱点，为MLLMs在科学领域的评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant
advancements across various domains, and corresponding evaluation benchmarks
have been continuously refined and improved. In this process, benchmarks in the
scientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key
challenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in
multilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive
modality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge
points. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality
question-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs
cover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and
support five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We
conducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source
models, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for
existing MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini
achieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly
higher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly,
using MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed
existing models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in
specific domains. The Data and Evaluation Code are available at

Abstract: In the hospitality industry, understanding the factors that drive customer
review ratings is critical for improving guest satisfaction and business
performance. This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP),
a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge
graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating
sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the
framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers.
We compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag
of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating
them in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature,
our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with
lower computational cost (without ensemble).
  While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and
outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it
offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and
potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This
work highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing
review analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating
advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods. We
will share ReviewGraph output and platform open-sourced on our GitHub page

Conclusion: 该方法通过智能的上下文块选择和DPO训练，有效提升了LLM处理长上下文任务的能力，为解决长上下文建模中的数据质量问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Long-context modeling is critical for a wide range of real-world tasks,
including long-context question answering, summarization, and complex reasoning
tasks. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)
with synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the
effectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and
factual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we
propose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)
rollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long
context for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing
preference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.
Specifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on
their expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and
iteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and
exploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context
segments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses.
Finally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and
apply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. Experimental results show
that LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference
data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning
benchmarks. All code and data will be released on

TL;DR: 提出SvS策略，通过自我对弈和变分问题合成来解决RLVR训练中的策略熵崩塌问题，显著提升Pass@k性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练在提升Pass@1性能的同时会导致策略熵下降，减少生成多样性，从而限制Pass@k性能的上限

Method: 在线自我对弈与变分问题合成(SvS)策略，利用策略的正确解合成变分问题，保持参考答案不变

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25基准上Pass@32性能分别获得18.3%和22.8%的绝对提升，在12个推理基准和3B-32B模型规模上均表现一致

Conclusion: SvS策略能有效维持训练过程中的策略熵，持续改善性能，展现出良好的泛化性和鲁棒性

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for
complex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to
improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced
generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically
represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective
of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems
helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations,
we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS)
strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to
synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain
identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains
policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with
standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains
of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and
AIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model
sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and
robustness of SvS.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在演变为能够规划和交互的智能体系统时，通常通过微调来提升任务执行能力，但这一过程往往忽视了安全性问题，导致原本对齐的模型可能变得不对齐，更容易执行有害任务。

Method: 提出Prefix INjection Guard (PING)方法，采用迭代方式：(1)生成候选前缀，(2)选择既能优化任务性能又能增强拒绝行为的前缀，将这些自然语言前缀预置到智能体响应中。

Result: 实验表明PING显著提升了微调LLM智能体的安全性，且不牺牲有效性。在网页导航和代码生成任务中，PING持续优于现有提示方法。线性探针分析显示前缀标记对行为修改至关重要。

Conclusion: PING是一种简单有效的解决方案，能够解决LLM智能体微调过程中的安全隐患，通过自然语言前缀引导模型安全行为，为构建更安全的AI智能体提供了可行途径。

Abstract: Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into
agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to
solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific
tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently
overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned
LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of
executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned
to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix
INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends
automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding
them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)
generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task
performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING
significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing
their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting
approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation
tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that
prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance
gains. WARNING: This paper contains contents that are unethical or offensive in

Abstract: Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays. The sophisticated
analysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional
and medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML
approaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in
healthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these
challenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit
emotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment
Analysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large
Language Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context
learning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data
analysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically
encodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply
domain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive
training. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are
compared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based
methods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior
performance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,
with no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement
levels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern
recognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by
in-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.
This approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in
digital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for
patient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health
strategies.

Method: 采用新颖的SG-MLP采样结构结合PR-MLP进行体素预渲染，引入渐进式语义建模来提取多精度语义信息。

Result: 在7个合成场景的6个评估指标中，PreSem-Surf在C-L1、F-score和IoU方面表现最佳，在NC、准确性和完整性方面保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高效训练的同时显著提升了场景重建质量，证明了其有效性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper proposes PreSem-Surf, an optimized method based on the Neural
Radiance Field (NeRF) framework, capable of reconstructing high-quality scene
surfaces from RGB-D sequences in a short time. The method integrates RGB,
depth, and semantic information to improve reconstruction performance.
Specifically, a novel SG-MLP sampling structure combined with PR-MLP
(Preconditioning Multilayer Perceptron) is introduced for voxel pre-rendering,
allowing the model to capture scene-related information earlier and better
distinguish noise from local details. Furthermore, progressive semantic
modeling is adopted to extract semantic information at increasing levels of
precision, reducing training time while enhancing scene understanding.
Experiments on seven synthetic scenes with six evaluation metrics show that
PreSem-Surf achieves the best performance in C-L1, F-score, and IoU, while
maintaining competitive results in NC, Accuracy, and Completeness,
demonstrating its effectiveness and practical applicability.

Result: 在保持视觉保真度（每时间步相对位移误差约1%）的同时，在相同硬件上实现高达13倍的加速

Conclusion: 该方法能够在保持IPC黄金标准质量的同时显著提升计算效率，解决了传统方法在处理刚性和异质材料时的收敛问题

Abstract: We present a multi-level elastodynamics timestep solver for accelerating
incremental potential contact (IPC) simulations. Our method retains the
robustness of gold standard IPC in the face of intricate geometry, complex
heterogeneous material distributions and high resolution input data without
sacrificing visual fidelity (per-timestep relative displacement error of
$\approx1\%$). The success of our method is enabled by a novel, sparse,
geometry- and material-aware basis construction method which allows for the use
of fast preconditioned conjugate gradient solvers (in place of a sparse direct
solver), but without suffering convergence issues due to stiff or heterogeneous
materials. The end result is a solver that produces results visually
indistinguishable and quantitatively very close to gold-standard IPC methods
but up to $13\times$ faster on identical hardware.

TL;DR: DiffPlanner是一个基于Transformer的条件扩散模型，直接在向量空间生成边界约束的平面图布局，避免了传统方法中向量-栅格-向量的转换过程和信息损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习型方法需要将向量数据转换为栅格图像，使用基于图像的生成模型，然后再转换回向量数据。这个过程复杂冗余，会导致信息损失，且栅格图像无法无损缩放。

Method: 提出基于Transformer的条件扩散模型，在训练中集成对齐机制，将模型优化轨迹与设计师的迭代设计过程对齐，直接在向量空间处理复杂数据。

Result: 通过定量比较、定性评估、消融实验和感知研究，证明DiffPlanner在生成平面图和气泡图方面超越了现有最先进方法，提供更好的可控性和更接近真实结果的质量。

Conclusion: DiffPlanner框架能够更好地处理复杂向量数据，拟合预测目标分布，完成具有挑战性的平面图布局设计任务，并实现用户可控的生成。

Abstract: The boundary-constrained floor plan generation problem aims to generate the
topological and geometric properties of a set of rooms within a given boundary.
Recently, learning-based methods have made significant progress in generating
realistic floor plans. However, these methods involve a workflow of converting
vector data into raster images, using image-based generative models, and then
converting the results back into vector data. This process is complex and
redundant, often resulting in information loss. Raster images, unlike vector
data, cannot scale without losing detail and precision. To address these
issues, we propose a novel deep learning framework called DiffPlanner for
boundary-constrained floor plan generation, which operates entirely in vector
space. Our framework is a Transformer-based conditional diffusion model that
integrates an alignment mechanism in training, aligning the optimization
trajectory of the model with the iterative design processes of designers. This
enables our model to handle complex vector data, better fit the distribution of
the predicted targets, accomplish the challenging task of floor plan layout
design, and achieve user-controllable generation. We conduct quantitative
comparisons, qualitative evaluations, ablation experiments, and perceptual
studies to evaluate our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DiffPlanner surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in generating floor
plans and bubble diagrams in the creative stages, offering more controllability
to users and producing higher-quality results that closely match the ground
truths.

TL;DR: Sketch3DVE是一个基于草图的3D感知视频编辑方法，能够处理大视角变化下的视频结构内容编辑，通过点云编辑和3D感知掩码传播实现精确的几何控制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法在风格迁移和外观修改方面效果良好，但在处理3D场景结构内容编辑，特别是大视角变化（如大角度相机旋转或缩放）时仍面临挑战，需要解决新视角内容生成、未编辑区域保持和稀疏2D输入到3D视频输出的转换问题

Method: 使用图像编辑方法生成第一帧的编辑结果并传播到后续帧；利用草图进行精确几何控制；通过密集立体方法估计点云和相机参数；提出基于深度图的点云编辑方法表示新编辑组件的3D几何；采用3D感知掩码传播策略和视频扩散模型实现无缝融合

Result: 大量实验证明了Sketch3DVE在视频编辑方面的优越性

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了大视角变化下3D场景结构编辑的挑战，实现了精确的局部操作和真实的3D视频输出

Abstract: Recent video editing methods achieve attractive results in style transfer or
appearance modification. However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes
in videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant
viewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms. Key challenges
include generating novel view content that remains consistent with the original
video, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into
realistic 3D video outputs. To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a
sketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local
manipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the
challenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate
edited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining
frames of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise
geometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also
supported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and
manipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a
dense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the
input video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth
maps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them
effectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited
content with the original video while preserving the features of unedited
regions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video
diffusion model to produce realistic edited videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of Sketch3DVE in video editing. Homepage and code:

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has gained significant attention for its
prominent implicit 3D representation and realistic novel view synthesis
capabilities. Available works unexceptionally employ straight-line volume
rendering, which struggles to handle sophisticated lightpath scenarios and
introduces geometric ambiguities during training, particularly evident when
processing motion-blurred images. To address these challenges, this work
proposes a novel deblur neural radiance field, Is-NeRF, featuring explicit
lightpath modeling in real-world environments. By unifying six common light
propagation phenomena through an in-scattering representation, we establish a
new scattering-aware volume rendering pipeline adaptable to complex lightpaths.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive learning strategy that enables
autonomous determining of scattering directions and sampling intervals to
capture finer object details. The proposed network jointly optimizes NeRF
parameters, scattering parameters, and camera motions to recover fine-grained
scene representations from blurry images. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate
that it effectively handles complex real-world scenarios, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity images with accurate
geometric details.

Result: 在web agent和code agent多个基准上创造了新的最高性能纪录

Conclusion: 链式机器人框架能在单模型中实现精细的多机器协作，为机器人模型研究提供了坚实基础

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as
deep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing
multi-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with
sophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less
capable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we
introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables
native end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent
system (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple
agents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model
dynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate
multi-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end
chain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent
distillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into
chain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use
agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve
the models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the
resulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies
demonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the
entire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation,
and the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point
for future research on agent models and agentic RL.

### [125] [Cognitive Workspace: Active Memory Management for LLMs -- An Empirical Study of Functional Infinite Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13171)
*Tao An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Cognitive Workspace是一种新的LLM上下文管理范式，通过模拟人类外部记忆使用的认知机制，超越了传统的检索增强生成(RAG)方法，实现了主动记忆管理和任务驱动的动态优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM尽管上下文窗口扩展到百万token，但在上下文管理上存在根本性限制。传统被动检索系统无法捕捉人类记忆管理的动态性和任务驱动特性，缺乏元认知意识和主动规划能力。

Method: 基于Baddeley工作记忆模型、Clark扩展心智理论和Hutchins分布式认知框架，提出三个核心创新：(1)主动记忆管理与刻意信息策展；(2)分层认知缓冲区实现持久工作状态；(3)任务驱动的动态上下文优化。

Result: 实证验证显示Cognitive Workspace平均达到58.6%的记忆重用率（传统RAG为0%），净效率增益17-18%，统计显著性p < 0.001，Cohen's d > 23。

Conclusion: Cognitive Workspace代表了从信息检索到真正认知增强的根本性转变，为LLM系统提供了首个主动记忆优越性的定量证据。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental limitations in context
management despite recent advances extending context windows to millions of
tokens. We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends
traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive
mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations
including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and
Hutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive
retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human
memory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while
techniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context
lengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities
essential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these
limitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with
deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling
persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that
dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates
Cognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from
54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%
net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis
confirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple
task types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory
superiority in LLM systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework
synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers, positioning Cognitive Workspace
as a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive
augmentation.

TL;DR: 提出了AlphaEval框架，用于自动化alpha挖掘模型的统一、可并行、免回测评估，解决了传统评估方法的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有alpha挖掘评估方法存在计算密集型、参数敏感、忽视多维度质量属性等问题，且大多数模型闭源阻碍了领域发展

Method: 开发了AlphaEval框架，从五个互补维度评估alpha质量：预测能力、稳定性、市场扰动鲁棒性、金融逻辑性和多样性

Result: 实验表明AlphaEval在评估一致性上与全面回测相当，但提供更全面的洞察和更高效率，并能有效识别优于传统单指标筛选的alpha

Conclusion: AlphaEval为alpha挖掘提供了更高效、全面的评估解决方案，开源实现促进了可重现性和社区参与

Abstract: Formula alpha mining, which generates predictive signals from financial data,
is critical for quantitative investment. Although various algorithmic
approaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large
language models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery,
systematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics
predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting
is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific
strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only
predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal
stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the
closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders
reproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we
propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation
framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall
quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive
power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and
diversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms
demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to
comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and
higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior
alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All
implementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote
reproducibility and community engagement.

Result: 精确确定了计算复杂度，设计了相应算法，分析了拟合本体和TGD的大小特性，并发现有限基在某些TGD类中不存在

Conclusion: 该研究为从示例中学习本体和约束提供了理论基础和实用算法，但某些TGD类无法构建有限基，这限制了其应用范围

Abstract: We study the problem of fitting ontologies and constraints to positive and
negative examples that take the form of a finite relational structure. As
ontology and constraint languages, we consider the description logics
$\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$ and $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$ as well as several
classes of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs): full, guarded,
frontier-guarded, frontier-one, and unrestricted TGDs as well as inclusion
dependencies. We pinpoint the exact computational complexity, design
algorithms, and analyze the size of fitting ontologies and TGDs. We also
investigate the related problem of constructing a finite basis of concept
inclusions / TGDs for a given set of finite structures. While finite bases
exist for $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$, $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$, guarded TGDs,
and inclusion dependencies, they in general do not exist for full,
frontier-guarded and frontier-one TGDs.

Conclusion: 该研究为处理基础数据库查询提供了准确性提升方案，并为处理复杂查询和实际数据库中不规则数据的研究提供了新视角

Abstract: To elevate the foundational capabilities and generalization prowess of the

culminating in the design of the CESQL model that facilitates conditional
enhancement. Our model excels on the WikiSQL dataset, which is emblematic of
single-table database query tasks, markedly boosting the accuracy of prediction
outcomes. When predicting conditional values in WHERE clauses, we have not only
minimized our dependence on data within the condition columns of tables but
also circumvented the impact of manually labeled training data. Our hope is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别基于搜索的LLM代理评估中存在一种类似于数据污染的新问题：查找时污染，导致代理通过在线搜索直接获取测试数据集和答案，从而影响评测结果的真实性和可靠性。

Method: 在三个常用能力测试集（HLE、SimpleQA、GPQA）上进行实验，分析搜索基于代理的日志记录，识别HuggingFace等平台是否被搜索到并包含测试问题和答案。通过阻断HuggingFace来验证污染效果，并进行消融实验查找其他潜在污染源。

Result: 约3%的测试问题能够直接从HuggingFace找到包含标签的数据集。阻断HuggingFace后，被污染问题子集的准确率下降了15%。研究还发现公开可访的评估数据集可能不是唯一的污染源。

Conclusion: 查找时污染会快速加速测试集的淘汰，缩短其设计周期。建议采取更严格的标准化评测方法和结果报告规范，以确保基于搜索的LLM代理评估的可信质量。研究公开了完整的实验日志以便审计验证。

Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model
training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and
compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time
contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to
gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs
when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a
near-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than
genuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that
HuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among
retrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often
explicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace
within their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for
approximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets
with ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries
target the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the
benchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace
is blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of
approximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly
accessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of
STC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design
and result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure
trustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing
of evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our
experiments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QuickMerge是一个轻量级token合并框架，通过注意力范数动态选择重要token，使用基于熵的预算估计器，并引入轻量级transformer先验来保持自回归兼容性，显著减少计算成本的同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型处理更大规模输入，token级别的计算成本成为主要瓶颈。现有token选择方法大多是静态的、模态特定的，或者与自回归生成不兼容。

Method: 基于注意力范数幅度动态选择token，使用熵基预算估计器确定token数量，引入轻量级transformer先验在合并后的token序列上进行训练以保持自回归兼容性。

Result: 在多模态领域评估显示，QuickMerge在计算-准确率权衡方面取得一致改进，显著减少token数量的同时匹配甚至超过学习型tokenizer和固定patch基线的性能。

Conclusion: QuickMerge通过语义显著性估计、灵活token预算和自回归对齐的组合，实现了用更少token进行准确生成的有效框架。

Abstract: As generative models scale to larger inputs across language, vision, and
video domains, the cost of token-level computation has become a key bottleneck.
While prior work suggests that only a subset of tokens significantly influence
downstream predictions, most token selection methods are static,
modality-specific, or incompatible with autoregressive generation. In this
paper, we propose QuickMerge, a lightweight token merging framework designed
for efficient next-token prediction.
  QuickMerge dynamically selects a reduced number of tokens based on attention
norm magnitude, guided by an entropy-based budget estimator. To preserve
autoregressive compatibility, we introduce a lightweight transformer prior
trained over the merged token sequence. By combining semantic salience
estimation, flexible token budgets, and AR alignment, QuickMerge enables
accurate generation with fewer tokens.
  We evaluate QuickMerge across multi-modality domains, demonstrating
consistent improvements in compute-accuracy tradeoffs. Specifically, QuickMerge
reduces token counts sustantially while matching as well as exceeding the
performance of learned tokenizers and fixed-patch baselines.

Method: 提出基于网络的棋子相互作用指标，用于量化棋局中的战略紧张度，并分析人类vs人类和AIvsAI游戏的动态变化

Result: AI玩家能持续保持比人类更高的战略紧张度；人类游戏的紧张度在1600和2300Elo等级出现突然增长；AI对攻防平衡的复杂局面具有更高容忍力

Conclusion: AI与人类在战略决策中采取不同探索方式，这种差异对于复杂战略环境中的AI应用具有重要意义

Abstract: Strategic decision-making involves managing the tension between immediate
opportunities and long-term objectives. We study this trade-off in chess by
characterizing and comparing dynamics between human vs human and AI vs AI
games. We propose a network-based metric of piece-to-piece interaction to
quantify the ongoing strategic tension on the board. Its evolution in games
reveals that the most competitive AI players sustain higher levels of strategic
tension for longer durations than elite human players. Cumulative tension
varies with algorithmic complexity for AI and correspondingly in human-played
games increases abruptly with expertise at about 1600 Elo and again at 2300
Elo. The profiles reveal different approaches. Highly competitive AI tolerates
interconnected positions balanced between offensive and defensive tactics over
long periods. Human play, in contrast, limits tension and game complexity,
which may reflect cognitive limitations and adaptive strategies. The difference
may have implications for AI usage in complex, strategic environments.

Abstract: In large language model-based agents, memory serves as a critical capability
for achieving personalization by storing and utilizing users' information.
Although some previous studies have adopted memory to implement user
personalization, they typically focus on preference alignment and simple
question-answering. However, in the real world, complex tasks often require
multi-hop reasoning on a large amount of user information, which poses
significant challenges for current memory approaches. To address this
limitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how
different memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized
information. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with
a unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and
implicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments. We evaluate
their performance on this task from multiple perspectives and analyze their
strengths and weaknesses. Besides, we explore hybrid approaches that combine
both paradigms and propose the HybridMem method to address their limitations.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model through extensive
experiments. To benefit the research community, we release this project at
https://github.com/nuster1128/MPR.

Motivation: 科学文献中大量材料数据被困在非结构化的图表中，阻碍了基于大语言模型的AI智能体进行自动化材料设计

Method: 提出DIVE多智能体工作流，系统读取科学文献中的图形元素并组织实验数据，专注于固态氢存储材料

Result: DIVE相比多模态模型直接提取，精度提升10-15%（商业模型）和30%以上（开源模型），建立了包含3万条数据的数据库，能在2分钟内识别未报道的氢存储成分

Conclusion: 该AI工作流和智能体设计可广泛适用于多种材料，为AI驱动的材料发现提供了新范式

Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are fundamentally
transforming the discovery of new materials. Despite the unprecedented
availability of materials data in the scientific literature, much of this
information remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables, hindering the
construction of large language model (LLM)-based AI agent for automated
materials design. Here, we present the Descriptive Interpretation of Visual
Expression (DIVE) multi-agent workflow, which systematically reads and
organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific literatures.
We focus on solid-state hydrogen storage materials-a class of materials central
to future clean-energy technologies and demonstrate that DIVE markedly improves
the accuracy and coverage of data extraction compared to the direct extraction
by multimodal models, with gains of 10-15% over commercial models and over 30%
relative to open-source models. Building on a curated database of over 30,000
entries from 4,000 publications, we establish a rapid inverse design workflow
capable of identifying previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in
two minutes. The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable
across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials
discovery.

TL;DR: 卡达AI助手（CardAIc-Agents）是一个多模态框架，通过外部工具和适应性计划执行，解决了AI在心血管疾病预防诊断中的四大问题，在三个数据集上都显示出更优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球首要死因，医疗资源短缺。AI助手有潜力解决这一问题，但当前存在四大限制：1）依赖内置能力缺少领域工具支持；2）固化工作流而临床需要适应性思维；3）短缺持续学习能力；4）输入输出模式固化缺少可视化支持。

Method: 提出CardAIc-Agents多模态框架：1）CardiacRAG助手从可更新知识库生成通用计划；2）主助手集成工具自主执行计划并做出决策；3）步进更新策略根据执行结果动态调整计划；4）多学科讨论工具处理复杂案例；5）可视化审查面板支持医生验证。

Conclusion: CardAIc-Agents通过外部工具集成、适应性计划执行、动态知识更新和多模态可视化支持，有效解决了AI在心血管疾病预防诊断中的关键挑战，为临床应用提供了更加灵活和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the foremost cause of mortality
worldwide, a burden worsened by a severe deficit of healthcare workers.
Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have shown potential to alleviate this gap
via automated early detection and proactive screening, yet their clinical
application remains limited by: 1) prompt-based clinical role assignment that
relies on intrinsic model capabilities without domain-specific tool support; or
2) rigid sequential workflows, whereas clinical care often requires adaptive
reasoning that orders specific tests and, based on their results, guides
personalised next steps; 3) general and static knowledge bases without
continuous learning capability; and 4) fixed unimodal or bimodal inputs and
lack of on-demand visual outputs when further clarification is needed. In
response, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment
models with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.
Specifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac
knowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these
plans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific
customization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine
plans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as
complex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to
interpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When
clinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final
validation. Experiments across three datasets showed the efficiency of
CardAIc-Agents compared to mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的自动启发式设计方法使用静态算子且缺乏知识积累机制，限制了其有效性

Method: 提出HiFo-Prompt框架，包含两种协同提示策略：前瞻性提示基于种群动态自适应引导搜索，管理探索-利用权衡；后顾性提示从过往成功启发式中提炼可重用设计原则

Result: 实验结果表明HiFo-Prompt显著优于现有LLM-based AHD方法，生成更高质量启发式，收敛更快且查询效率更高

Conclusion: 双机制设计将瞬时发现转化为持久知识库，使LLM能够从自身经验中学习，实现了知识积累和性能提升

Abstract: LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) within Evolutionary Computation
(EC) frameworks has shown promising results. However, its effectiveness is
hindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation
mechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two
synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based
prompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic
human expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into
fundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms
transient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to
learn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating
higher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and
superior query efficiency.

### [138] [LOOP: A Plug-and-Play Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Enhancing Planning in Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13371)
*Ronit Virwani,Ruchika Suryawanshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even
a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current
state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,
producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and
hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack
the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for
modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot
translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for
neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To
address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework
that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic
components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated
neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,
multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical
decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from
both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL
specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds
a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six
standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared
to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This
work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural
networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to
each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for
building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical
real-world applications.

TL;DR: SPANER是一个模态无关的参数高效微调框架，通过共享提示机制将不同模态输入嵌入到统一语义空间，提升跨模态泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态PEFT方法主要关注任务特定性能提升，但忽视了多模态嵌入空间的结构，导致模态特定表示孤立，限制了跨模态泛化

Method: 提出SPANER框架，采用共享提示机制作为概念锚点，使语义相关的实例在空间中收敛，支持无缝集成新模态（如音频）而无需改变核心架构

Result: 在视觉-语言和音频-视觉基准测试中，SPANER展示了竞争力的少样本检索性能，同时在学习嵌入空间中保持了高语义一致性

Conclusion: 研究表明，对齐嵌入结构而不仅仅是调整适配器权重，对于可扩展的多模态学习至关重要

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have
significantly improved performance on downstream tasks such as few-shot
retrieval. However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while
neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result,
modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal
generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a
modality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse
modalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared
prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically
related instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared
prompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of
additional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture.
Through comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual
benchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance
while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our
results highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than
merely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TASER是一个持续学习的智能表格提取系统，专门处理金融文档中高度非结构化、多页、异构的表格，通过模式引导的提取和推荐实现比现有方法更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界金融文档中的表格信息往往埋藏在混乱的多页碎片化表格中，99.4%的表格没有边界框，最大行数达426行，需要专门的方法来处理这些独特挑战。

Method: 开发了TASER系统，包含表格检测、分类、提取和推荐代理，利用初始模式执行任务，推荐代理审查输出并建议模式修订，实现持续学习。

Result: TASER在表格检测方面比Table Transformer提升10.1%，大批量处理使可操作模式建议增加104.3%，提取的持仓量增加9.8%。构建了包含22,584页、3,213个表格、7310亿美元持仓的真实金融数据集。

Conclusion: 智能模式引导的提取系统在理解现实世界金融表格方面展现出巨大潜力，发布了TASERTab数据集供研究社区使用。

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's
financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument
types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented
tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes
with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To
tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a
continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for
Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured,
multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs.
Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and
recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent
reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final
recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models
such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we
highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema
recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase
in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning
process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449
tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of
the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to
enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and
outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction
systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.

Conclusion: 这是向能够通过真实实验测试假设的具身AI迈出的一步，可自主探索人类认知和资源限制可能无法触及的科学领域，但引发了关于科学理解本质和科学贡献归属的重要问题

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by
accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to
materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial
human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing
domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge
across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of
more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a
domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific
workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript
preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological
studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness,
executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed
analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced
completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific
discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning
and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with
limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step
toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments,
accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space
that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored.
It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and
the attribution of scientific credit.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic forecasting is challenging due to complex temporal
patterns, dynamic spatial structures, and diverse input formats. Although
Transformer-based models offer strong global modeling, they often struggle with
rigid temporal encoding and weak space-time fusion. We propose STPFormer, a
Spatio-Temporal Pattern-Aware Transformer that achieves state-of-the-art

integrates four modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware
temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial
learning, Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM) for cross-domain alignment,
and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world

Result: 在语言模型量化中比现有方法提升14%，离散成像重建错误降低16%且GPU速度提升6倍，FIR滤波器设计波红减少50%

Conclusion: DMMV作为一种通用优化问题框架具有广泛应用价值，所提贫例算法在多个领域都取得显著效果，将开源以促进进一步研究

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV) as a general optimization
problem which seeks an assignment of discrete values to variables that
minimizes the largest constraint violation. This context-free mathematical
formulation is applicable to a wide range of use cases that have worst-case
performance requirements. After defining the DMMV problem mathematically, we
explore its properties to establish a foundational understanding. To tackle
DMMV instance sizes of practical relevance, we develop a GPU-accelerated
heuristic that takes advantage of the mathematical properties of DMMV for
speeding up the solution process. We demonstrate the versatile applicability of
our heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1)
post-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3)
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier
separation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing
methods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under
uniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU. For FIR
filter design, it nearly achieves 50% ripple reduction compared to using the
commercial integer optimization solver, Gurobi. Our comparative results point
to the benefits of studying DMMV as a context-free optimization problem and the
advantages that our proposed heuristic offers on three distinct problems. Our
GPU-accelerated heuristic will be made open-source to further stimulate
research on DMMV and its other applications. The code is available at

Motivation: 语言模型代理在安全关键场景中存在严重风险，但其风险意识与安全执行能力之间存在显著差距

Method: 构建了一个综合评估框架，从风险知识、执行轨迹风险识别和实际行为三个维度评估代理安全性，并发展了风险验证器系统

Result: 发现代理风险知识几乎完美（>98%），但实际风险识别性能下降23%，执行危险行为率仅26%，风险验证器系统能减少55.3%危险行为

Conclusion: 简单扩大模型能力或计算资源并不能解决安全问题，需要专门的风险验证机制来提升代理安全性

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for
automating real-world tasks, yet they pose a diverse array of potential, severe
risks in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we identify a significant gap
between LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they
often answer "Yes" to queries like "Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?",
they will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or
even directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To
systematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation
framework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)
their knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify
corresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to
avoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical
performance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:
while agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\%$ pass rates), they
fail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with
performance dropping by $>23\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\%$
pass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in
specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling
model capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety
concerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk
verifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an
abstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract
descriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall
system achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by $55.3\%$
over vanilla-prompted agents.

Abstract: Developing general-purpose embodied agents is a core challenge in AI.
Minecraft provides rich complexity and internet-scale data, but its slow speed
and engineering overhead make it unsuitable for rapid prototyping. Crafter
offers a lightweight alternative that retains key challenges from Minecraft,
yet its use has remained limited to narrow tasks due to the absence of
foundation models that have driven progress in the Minecraft setting. In this
paper, we present CrafterDojo, a suite of foundation models and tools that
unlock the Crafter environment as a lightweight, prototyping-friendly, and
Minecraft-like testbed for general-purpose embodied agent research. CrafterDojo
addresses this by introducing CrafterVPT, CrafterCLIP, and CrafterSteve-1 for
behavior priors, vision-language grounding, and instruction following,
respectively. In addition, we provide toolkits for generating behavior and
caption datasets (CrafterPlay and CrafterCaption), reference agent
implementations, benchmark evaluations, and a complete open-source codebase.

Method: 两阶段训练框架：第一阶段使用专家引导的蒙特卡洛树搜索构建高质量推理轨迹初始化策略；第二阶段通过强化学习将LLM注意力与专家模型识别的临床显著特征对齐

Result: 在两个真实世界EHR数据集上，EAG-RL平均提升LLM的EHR推理能力14.62%，增强了对特征扰动的鲁棒性和对未见临床领域的泛化能力

Conclusion: EAG-RL展示了在临床预测任务中实际部署的潜力，能够有效提升LLM在电子健康记录推理中的内在能力

Abstract: Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR)
reasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical
predictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform
on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally
structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid
paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream
deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's
intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of
DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework
designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert
attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models
trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise
reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to
effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the
policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with
clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive
experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the
intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also
enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen

TL;DR: 这篇论文探索多模态结构化强化学习(MSRL)在图表到代码生成任务中的应用，通过多粒度奖励系统突破了监督学习的性能平台，在各测试集上获得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前强化学习在需要深度理解信息丰富图像和生成结构化输出的任务中应用不足，监督学习单独应用效果有限，需要有效的RL策略来奖励结构化输出。

Method: 提出多模态结构化强化学习(MSRL)，构建了包含300万实际图表-代码对的训练集，使用多粒度结构化奖励系统：文本层面的规则基础奖励验证细粒度代码细节，视觉层面的模型基础奖励通过渲染代码成图像并使用评估模型评估结构相似性，采用两阶段课程训练保证稳定性。

Result: MSRL方法显著突破了SFT的性能平台，在ChartMimic和ReachQA测试集上分别提升了6.2%和9.9%的高级指标，达到了与先进闭源模型竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 多模态结构化强化学习是解决图表到代码生成这类需要复杂理解的多模态任务的有效方法，通过结构化奖励系统可以有效突破监督学习的性能限制。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general
reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring
in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured
outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this
challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate
structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,
highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward
structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in
SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured
Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially
breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,
containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate
simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art
performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a
plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method
leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual
and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate
fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess
structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an
evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training
stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau,
improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA
benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced
closed-source models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: V2P方法通过抑制注意力机制和基于Fitts定律的高斯热图建模，解决了GUI元素定位中的背景干扰和中心边缘区分问题，在两个基准测试中分别达到92.3%和50.5%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GUI元素定位方法忽视空间交互不确定性和视觉语义层次结构，现有注意力方法存在背景区域干扰导致注意力漂移，以及均匀标注无法区分目标UI元素中心与边缘的问题。

Method: 提出Valley-to-Peak (V2P)方法：1) 抑制注意力机制减少对无关区域的关注；2) 基于Fitts定律将GUI交互建模为2D高斯热图，权重从中心向边缘递减，方差由目标大小决定。

Result: 在两个基准测试ScreenSpot-v2和ScreenSpot-Pro上分别达到92.3%和50.5%的性能表现，消融实验证实了各组件贡献。

Conclusion: V2P方法能有效隔离目标区域并让模型专注于UI元素最关键的点，在精确GUI定位任务中具有良好泛化能力。

Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI
agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,
neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.
Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:
(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the
desired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and
edges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how
humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the
Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background
distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes
the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For
the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired
approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight
gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution
follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.
Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to
concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by
V2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks
ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablations further confirm each component's
contribution, highlighting V2P's generalizability for precise GUI grounding
tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了在知识图谱查询中处理软约束的新方法Neural Query Reranker(NQR)，通过交互式示例学习来调整答案评分，同时保持原有查询结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱查询方法主要基于一阶逻辑，无法处理现实世界中普遍存在的模糊或上下文相关的软约束需求，如属性偏好或相关类别偏好。

Method: 提出Neural Query Reranker(NQR)模型，通过增量学习用户提供的偏好和非偏好实体示例，在不破坏原始查询答案的基础上调整评分。扩展现有QA基准生成包含软约束的数据集。

Result: 实验证明NQR能够有效捕捉软约束，同时保持稳健的查询回答性能。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了知识图谱查询处理软约束的空白，为处理现实世界中模糊和上下文相关的查询需求提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve
entities that are likely to be answers, which is particularly useful when such
answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges.
However, existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using
first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints
that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for
attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem
of query answering with soft constraints. We propose a Neural Query Reranker
(NQR) designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints
without disrupting the original answers to a query. NQR operates interactively,
refining answers based on incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred
entities. We extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft
constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that NQR can capture soft constraints
while maintaining robust query answering performance.

Motivation: LIME方法在数据稀缺环境下存在随机性和不稳定性问题，可能产生不真实的变体样本，导致代替模型无法准确近似原始模型的复杂决策边界

Method: 提出ITL-LIME框架，利用相关源域的真实实例进行迁移学习。通过聚类找到与目标实例最相似的源聚类原型，获取相关真实源实例，使用对比学习编码器作为权重机制，训练代替模型

Conclusion: ITL-LIME框架通过实例迁移学习有效解决了LIME在数据稀缺情况下的限制，为可解释人工智能提供了更稳定和可靠的解释方法

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), have advanced the
interpretability of black-box machine learning models by approximating their
behavior locally using interpretable surrogate models. However, LIME's inherent
randomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability
issues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data
scarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples
that deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may
fail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original
model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer
Learning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and
stability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance
transfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances
from a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target
domain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into
clusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random
perturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the
source cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These
are then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To
define a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based
encoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the
combined set based on their proximity to the target instance. Finally, these
weighted source and target instances are used to train the surrogate model for
explanation purposes.

Result: 研究发现情境知识图谱的特殊特性导致许多链接预测算法不适合此任务，表现不如简单基线方法。

Conclusion: 情境知识图谱需要专门设计的链接预测算法，现有通用方法在此领域效果有限。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs are used for various purposes, including business
applications, biomedical analyses, or digital twins in industry 4.0. In this
paper, we investigate knowledge graphs describing household actions, which are
beneficial for controlling household robots and analyzing video footage. In the
latter case, the information extracted from videos is notoriously incomplete,
and completing the knowledge graph for enhancing the situational picture is
essential. In this paper, we show that, while a standard link prediction
problem, situational knowledge graphs have special characteristics that render
many link prediction algorithms not fit for the job, and unable to outperform
even simple baselines.

Motivation: 第三方网站获取的简历往往不完整和不准确，需要与公司人才库中的简历进行重复检测来提升简历质量和丰富人才库，但由于简历文本的语义复杂性、结构异构性和信息不完整性，这一任务具有挑战性。

Result: 实验结果验证了MHSNet的有效性。

Conclusion: MHSNet能够有效解决简历重复检测中的挑战，提高第三方简历质量并丰富公司人才库。

Abstract: To maintain the company's talent pool, recruiters need to continuously search
for resumes from third-party websites (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed). However,
fetched resumes are often incomplete and inaccurate. To improve the quality of
third-party resumes and enrich the company's talent pool, it is essential to
conduct duplication detection between the fetched resumes and those already in
the company's talent pool. Such duplication detection is challenging due to the
semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness
of resume texts. To this end, we propose MHSNet, an multi-level identity
verification framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. With
the fine-tuned , Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) generates multi-level sparse and
dense representations for resumes, enabling the computation of corresponding
multi-level semantic similarities. Moreover, the state-aware Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) is employed in MHSNet to handle diverse incomplete resumes. Experimental
results verify the effectiveness of MHSNet

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results across various
tasks, yet their reasoning capabilities remain a fundamental challenge.
Developing AI systems with strong reasoning capabilities is regarded as a
crucial milestone in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and
has garnered considerable attention from both academia and industry. Various
techniques have been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs,
with neuro-symbolic approaches being a particularly promising way. This paper
comprehensively reviews recent developments in neuro-symbolic approaches for
enhancing LLM reasoning. We first present a formalization of reasoning tasks
and give a brief introduction to the neurosymbolic learning paradigm. Then, we
discuss neuro-symbolic methods for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs
from three perspectives: Symbolic->LLM, LLM->Symbolic, and LLM+Symbolic.
Finally, we discuss several key challenges and promising future directions. We
have also released a GitHub repository including papers and resources related

Conclusion: DeepLog提供了一个通用且高效的神经符号AI框架，通过声明式方法支持不同的代数结构和逻辑选择，实现了良好的泛化性和效率。

Abstract: We contribute a theoretical and operational framework for neurosymbolic AI
called DeepLog. DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for
neurosymbolic AI that make abstraction of commonly used representations and
computational mechanisms used in neurosymbolic AI. DeepLog can represent and
emulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems. It consists of two key
components. The first is the DeepLog language for specifying neurosymbolic
models and inference tasks. This language consists of an annotated neural
extension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of
logic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the
architecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated
at the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as
computational graphs. Together these two components are to be considered as a
neurosymbolic abstract machine, with the DeepLog language as the intermediate
level of abstraction and the circuits level as the computational one. DeepLog
is implemented in software, relies on the latest insights in implementing
algebraic circuits on GPUs, and is declarative in that it is easy to obtain
different neurosymbolic models by making different choices for the underlying
algebraic structures and logics. The generality and efficiency of the DeepLog
neurosymbolic machine is demonstrated through an experimental comparison
between 1) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, 2) between using logic in
the architecture or in the loss function, and 3) between a standalone CPU-based
implementation of a neurosymbolic AI system and a DeepLog GPU-based one.

*Minh Hoang Nguyen,Van Dai Do,Dung Nguyen,Thin Nguyen,Hung Le*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalPlan是一个两阶段框架，通过将显式结构因果推理集成到LLM规划过程中，解决了LLM智能体在协作任务中产生因果无效动作的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型智能体（尤其是较小的开源模型）在协作任务中经常产生因果无效或不连贯的动作，因为它们依赖表面相关性而非基于因果推理，这削弱了它们在动态环境中的协调和规划能力。

Method: 提出CausalPlan框架，核心是结构因果行动（SCA）模型，从智能体轨迹中学习因果图来捕捉先前行动和当前环境状态如何影响未来决策。该结构用于通过分配因果分数来指导行动选择，重新加权LLM生成的提议，或在需要时回退到因果基础的替代方案。

Result: 在Overcooked-AI基准测试中，使用四种不同规模的LLM（Gemma-7B、Llama-8B、Qwen-14B和Llama-70B）在五个多智能体协调任务上进行评估。实验结果显示CausalPlan持续减少无效动作，在AI-AI和人类-AI设置中都改善了协作性能，优于强化学习基线。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了因果驱动规划对于部署高效、可解释和可泛化的多智能体LLM系统的价值，无需对LLM本身进行微调即可将规划约束为干预一致的行为。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source
models-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative
tasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded
causal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of
coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge
with CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural
causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is
the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from
agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states
influence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action
selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting
them accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when
needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop,
CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without
requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the
Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four
LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B.
Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions
and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming
strong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of
causality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and
generalisable multi-agent LLM systems.

Motivation: 单一LLM在医疗决策中存在参数知识限制和静态训练语料的局限性，无法有效整合复杂的临床信息，需要多LLM协作来提升诊断性能。

Method: 两阶段框架：1）基于公开语料构建LLM专业能力表，动态选择最优医疗专家LLM；2）通过置信度融合和对抗验证整合多个专家的响应。

Result: 在三个公开MDM数据集上评估，EMRC优于最先进的单LLM和多LLM方法，在MMLU-Pro-Health数据集上达到74.45%准确率，比GPT-4-0613提升2.69%。

Conclusion: EMRC框架通过专家感知的智能体招募策略和智能体互补机制，有效利用了各LLM的专业能力，显著提升了医疗决策系统的诊断性能。

Abstract: Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial
domain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and
complicated clinical information. While recent advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited
by their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing
to robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we
propose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)
framework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates
in two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and
adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,
we use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for
capturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical
department categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the
subsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert
agents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,
we employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence
scores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial
validation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on
three public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC
outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior
diagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC
achieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the
best-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent
complementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.

Method: 将观察到的实例化视为潜在语言的样本，使用概率上下文自然法(PCFG)来生成新的相似项。方法不仅模仿成功的历史实例化，还通过可选地翻转学习到的项概率来探索多样性。

Result: 该方法能够在量证论证中平衡利用(模仿成功经验)和探索(寻找新的可行解)两个方面，提高了SMT求解器处理量化公式的效果。

Conclusion: 通过将概率语言模型与动态学习相结合，本文提出的方法为SMT求解器处理量化公式提供了一种有效的新途径，能够更好地结合现有各种实例化技术的优点。

Abstract: Quantified formulas pose a significant challenge for Satisfiability Modulo
Theories (SMT) solvers due to their inherent undecidability. Existing
instantiation techniques, such as e-matching, syntax-guided, model-based,
conflict-based, and enumerative methods, often complement each other. This
paper introduces a novel instantiation approach that dynamically learns from
these techniques during solving. By treating observed instantiations as samples
from a latent language, we use probabilistic context-free grammars to generate
new, similar terms. Our method not only mimics successful past instantiations
but also explores diversity by optionally inverting learned term probabilities,
aiming to balance exploitation and exploration in quantifier reasoning.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has been widely applied in
recent years. However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a
single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream
tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has
become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a
comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG
systems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both
theoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical
analysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from
the perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have
explored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels.
We carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and
Agentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to
solve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating
multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline
level or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on
the multi-RAG system ensemble.

Abstract: LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing
generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the
tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of
three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the
domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python
program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one
strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the
strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect
generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in
the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence
allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the
generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase
with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the
observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to
produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on
17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and
never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,
our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the
respective instance generator.

TL;DR: TS-Agent是一个模块化代理框架，用于自动化金融时间序列建模工作流，通过三阶段决策过程（模型选择、代码优化、微调）实现比现有AutoML和代理基线更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融时间序列数据建模面临高性能、可解释性和可审计性的挑战，现有AutoML框架缺乏对领域特定需求和动态目标的适应性，而LLM代理系统提供了更灵活的工作流自动化路径。

Method: 设计模块化代理框架，包含规划代理和结构化知识库，通过三阶段迭代决策过程：模型选择、代码优化和微调，利用上下文推理和实验反馈进行指导。

Result: 在多种金融预测和合成数据生成任务上的实证评估表明，TS-Agent在准确性、鲁棒性和决策可追溯性方面持续优于最先进的AutoML和代理基线。

Conclusion: TS-Agent框架支持自适应学习、鲁棒调试和透明审计，满足了金融服务等高风险环境的关键需求，为时间序列建模提供了有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet
building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major
challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline
model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to
domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language
Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory
management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible
workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular
agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling
workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a
structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection,
code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and
experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped
with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement
strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and
reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning,
robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes
environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse
financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that
\textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic
baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.

TL;DR: 研究发现AI驱动的供应链代理存在'合作悖论'：理论上更优的协作型AI代理表现反而比非AI基线更差，原因是库存囤积导致系统崩溃。最终提出了结合高层策略制定和低层执行协议的双层框架来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI自主代理在经济环境中的战略行为，特别是在多级供应链这种容易出现牛鞭效应等不稳定性的系统中，探索生成式AI代理的协作动态。

Method: 使用基于大语言模型的生成式AI代理在受控供应链模拟中进行计算实验，设计对比VMI原则的协作AI代理与非AI基线的表现。

Result: 发现了'合作悖论'现象，协作AI代理表现更差；识别出库存囤积的操作缺陷；开发了结合高层AI策略制定和低层协作执行的双层弹性框架。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了协作AI代理的涌现行为特征，为设计稳定有效的AI驱动商业分析系统提供了重要见解和蓝图。

Abstract: The rise of autonomous, AI-driven agents in economic settings raises critical
questions about their emergent strategic behavior. This paper investigates
these dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a
system famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct
computational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate
their behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the "collaboration
paradox": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior
collaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)
principles, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this
paradox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving
the system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis
of two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to
establish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution
protocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our
final framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate,
evaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices. The work
provides a crucial insight into the emergent behaviors of collaborative AI
agents and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems
for business analytics.

Method: 提出一个框架，通过精细调整和定制各类大语言模型，生成PyChrono模拟脚本，包括从单摆到复杂车辆-变形地形模拟

Result: 生成的脚本虽然不完美，但能作为良好的起点，模型还能回答API问题和推荐建模方法，质量有量化提升

Conclusion: 该框架具有普适性，可扩展到其他模拟工具领域，有效降低专业模拟工具的使用门槛

Abstract: This contribution is concerned with the following issue: can pretrained large
language models (LLMs) be refined and customized to the point where they become
virtual assistants helping experts with the effective use of a simulation tool?
In this case study, the ``simulation tool'' considered is PyChrono, an open
source multi-physics dynamics engine for multibody systems. We present a
framework for refining and customizing both open- and closed-source LLMs to
harness the power of AI in generating scripts that perform PyChrono virtual
experiments. We refine and customize several classes of LLMs through a process
that leads to a quantifiable improvement in the quality of the generated
PyChrono simulation scripts. These scripts can range from simple
single-pendulum simulations to complex virtual experiments involving full
vehicles on deformable terrain. While the generated scripts are rarely perfect,
they often serve as strong starting points for the user to modify and improve
on. Additionally, the LLM can answer specific API questions about the
simulator, or recommend modeling approaches. The framework discussed is general
and can be applied to lower the entry barrier for simulation tools associated
with other application domains.

Motivation: LRS问题是一个NP难组合优化问题，在生物信息学特别是基因组重组中具有重要意义，需要高效的求解算法

Method: 采用偏向随机键道因算法(BRKGA)，重点关注个体评估的计算效率，将灰度值向量转换为有效解。同时开发了Max-Min蚂蚁系统和使用CPLEX整数规划求解器进行对比

Result: 计算结果显示BRKGA在LRS问题上达到了当前最先进水平，在计算效率和解的质量方面都表现优异

Conclusion: BRKGA是解决LRS问题的有效方法，但对于基于大字母表的输入字符串，算法仍有改进的潜力和空间

Abstract: The longest run subsequence (LRS) problem is an NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem belonging to the class of subsequence problems from
bioinformatics. In particular, the problem plays a role in genome reassembly.
In this paper, we present a solution to the LRS problem using a Biased Random
Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA). Our approach places particular focus on the
computational efficiency of evaluating individuals, which involves converting
vectors of gray values into valid solutions to the problem. For comparison
purposes, a Max-Min Ant System is developed and implemented. This is in
addition to the application of the integer linear programming solver CPLEX for
solving all considered problem instances. The computation results show that the
proposed BRKGA is currently a state-of-the-art technique for the LRS problem.
Nevertheless, the results also show that there is room for improvement,
especially in the context of input strings based on large alphabet sizes.

Motivation: 解决机器代理在人类桌面环境中操作时的不匹配问题，通过统一API调用和GUI交互来提升桌面自动化能力。

Method: 采用分布式RL基础设施协调数千个并行虚拟桌面环境进行大规模在线RL训练，并提出Entropulse训练策略（RL与监督微调交替）来缓解熵崩溃问题。

Conclusion: ComputerRL框架通过创新的API-GUI范式和可扩展的训练基础设施，成功提升了桌面自动化代理的性能，为自主桌面智能提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce ComputerRL, a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that
enables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully. ComputerRL
features the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct
GUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and
human-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial
for improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks, yet remains
challenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability in extended
training. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL
infrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop
environments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose
Entropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended
training runs. We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and
Qwen2.5-14B, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B
based on GLM-4-9B-0414 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.1%,
demonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop
automation. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building AutoGLM (Liu et

Motivation: 高保真个性化人体肌肉骨骼模型对于人机交互系统仿真和安全验证至关重要，但传统方法难以直接测量内部生物力学变量，特别是关节扭矩。

Method: 使用可微分肌肉骨骼模型（Diff-MSM），通过自动微分技术从可测量的肌肉激活到可观察的运动进行端到端参数识别，无需测量内部关节扭矩。

Result: 在广泛比较仿真中，该方法显著优于最先进的基线方法，肌肉参数估计误差低至0.05%（初始猜测从均值为真实值、标准差为真实值10%的正态分布中采样）。

Conclusion: Diff-MSM参数识别技术不仅可用于肌肉骨骼建模和仿真，还有望在肌肉健康监测、康复和运动科学等领域实现新的应用。

Abstract: High-fidelity personalized human musculoskeletal models are crucial for
simulating realistic behavior of physically coupled human-robot interactive
systems and verifying their safety-critical applications in simulations before
actual deployment, such as human-robot co-transportation and rehabilitation
through robotic exoskeletons. Identifying subject-specific Hill-type muscle
model parameters and bone dynamic parameters is essential for a personalized
musculoskeletal model, but very challenging due to the difficulty of measuring
the internal biomechanical variables in vivo directly, especially the joint
torques. In this paper, we propose using Differentiable MusculoSkeletal Model
(Diff-MSM) to simultaneously identify its muscle and bone parameters with an
end-to-end automatic differentiation technique differentiating from the
measurable muscle activation, through the joint torque, to the resulting
observable motion without the need to measure the internal joint torques.
Through extensive comparative simulations, the results manifested that our
proposed method significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art baseline
methods, especially in terms of accurate estimation of the muscle parameters
(i.e., initial guess sampled from a normal distribution with the mean being the
ground truth and the standard deviation being 10% of the ground truth could end
up with an average of the percentage errors of the estimated values as low as
0.05%). In addition to human musculoskeletal modeling and simulation, the new
parameter identification technique with the Diff-MSM has great potential to
enable new applications in muscle health monitoring, rehabilitation, and sports
science.

Abstract: We build a mobile surveillance robot that streams video in real time and
responds to speech so a user can monitor and steer it from a phone or browser.
The system uses two Raspberry Pi 4 units: a front unit on a differential drive
base with camera, mic, and speaker, and a central unit that serves the live
feed and runs perception. Video is sent with FFmpeg. Objects in the scene are
detected using YOLOv3 to support navigation and event awareness. For voice
interaction, we use Python libraries for speech recognition, multilingual
translation, and text-to-speech, so the robot can take spoken commands and read
back responses in the requested language. A Kinect RGB-D sensor provides visual
input and obstacle cues. In indoor tests the robot detects common objects at
interactive frame rates on CPU, recognises commands reliably, and translates
them to actions without manual control. The design relies on off-the-shelf
hardware and open software, making it easy to reproduce. We discuss limits and
practical extensions, including sensor fusion with ultrasonic range data, GPU
acceleration, and adding face and text recognition.

Motivation: 解决复杂动力学环境下实时规划问题，传统Hybrid A*的网格分辨率选择困难：太粗可能导致失败，太细则导致过度扩展和规划缓慢

Method: 提出增量式广义混合A*框架，采用动态顶点扩展组织机制，避免刚性剪枝，可证明匹配或优于传统Hybrid A*

Result: 在类车机器人道路和越野规划中，IGHA*变体比优化版Hybrid A*减少6倍扩展次数；在高保真模拟器中优于HA*M；在仿真和小型越野车上实现实时性能

Conclusion: IGHA*能够在复杂动力学下实现快速鲁棒的实时规划，为自动驾驶和空中车辆等应用提供高效的大规模树搜索解决方案

Abstract: We address the problem of efficiently organizing search over very large
trees, which arises in many applications ranging from autonomous driving to
aerial vehicles. Here, we are motivated by off-road autonomy, where real-time
planning is essential. Classical approaches use graphs of motion primitives and
exploit dominance to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and prune expansions
efficiently. However, for complex dynamics, repeatedly solving two-point
boundary-value problems makes graph construction too slow for fast kinodynamic
planning. Hybrid A* (HA*) addressed this challenge by searching over a tree of
motion primitives and introducing approximate pruning using a grid-based
dominance check. However, choosing the grid resolution is difficult: too coarse
risks failure, while too fine leads to excessive expansions and slow planning.
We propose Incremental Generalized Hybrid A* (IGHA*), an anytime tree-search
framework that dynamically organizes vertex expansions without rigid pruning.
IGHA* provably matches or outperforms HA*. For both on-road kinematic and
off-road kinodynamic planning queries for a car-like robot, variants of IGHA*
use 6x fewer expansions to the best solution compared to an optimized version
of HA*. In simulated off-road experiments in a high fidelity simulator, IGHA*
outperforms HA*M when both are used in the loop with a model predictive
controller. We demonstrate real-time performance both in simulation and on a
small-scale off-road vehicle, enabling fast, robust planning under complex
dynamics. Code: https://github.com/personalrobotics/IGHAStar

Motivation: 双足行走任务与动作规划问题包含非凸约束（如运动学可达性和脚步旋转），使得混合整数规划问题计算复杂度极高，需要更高效的解法

Method: 采用Benders分解法，将问题分解为主问题（生成符合任务规范的计划）和一系列子问题（进行运动学和动力学可行性检查），通过迭代切割平面技术求解

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在解决非线性约束的优化问题时，比其他算法更快地完成规划

Conclusion: Benders分解法能够有效处理双足行走中的复杂混合整数规划问题，通过问题分解和迭代求解提高了计算效率

Abstract: Task and motion planning under Signal Temporal Logic constraints is known to
be NP-hard. A common class of approaches formulates these hybrid problems,
which involve discrete task scheduling and continuous motion planning, as
mixed-integer programs (MIP). However, in applications for bipedal locomotion,
introduction of non-convex constraints such as kinematic reachability and
footstep rotation exacerbates the computational complexity of MIPs. In this
work, we present a method based on Benders Decomposition to address scenarios
where solving the entire monolithic optimization problem is prohibitively
intractable. Benders Decomposition proposes an iterative cutting-plane
technique that partitions the problem into a master problem to prototype a plan
that meets the task specification, and a series of subproblems for kinematics
and dynamics feasibility checks. Our experiments demonstrate that this method
achieves faster planning compared to alternative algorithms for solving the
resulting optimization program with nonlinear constraints.

Conclusion: 假想标签方法为提升通用机器人的语言理解和指令遵循能力提供了一种有效的数据增帿途径，能够在不需额外数据收集的情况下显著改善模型性能

Abstract: Generalist robots should be able to understand and follow user instructions,
but current vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with following
fine-grained commands despite providing a powerful architecture for mapping
open-vocabulary natural language instructions to robot actions. One cause for
this is a lack of semantic diversity and language grounding in existing robot
datasets and, specifically, a lack of fine-grained task diversity for similar
observations. To address this, we present a novel method to augment existing
robot datasets by leveraging vision language models to create counterfactual
labels. Our method improves the language-following capabilities of VLAs by
increasing the diversity and granularity of language grounding for robot
datasets by generating counterfactual language and actions. We evaluate the
resulting model's ability to follow language instructions, ranging from simple
object-centric commands to complex referential tasks, by conducting visual
language navigation experiments in 3 different indoor and outdoor environments.
Our experiments demonstrate that counterfactual relabeling, without any
additional data collection, significantly improves instruction-following in VLA
policies, making them competitive with state-of-the-art methods and increasing
success rate by 27% on navigation tasks.

Conclusion: 该研究为AWOISV提供了一种有效的控制方案，能够在各种机动模式下实现精确的位置和方向控制，具有良好的应用前景

Abstract: An all-wheel omni-directional independent steering vehicle (AWOISV) is a
specialized all-wheel independent steering vehicle with each wheel capable of
steering up to 90{\deg}, enabling unique maneuvers like yaw and diagonal
movement. This paper introduces a theoretical steering radius angle and
sideslip angle (\( \theta_R \)-\(\beta_R \)) representation, based on the
position of the instantaneous center of rotation relative to the wheel rotation
center, defining the motion modes and switching criteria for AWOISVs. A
generalized \( v\)-\(\beta\)-\(r \) dynamic model is developed with forward
velocity \(v\), sideslip angle \(\beta\), and yaw rate \(r\) as states, and
\(\theta_R\) and \(\beta_R\) as control inputs. This model decouples
longitudinal and lateral motions into forward and rotational motions, allowing
seamless transitions across all motion modes under specific conditions. A
filtered tube-based linear time-varying MPC (FT-LTVMPC) strategy is proposed,
achieving simultaneous tracking of lateral position and arbitrary heading
angles, with robustness to model inaccuracies and parameter uncertainties.
Co-simulation and hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiments confirm that FT-LTVMPC
enables high-precision control of both position and heading while ensuring
excellent real-time performance.

Abstract: The ``Last Mile Challenge'' has long been considered an important, yet
unsolved, challenge for autonomous vehicles, public service robots, and
delivery robots. A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to
navigate constrained and cluttered environments (e.g., doorways, hallways,
corridor intersections), often while competing for space with other robots and
humans. We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). SMGs
are tightly coupled, high-agency interactions that arise within general
multi-robot navigation (MRN) scenarios. They are identified through certain
distinct characteristics and require specialized metrics to evaluate them.
Traditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs,
which has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers (navigation methods
specialized to navigate in SMGs), which has flourished in recent years.
However, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on
centralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation,
etc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These
assumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described
informally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for
comparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners
to find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such ad-hoc
representation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers wanting
to start research in this area. SMG navigation research requires its own
taxonomy, definitions, and evaluation protocols to guide effective research
moving forward. This survey is the first to catalog SMG solvers using a
well-defined and unified taxonomy and to classify existing methods accordingly.

Result: 基准测试和真实世界实验证明了该方法的有效性，集成到最先进的SLAM系统中验证了其鲁棒性和效率

Conclusion: 利用轨迹先验约束可以有效拒绝重复环境中的错误闭环检测，提高SLAM系统的可靠性

Abstract: Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes,
achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely
detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive
environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity.
Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false
positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly
focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge
of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter,
we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the
historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in
challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used
to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory
is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the
trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to
determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and
real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify
its robustness and efficiency. Our source code and self-collected dataset are
available at https://github.com/jarvisyjw/ROVER.

TL;DR: 一种统一的层次模型预测控制方法，能够适配不同槍形的模块化操纵器，无需深度调整控制器参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模块化操纵器在不同槍形下的控制问题，提供一种统一的控制框架以适配多种配置，避免每次都需要重新调整控制器参数。

Method: 采用两层模型预测控制（H-MPC）结构：高层MPC预测未来状态和提供轨迹信息，低层MPC基于高层信息精炼控制动作。低层MPC还包含二次线性化，利用高层预测信息捕捉运动学模型的二阶泰勒展开信息。

Result: 通过在不同操纵器槍形下进行广泛评估，并在真实场景中执行摘放任务，验证了控制策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 该层次控制结构能够集成运动学约束，确保平滑的关节空间轨迹，甚至在奇异配置附近也能稳定工作。方法在保持线性控制模型简单性的同时提高了运动学表示的准确性，从而提升了整体控制精度和可靠性。

Abstract: This work proposes a unified Hierarchical Model Predictive Control (H-MPC)
for modular manipulators across various morphologies, as the controller can
adapt to different configurations to execute the given task without extensive
parameter tuning in the controller. The H-MPC divides the control process into
two levels: a high-level MPC and a low-level MPC. The high-level MPC predicts
future states and provides trajectory information, while the low-level MPC
refines control actions by updating the predictive model based on this
high-level information. This hierarchical structure allows for the integration
of kinematic constraints and ensures smooth joint-space trajectories, even near
singular configurations. Moreover, the low-level MPC incorporates secondary
linearization by leveraging predictive information from the high-level MPC,
effectively capturing the second-order Taylor expansion information of the
kinematic model while still maintaining a linearized model formulation. This
approach not only preserves the simplicity of a linear control model but also
enhances the accuracy of the kinematic representation, thereby improving
overall control precision and reliability. To validate the effectiveness of the
control policy, we conduct extensive evaluations across different manipulator
morphologies and demonstrate the execution of pick-and-place tasks in
real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a control framework designed to enhance the stability and
robustness of legged robots in the presence of uncertainties, including model
uncertainties, external disturbances, and faults. The framework enables the
full-state feedback estimator to estimate and compensate for uncertainties in
whole-body dynamics of the legged robots. First, we propose a novel moving
horizon extended state observer (MH-ESO) to estimate uncertainties and mitigate
noise in legged systems, which can be integrated into the framework for
disturbance compensation. Second, we introduce a three-level whole-body
disturbance rejection control framework (T-WB-DRC). Unlike the previous
two-level approach, this three-level framework considers both the plan based on
whole-body dynamics without uncertainties and the plan based on dynamics with
uncertainties, significantly improving payload transportation, external
disturbance rejection, and fault tolerance. Third, simulations of both humanoid
and quadruped robots in the Gazebo simulator demonstrate the effectiveness and
versatility of T-WB-DRC. Finally, extensive experimental trials on a quadruped
robot validate the robustness and stability of the system when using T-WB-DRC
under various disturbance conditions.

Motivation: 人类能够通过观察一次就模仿工具操作行为，并能轻松将技能迁移到不同工具上执行功能等效任务，而当前机器人难以达到这种泛化水平。关键挑战在于建立功能级对应关系，考虑功能相似工具之间的显著几何差异

Method: 提出MimicFunc框架，使用功能帧（function-centric local coordinate frame）建立功能对应关系，通过基于关键点的抽象构建功能中心局部坐标系

Result: 实验证明MimicFunc能有效让机器人从单个人类RGB-D视频中泛化技能，操作新工具执行功能等效任务。利用其一次性泛化能力，生成的轨迹可用于训练视觉运动策略，无需为新颖对象收集劳动密集的遥操作数据

Conclusion: MimicFunc为解决工具操作技能模仿中的功能级对应问题提供了有效解决方案，实现了从人类视频到机器人操作的一次性技能迁移和泛化

Abstract: Imitating tool manipulation from human videos offers an intuitive approach to
teaching robots, while also providing a promising and scalable alternative to
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for visuomotor policy learning.
While humans can mimic tool manipulation behavior by observing others perform a
task just once and effortlessly transfer the skill to diverse tools for
functionally equivalent tasks, current robots struggle to achieve this level of
generalization. A key challenge lies in establishing function-level
correspondences, considering the significant geometric variations among
functionally similar tools, referred to as intra-function variations. To
address this challenge, we propose MimicFunc, a framework that establishes
functional correspondences with function frame, a function-centric local
coordinate frame constructed with keypoint-based abstraction, for imitating
tool manipulation skills. Experiments demonstrate that MimicFunc effectively
enables the robot to generalize the skill from a single RGB-D human video to
manipulating novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks. Furthermore,
leveraging MimicFunc's one-shot generalization capability, the generated
rollouts can be used to train visuomotor policies without requiring
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for novel objects. Our code and
video are available at https://sites.google.com/view/mimicfunc.

TL;DR: 研究调查了自主清扫机器人类型和运动模式对分心和未分心行人移动行为的影响，发现机器人大小和运动模式比行人是否分心更能影响行人的侧向调整行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主机器人在公共空间的普及，与普通人的突发性遇见更加常见，需要研究如何通过通信策略提高透明度和减少危险情况。当前研究对分心行人在自主机器人身边的行为调查不足。

Method: 在现场环境中，对N=498名未知情的行人进行视频录制，让他们穿迈两个正在工作的自主清扫机器人。约8%行人在使用手机分心。比较了两种机器人类型（大型扫地机器人和小型清洗机器人）和两种运动模式（偏移矩形模式和圆形模式）的影响。

Result: 分心和未分心行人在机器人身边的移动行为没有显著差异。相比小型清洗机器人和圆形运动模式，大型扫地机器人和偏移矩形运动模式明显增加了行人的侧向调整次数。偏移矩形模式还导致更多的近距离侧向调整。不同机器类型下，运动模式导致侧向调整距离的差异。

Conclusion: 研究为公共空间中行人在自主清扫机器人身边的移动行为提供了初步见解，贡献于HRI人机交互研究领域。机器人的物理特征（大小）和运动模式比行人是否分心更能影响行人的规避行为。

Abstract: As autonomous robots become more common in public spaces, spontaneous
encounters with laypersons are more frequent. For this, robots need to be
equipped with communication strategies that enhance momentary transparency and
reduce the probability of critical situations. Adapting these robotic
strategies requires consideration of robot movements, environmental conditions,
and user characteristics and states. While numerous studies have investigated
the impact of distraction on pedestrians' movement behavior, limited research
has examined this behavior in the presence of autonomous robots. This research
addresses the impact of robot type and robot movement pattern on distracted and
undistracted pedestrians' movement behavior. In a field setting, unaware
pedestrians were videotaped while moving past two working, autonomous cleaning
robots. Out of N=498 observed pedestrians, approximately 8% were distracted by
smartphones. Distracted and undistracted pedestrians did not exhibit
significant differences in their movement behaviors around the robots. Instead,
both the larger sweeping robot and the offset rectangular movement pattern
significantly increased the number of lateral adaptations compared to the
smaller cleaning robot and the circular movement pattern. The offset
rectangular movement pattern also led to significantly more close lateral
adaptations. Depending on the robot type, the movement patterns led to
differences in the distances of lateral adaptations. The study provides initial
insights into pedestrian movement behavior around an autonomous cleaning robot
in public spaces, contributing to the growing field of HRI research.

Conclusion: DIPPeR机器人提供了一种高效、精确的爆破孔自主检测方案，为开采矿山业提供了重要的地质数据获取手段，有力降低物料处理成本

Abstract: In open-pit mining, holes are drilled into the surface of the excavation site
and detonated with explosives to facilitate digging. These blast holes need to
be inspected internally for investigation of downhole material types and
properties. Knowing these properties can lead to significant savings in
material handling costs in downstream processes. Manual hole inspection is slow
and expensive, with major limitations in revealing the geometric and geological
properties of the holes and their contents. This has been the motivation for
the development of our autonomous mine-site inspection robot - "DIPPeR". In
this paper, the automation aspect of the project is explained. We present a
robust blast hole seeking and detection framework that enables target-based
navigation and accurate down-hole sensor positioning. The pipeline first
processes point-cloud data collected by the on-board LiDAR sensors, extracting
the cone-shaped volume of drill-waste above the ground. By projecting the 3D
cone points into a virtual depth image, segmentation is achieved in the 2D
domain, yielding a circular hole at the image centre and a collared cone face.
We then identify the hole centre using a robust detection module while
suppressing non-maximum candidates, ensuring precise sensor placement for
down-hole inspection and avoiding collisions with the cavity wall. To enable
autonomous hole-seeking, the pipeline automatically adjusts its projection
parameters during robot navigation to account for variations in point sparsity
and hole opening size, ensuring a consistent hole appearance in 2D images. This
allows continuous tracking of the target hole as the robot approaches the goal
point. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our navigation and perception system
in both high-fidelity simulation environments and on-site field tests. A
demonstration video is available at

TL;DR: 基于深度Koopman算子的数据驱动控制框架，通过线性化四旋翼非线性动力学实现高效的模型预测控制，在追踪精度和计算效率方面都显著优于传统非线性MPC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 四旋翼系统的非线性动力学使得传统非线性MPC计算复杂度高，难以满足嵌入式飞行控制的实时要求。需要一种新的控制框架来绕过非线性性并保持高性能。

Method: 结合深度Koopman算子和模型预测控制(MPC)。通过飞行数据训练深度Koopman算子，构建高维潜在表征，在该空间中将非线性动力学近似为线性模型，然后应用MPC进行控制优化。

Result: 通过轨迹跟随和点稳定数值实验验证，方法在追踪精度方面显著优于传统非线性MPC，同时计算时间显著降低。

Conclusion: Koopman基于学习方法能够处理复杂的四旋翼动力学，同时满足嵌入式飞行控制的实时要求，为高性能飞行控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven control framework for quadrotor systems
that integrates a deep Koopman operator with model predictive control (DK-MPC).
The deep Koopman operator is trained on sampled flight data to construct a
high-dimensional latent representation in which the nonlinear quadrotor
dynamics are approximated by linear models. This linearization enables the
application of MPC to efficiently optimize control actions over a finite
prediction horizon, ensuring accurate trajectory tracking and stabilization.
The proposed DK-MPC approach is validated through a series of
trajectory-following and point-stabilization numerical experiments, where it
demonstrates superior tracking accuracy and significantly lower computation
time compared to conventional nonlinear MPC. These results highlight the
potential of Koopman-based learning methods to handle complex quadrotor
dynamics while meeting the real-time requirements of embedded flight control.
Future work will focus on extending the framework to more agile flight
scenarios and improving robustness against external disturbances.

Motivation: 强化学习在机器人操作中存在数据需求大、依赖MDP假设的限制，而决策Transformer在多机器人操纵领域应用不充分

Method: 层次架构：神经-符号计划器生成高级符号子目标，目标条件决策transformer进行低级序列决策

Result: 在零样本和少样本场景中评估性能，是首个探索DT技术在多机器人操纵的工作

Conclusion: SGDT框架实现了结构化、可解释和可推广的复杂多机器人协作决策

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential in robotic
operations. However, its data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov
Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit its practical deployment in real-world
scenarios involving complex dynamics and long-term temporal dependencies, such
as multi-robot manipulation. Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a
promising offline alternative by leveraging causal transformers for sequence
modeling in RL tasks. However, their applications to multi-robot manipulations
still remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework,
Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer (SGDT), which integrates a
neuro-symbolic mechanism with a causal transformer to enable deployable
multi-robot collaboration. In the proposed SGDT framework, a neuro-symbolic
planner generates a high-level task-oriented plan composed of symbolic
subgoals. Guided by these subgoals, a goal-conditioned decision transformer
(GCDT) performs low-level sequential decision-making for multi-robot
manipulation. This hierarchical architecture enables structured, interpretable,
and generalizable decision making in complex multi-robot collaboration tasks.
We evaluate the performance of SGDT across a range of task scenarios, including
zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
explore DT-based technology for multi-robot manipulation.

Motivation: 现有驾驶风格识别系统主要依靠低级传感器特征，忽视了人类专家的丰富语义推理能力，导致算法分类与专家判断之间的对齐问题

Method: 首先开发DriBehavGPT模块生成自然语言驾驶行为描述，通过文本嵌入和降维转换为机器学习可处理表示，然后作为特权信息集成到SVM+进行训练

Result: 在多种实际驾驶场景中，SPI增强框架显著超越传统方法，F1分数提升7.6%(跟车)和7.9%(变道)，而推理仅需传感器数据

Conclusion: 语义行为表示在提高识别准确性方面发挥关键作用，同时推进了可解释性、以人为本的驾驶系统的发展

Abstract: Existing driving style recognition systems largely depend on low-level
sensor-derived features for training, neglecting the rich semantic reasoning
capability inherent to human experts. This discrepancy results in a fundamental
misalignment between algorithmic classifications and expert judgments. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that integrates Semantic
Privileged Information (SPI) derived from large language models (LLMs) to align
recognition outcomes with human-interpretable reasoning. First, we introduce
DriBehavGPT, an interactive LLM-based module that generates natural-language
descriptions of driving behaviors. These descriptions are then encoded into
machine learning-compatible representations via text embedding and
dimensionality reduction. Finally, we incorporate them as privileged
information into Support Vector Machine Plus (SVM+) for training, enabling the
model to approximate human-like interpretation patterns. Experiments across
diverse real-world driving scenarios demonstrate that our SPI-enhanced
framework outperforms conventional methods, achieving F1-score improvements of
7.6% (car-following) and 7.9% (lane-changing). Importantly, SPI is exclusively
used during training, while inference relies solely on sensor data, ensuring
computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. These results
highlight the pivotal role of semantic behavioral representations in improving
recognition accuracy while advancing interpretable, human-centric driving
systems.

Abstract: As robots get more integrated into human environments, fostering
trustworthiness in embodied robotic agents becomes paramount for an effective
and safe human-robot interaction (HRI). To achieve that, HRI applications must
promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and avoid misplaced trust or
overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical concerns. To achieve that,
HRI applications must promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and
avoid misplaced trust or overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical
concerns. In this position paper, we outline an interaction-based framework for
building trust through mutual understanding between humans and robots. We
emphasize two main pillars: human awareness and transparency, referring to the
robot ability to interpret human actions accurately and to clearly communicate
its intentions and goals, respectively. By integrating these two pillars,
robots can behave in a manner that aligns with human expectations and needs
while providing their human partners with both comprehension and control over
their actions. We also introduce four components that we think are important
for bridging the gap between a human-perceived sense of trust and a robot true
capabilities.

Abstract: The Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) community often highlights the social
context of an interaction as a key consideration when designing, implementing,
and evaluating robot behavior. Unfortunately, researchers use the term "social
context" in varied ways. This can lead to miscommunication, making it
challenging to draw connections between related work on understanding and
modeling the social contexts of human-robot interactions. To address this gap,
we survey the HRI literature for existing definitions and uses of the term
"social context". Then, we propose a conceptual model for describing the social
context of a human-robot interaction. We apply this model to existing work, and
we discuss a range of attributes of social contexts that can help researchers
plan for interactions, develop behavior models for robots, and gain insights
after interactions have taken place. We conclude with a discussion of open
research questions in relation to understanding and modeling the social
contexts of human-robot interactions.

Motivation: 解决具身AI中的'seeing-to-doing gap'问题，该问题源于数据稀缺和体现异质性，需要一种统一的中间表示来连接高级视觉语言理解和低级动作原语。

Conclusion: 指向中心表示与RFT训练范式相结合，为缩小机器人感知-行动差距提供了有效且可泛化的途径。

Abstract: Generalization in embodied AI is hindered by the "seeing-to-doing gap," which
stems from data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity. To address this, we
pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate
representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge
high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We
introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed
for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and
general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale
dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing
capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced
Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design.
Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and
pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot
generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5%
across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning,
representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model
exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows
that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm,
offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action

Abstract: Realizing generalizable dynamic object manipulation is important for
enhancing manufacturing efficiency, as it eliminates specialized engineering
for various scenarios. To this end, imitation learning emerges as a promising
paradigm, leveraging expert demonstrations to teach a policy manipulation
skills. Although the generalization of an imitation learning policy can be
improved by increasing demonstrations, demonstration collection is
labor-intensive. To address this problem, this paper investigates whether
strong generalization in dynamic object manipulation is achievable with only a
few demonstrations. Specifically, we develop an entropy-based theoretical
framework to quantify the optimization of imitation learning. Based on this
framework, we propose a system named Generalizable Entropy-based Manipulation
(GEM). Extensive experiments in simulated and real tasks demonstrate that GEM
can generalize across diverse environment backgrounds, robot embodiments,
motion dynamics, and object geometries. Notably, GEM has been deployed in a
real canteen for tableware collection. Without any in-scene demonstration, it
achieves a success rate of over 97% across more than 10,000 operations.

Abstract: Early detection and rapid intervention of lung cancer are crucial.
Nonetheless, ensuring an accurate diagnosis is challenging, as physicians'
ability to interpret chest X-rays varies significantly depending on their
experience and degree of fatigue. Although medical AI has been rapidly
advancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains
limited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally
stems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis,
physicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In
contrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target
lesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical
AI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to
diagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning
Policy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the
physicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information.
We used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou
University Hospital. The proposed model attained 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a
10% enhancement in sensitivity compared to the baseline model while also
decreasing entropy as a measure of uncertainty by 0.2.
