The proposed approach systematically constructs screw-theoretic PDE models for individual flexible links and rigorously enforces holonomic joint constraints through interaction forces. The dynamics of each link are formulated using a set of dual screws expressed in body-fixed coordinates: one describing the motion of the body-fixed frame relative to the inertial frame, a second relating the body-fixed frame to the undeformed configuration, and a third capturing elastic deformations. By expressing the system energy and applying variational principles, the governing dynamics of each link had been previously derived in a unified manner. Synthesizing the individual link models yields an infinitely scalable multibody representation capable of capturing both local (subsystem-level) and global (system-level) dynamics. The framework explicitly recovers all dynamic states, including the motion of each body-fixed frame and the distributed deformation fields of the flexible links. For computational tractability and mathematical rigor, the resulting governing equations are formulated as a semi-explicit index-1 differential-algebraic system. Furthermore, by applying separation of variables, the PDE model is recast as an abstract Cauchy problem, and well-posedness of the resulting system is established."}

The model augments the kinematic chain with virtual joints for each modeled effect and realizes the identification using Gauss-Newton optimization with analytic gradients. Fisher information spectra show that the estimation is well-conditioned and the parameterization near-minimal, whereas systematic temporal cross-validation and model ablations demonstrate robustness of the model identification. The resulting model is very accurate and its identification robust, achieving a mean position error of 26.8 $μm$ on a KUKA KR30 industrial robot compared to 102.3 $μm$ for purely geometric calibration."}

However, writing style can be difficult to distill into a single prompt, and LoRA fine-tuning requires computationally intensive training and infrastructure. We investigate a possible lightweight alternative: steering a frozen LLM with n-gram style priors injected in logit space at decoding time. We train an n-gram model on stylistically distinct corpora -- including Don Quixote, CNN/DailyMail news headlines, and arXiv abstracts -- constructing an interpolated 1-to-3-gram prior over next-token probabilities. During generation we modify the LLM's logits by adding a weighted sum of style log-probabilities from each n-gram order that matches the current context, scaled by a control parameter lambda in [0, 1].\n  We sweep lambda and style corpora and report style perplexity under the n-gram model, base-model perplexity as a proxy for fluency, Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence between the original and steered token distributions, and token-overlap statistics. On TinyLlama-1.1B we identify a single narrow regime (for the Don Quixote corpus at lambda=0.1) where style perplexity improves by 24.7% and base-model perplexity improves by 51.4% relative to the frozen model. Outside this regime, and for multi-author corpora such as CNN/DailyMail and arXiv abstracts, even small nonzero lambda values generally result in worse style and fluency, and larger lambda values lead to collapse with extreme perplexities and incoherent text. Logit-space injection of n-gram style priors provides lightweight, tunable style control, but it is fragile: it operates effectively only within a narrow range of low lambda values and is consistently outperformed by prompting and LoRA."}

However, previous methods fuse proprioceptive signals directly with VLM-encoded vision-language features, resulting in state-dominant bias and false completions despite visible execution failures. We attribute this to modality imbalance, where policies over-rely on internal state while underusing visual evidence. To address this, we present ReViP, a novel VLA framework with Vision-Proprioception Rebalance to enhance visual grounding and robustness under perturbations. The key insight is to introduce auxiliary task-aware environment priors to adaptively modulate the coupling between semantic perception and proprioceptive dynamics. Specifically, we use an external VLM as a task-stage observer to extract real-time task-centric visual cues from visual observations, which drive a Vision-Proprioception Feature-wise Linear Modulation to enhance environmental awareness and reduce state-driven errors. Moreover, to evaluate false completion, we propose the first False-Completion Benchmark Suite built on LIBERO with controlled settings such as Object-Drop. Extensive experiments show that ReViP effectively reduces false-completion rates and improves success rates over strong VLA baselines on our suite, with gains extending to LIBERO, RoboTwin 2.0, and real-world evaluations."}

We introduce \\textbf{GameTalk}, a framework for training LLMs to make strategic decisions via multi-turn interactions. Unlike prior work that focuses on single-turn objectives or static action prediction, we train LLMs to optimize a global objective across full conversations. We achieve this by adapting fine-tuning methods like GRPO, DPO, and STaR to incorporate reward signals that depend on the entire interaction. We evaluate this approach on a suite of increasingly complex games, designed to stress different aspects of reasoning, coordination, and opponent modeling. Our results show that GameTalk significantly outperforms untrained models, especially under reward shaping, with DPO consistently yielding the strongest gains.

Virtual environments offer a cost-effective alternative for training DRL agents, but the transfer of learned policies to real setups is hindered by the sim-to-real gap. Achieving zero-shot transfer, where agents perform directly in real environments without additional tuning, is particularly desirable for its efficiency and practical value. This work proposes a novel domain adaptation approach relying on a Style-Identified Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (StyleID-CycleGAN or SICGAN), an original Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) based model. SICGAN translates raw virtual observations into real-synthetic images, creating a hybrid domain for training DRL agents that combines virtual dynamics with real-like visual inputs. Following virtual training, the agent can be directly deployed, bypassing the need for real-world training. The pipeline is validated with two distinct industrial robots in the approaching phase of a pick-and-place operation. In virtual environments agents achieve success rates of 90 to 100\\%, and real-world deployment confirms robust zero-shot transfer (i.e., without additional training in the physical environment) with accuracies above 95\\% for most workspace regions. We use augmented reality targets to improve the evaluation process efficiency, and experimentally demonstrate that the agent successfully generalizes to real objects of varying colors and shapes, including LEGO\\textsuperscript{\\textregistered}~cubes and a mug.

To this end, we use a state-of-the-art multilingual LLM to generate synthetic datasets covering 11 languages and 4 classification tasks. These datasets are then used to train smaller models via fine-tuning or instruction tuning, or as synthetic in-context examples for compact LLMs. Our experiments show that even small amounts of synthetic data enable smaller models to outperform the large generator itself, particularly in low-resource languages.

We introduce Adaptive Reinforcement and Model Predictive Control Switching (ARMS), a hybrid learning-control framework that integrates a reinforcement learning follower trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and an analytical one-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulated as a quadratic program safety filter. To enable robust perception under partial observability and non-stationary human motion, ARMS employs a decoupled sensing architecture with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) temporal encoder for the human-robot relative state and a spatial encoder for 360-degree LiDAR scans. The core contribution is a learned adaptive neural switcher that performs context-aware soft action fusion between the two controllers, favoring conservative, constraint-aware QP-based control in low-risk regions while progressively shifting control authority to the learned follower in highly cluttered or constrained scenarios where maneuverability is critical, and reverting to the follower action when the QP becomes infeasible. Extensive evaluations against Pure Pursuit, Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), and an RL-only baseline demonstrate that ARMS achieves an 82.5 percent success rate in highly cluttered environments, outperforming DWA and RL-only approaches by 7.1 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively, while reducing average computational latency by 33 percent to 5.2 milliseconds compared to a multi-step MPC baseline.

However, how leg crouching enhances sensing is poorly understood, because measuring system vibrations in behaving animals is difficult. We use robophysical modeling to study this problem. Our previous spider robot had only four legs, simplified leg morphology, and a shallow crouching range of motion. Here, we developed a new spider robot, with eight legs, each with four joints that better approximated spider leg morphology. Leg exoskeletons were 3-D printed and joint stiffness was tuned using integrated silicone molding with variable materials and geometry. Tendon-driven actuation allowed a motor in the body to crouch all eight legs deeply as spiders do, while accelerometers at leg joints record leg vibrations. Experiments showed that our new spider robot reproduced key vibration features observed in the previous robot while improving biological accuracy. Our new robot provides a biologically more accurate robophysical model for studying how leg behaviors modulate vibration sensing on a web."}

However, to deliver such assistance, accurate prediction of the user's joint torques is essential. In this work, we propose a feature extraction pipeline using 8-channel surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to predict elbow and shoulder joint torques. For preliminary evaluation, this pipeline was integrated into two neural network models: the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Data were collected from a single subject performing elbow and shoulder movements under three load conditions (0 kg, 1.10 kg, and 1.85 kg) using three motion-capture cameras. Reference torques were estimated from center-of-mass kinematics under the assumption of static equilibrium. Our offline analyses showed that, with our feature extraction pipeline, MLP model achieved mean RMSE of 0.963 N m, 1.403 N m, and 1.434 N m (over five seeds) for elbow, front-shoulder, and side-shoulder joints, respectively, which were comparable to the TCN performance. These results demonstrate that the proposed feature extraction pipeline enables a simple MLP to achieve performance comparable to that of a network designed explicitly for temporal dependencies. This finding is particularly relevant for applications with limited training data, a common scenario patient care."}

For effective alignment using PolyBench, we introduce a knowledge-augmented reasoning distillation method that augments this dataset with structured CoT. Furthermore, tasks in PolyBench are organized from simple to complex analytical reasoning problems, enabling generalization tests and diagnostic probes across the problem space. Experiments show that small language models (SLMs), of 7B to 14B parameters, trained on PolyBench data outperform similar sized models, and even closed source frontier LLMs on PolyBench test dataset while demonstrating gains on other polymer benchmarks as well."}

Here, we examine the applicability of automated scoring on two large datasets of trial exam essays of two full national cohorts from Estonia. We operationalize the official curriculum-based rubric and compare LLM and statistical natural language processing (NLP) based assessments with human panel scores. The results show that automated scoring can achieve performance comparable to that of human raters and tends to fall within the human scoring range.

Furthermore, the system produces fine-grained subscore profiles that can be used to generate systematic, personalized feedback for instruction and exam preparation.

To address this gap, we propose a multimodal data collection framework that employs a dialogue-based interaction protocol and a two-room Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) setup to simulate robot autonomy while eliciting natural user behavior. The framework records five synchronized modalities: RGB-D video, conversational audio, inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals, end-effector Cartesian pose, and whole-body joint states across five assistive tasks. Using this framework, we collected a pilot dataset of 53 trials from five participants and validated its quality through motion smoothness analysis and user feedback. The results show that the framework effectively captures diverse ambiguity types and supports natural dialogue-driven interaction, demonstrating its suitability for scaling to a larger dataset for learning, benchmarking, and evaluation of ambiguity-aware assistive control."}

Our study has these findings: simulation fidelity vs human studies is improved by conditioning base LMs with rich context of narrative identities and checking consistency using instruction-tuned models. We show that LLMs can also model contextual factors such as time (year that a study was performed), question framing, and participant pool effects. LLMs, therefore, allow us to explore the details that affect human studies but which are often omitted from experiment descriptions, and which hamper accurate replication."}

We evaluate CLAS on classification and generation benchmarks, achieving average improvements of 2.3% (Acc.) and 3.4% (F1) respectively, while maintaining high-resource language performance. We discover that effective transfer operates through functional divergence rather than strict alignment; performance gains correlate with increased language cluster separation.

Evaluations on two representative domains: clinician-patient dialogues (CliConSummation) and radiology reports (MIMIC-CXR), show that our approach consistently outperforms embedding-based and self-attribution baselines, improving both text-level and multimodal attribution accuracy (e.g., +15% F1 over embedding baselines). Caption-based attribution achieves competitive performance with raw-image attention while being more lightweight and practical. These findings highlight attention-guided attribution as a promising step toward interpretable and deployable clinical summarization systems."}

By analyzing the linearized relations of final hidden state with respect to inputs, Jacobian Scopes quantify how input tokens influence a model's prediction. We introduce three variants - Semantic, Fisher, and Temperature Scopes - which respectively target sensitivity of specific logits, the full predictive distribution, and model confidence (inverse temperature).

However, their effectiveness in specialized domains, such as remote sensing and medical imaging, remains limited. A natural approach to domain adaptation is to inject domain knowledge through textual instructions, prompts, or auxiliary captions. Surprisingly, we find that such input-level domain knowledge injection yields little to no improvement on scientific multimodal tasks, even when the domain knowledge is explicitly provided. This observation suggests that current MLLMs fail to internalize domain-specific priors through language alone, and that domain knowledge must be integrated at the optimization level. Motivated by this insight, we propose a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that incorporates domain knowledge directly into the learning objective. Instead of treating domain knowledge as descriptive information, we encode it as domain-informed constraints and reward signals, shaping the model's behavior in the output space. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets in remote sensing and medical domains consistently demonstrate good performance gains, achieving state-of-the-art results on multimodal domain tasks. Our results highlight the necessity of optimization-level domain knowledge integration and reveal a fundamental limitation of textual domain conditioning in current MLLMs."}

However, evaluator LLMs exhibit numerical bias, a phenomenon where certain evaluation scores are generated disproportionately often, leading reduced evaluation performance. This study investigates the cause of this bias. Given that most evaluator LLMs are aligned through instruction tuning and preference tuning, and that prior research suggests alignment reduces output diversity, we hypothesize that numerical bias arises from alignment. To test this, we compare outputs from pre- and post-alignment LLMs, and observe that alignment indeed increases numerical bias. We also explore mitigation strategies for post-alignment LLMs, including temperature scaling, distribution calibration, and score range adjustment. Among these, score range adjustment is most effective in reducing bias and improving performance, though still heuristic. Our findings highlight the need for further work on optimal score range selection and more robust mitigation strategies."}

In response, we introduce the task of persona editing, which adversarially steers LLM traits through user-side inputs under a black-box, inference-only setting. To this end, we propose PHISH (Persona Hijacking via Implicit Steering in History), the first framework to expose a new vulnerability in LLM safety that embeds semantically loaded cues into user queries to gradually induce reverse personas. We also define a metric to quantify attack success. Across 3 benchmarks and 8 LLMs, PHISH predictably shifts personas, triggers collateral changes in correlated traits, and exhibits stronger effects in multi-turn settings. In high-risk domains mental health, tutoring, and customer support, PHISH reliably manipulates personas, validated by both human and LLM-as-Judge evaluations. Importantly, PHISH causes only a small reduction in reasoning benchmark performance, leaving overall utility largely intact while still enabling significant persona manipulation.

Existing GRPO-based methods cannot perform fine-grained, turn-level optimization in such settings, while black-box optimization methods discard prior knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose Turn-Level GRPO (TL-GRPO), a lightweight RL algorithm that performs turn-level group sampling for fine-grained optimization.

We introduce Timely-Eval, a benchmark spanning high-frequency tool calls, low-frequency tool calls, and time-constrained reasoning. By varying tool latency, we find smaller models excel with fast feedback through more interactions, while larger models dominate high-latency settings via superior interaction quality. Moreover, existing models fail to adapt reasoning to time budgets. We propose Timely-RL to address this gap.

Evaluating instruction-tuned, reasoning-specialized, and fine-tuned models under zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting, we find that while models perform reasonably on conjunctive and moderately on disjunctive reasoning, performance degrades sharply on negation-based questions.

However, this process can sometimes result in the loss or distortion of the original intended meaning. Due to the human-like quality of LLM-generated text, traditional detection methods often fail, particularly when text is paraphrased to closely mimic original content. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel approach named SearchLLM, designed to identify LLM-paraphrased text by leveraging search engine capabilities to locate potential original text sources. By analyzing similarities between the input and regenerated versions of candidate sources, SearchLLM effectively distinguishes LLM-paraphrased content. SearchLLM is designed as a proxy layer, allowing seamless integration with existing detectors to enhance their performance. Experimental results across various LLMs demonstrate that SearchLLM consistently enhances the accuracy of recent detectors in detecting LLM-paraphrased text that closely mimics original content. Furthermore, SearchLLM also helps the detectors prevent paraphrasing attacks."}

To address this problem, we propose a Retrieve-Refine-Calibrate (RRC) framework based on large language models (LLMs).

Then, it refines the retrieved evidence based on the claim to reduce irrelevant information. Finally, it calibrates the verification process by re-evaluating low-confidence predictions.

Many deep learning models (DLMs) deployed in the production environment are gradually being replaced by VLLMs. Compared with DLMs, VLLMs have some advantages in industrial applications: (1) Their strong generalization ability enables them to perform well across a wide range of tasks. (2) They are flexible and can deal with unfamiliar samples through context learning quickly. However, VLLMs also have obvious drawbacks: (1) VLLMs do not perform as well as custom-developed DLMs in specific domains. (2) The number of parameters in VLLMs is generally quite large, and their deployment requires substantial computational resources. (3) VLLMs generally operate much slower than DLMs, making real-time response challenging to achieve.

To make the model run faster, we also propose a compression-fusion method to improve inference efficiency. AuroraEdge-V-2B has the following notable features: (1) Easy deployment and faster: It has only 2B parameters and is highly suitable for edge deployment, offering better real-time performance. (2) Fewer visual tokens and cheaper: It significantly reduces the number of visual tokens in the decoding process, thereby reducing the floating-point operations by half during inference and making it cheaper to use.

One solution to this problem is to transform data to a standard variant before processing it, which is also called lexical normalization. There has been a wide variety of benchmarks and models proposed for this task. The MultiLexNorm benchmark proposed to unify these efforts, but it consists almost solely of languages from the Indo-European language family in the Latin script. Hence, we propose an extension to MultiLexNorm, which covers 5 Asian languages from different language families in 4 different scripts.

Although separability appears in the residual stream and MLPs, steering using these probes is most effective in a sparse subset of middle-layer attention heads. Using TruthfulQA as the base dataset, we find that probes trained on it transfer effectively to other factual QA benchmarks. Furthermore, comparing our discovered direction to previously identified \"truthful\" directions reveals limited overlap, suggesting that factual accuracy, and deference resistance, arise from related but distinct mechanisms. Attention-pattern analysis further indicates that the influential heads attend disproportionately to expressions of user doubt, contributing to sycophantic shifts. Overall, these findings suggest that sycophancy can be mitigated through simple, targeted linear interventions that exploit the internal geometry of attention activations."}

This paper investigates if it is better to create low-dimensional representations by selecting a small, architecturally informed subset of model components or by projecting the full gradients into a lower-dimensional space. Using a novel benchmark, we show that a greedily selected subset of components captures the information about training data influence needed for a retrieval task more effectively than either the full gradient or random projection.

However, existing legal benchmarks rely on simplified and highly standardized tasks, failing to capture the ambiguity, complexity, and reasoning demands of real legal practice. Moreover, prior evaluations often adopt coarse, single-dimensional metrics and do not explicitly assess fine-grained legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce PLawBench, a Practical Law Benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic legal practice scenarios. Grounded in real-world legal workflows, PLawBench models the core processes of legal practitioners through three task categories: public legal consultation, practical case analysis, and legal document generation. These tasks assess a model's ability to identify legal issues and key facts, perform structured legal reasoning, and generate legally coherent documents. PLawBench comprises 850 questions across 13 practical legal scenarios, with each question accompanied by expert-designed evaluation rubrics, resulting in approximately 12,500 rubric items for fine-grained assessment. Using an LLM-based evaluator aligned with human expert judgments, we evaluate 10 state-of-the-art LLMs. Experimental results show that none achieves strong performance on PLawBench, revealing substantial limitations in the fine-grained legal reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and highlighting important directions for future evaluation and development of legal LLMs. Data is available at: https://github.com/skylenage/PLawbench."}

We evaluate memory agents with strong LMs/VLMs as backbones, using in-context prompting as baselines. Across 15 text games and multiple visual seeds, results are far from saturated: induction and spatial reasoning are persistent bottlenecks, especially in visual setting. Persistent memory yields clear gains for open backbones on text games, but improvements are less consistent for VLM agents, suggesting that visually grounded episodic memory remains an open challenge.

Many recent automated radiology report generation methods are designed to capture longitudinal information; however, validating their performance is challenging. There is no proper tool to consistently label temporal changes in both ground-truth and model-generated texts for meaningful comparisons. Existing annotation methods are typically labor-intensive, relying on the use of manual lexicons and rules. Complex rules are closed-source, domain specific and hard to adapt, whereas overly simple ones tend to miss essential specialised information. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising annotation alternative, as they are capable of capturing nuanced linguistic patterns and semantic similarities without extensive manual intervention. They also adapt well to new contexts. In this study, we therefore propose an LLM-based pipeline to automatically annotate longitudinal information in radiology reports. The pipeline first identifies sentences containing relevant information and then extracts the progression of diseases. We evaluate and compare five mainstream LLMs on these two tasks using 500 manually annotated reports. Considering both efficiency and performance, Qwen2.5-32B was subsequently selected and used to annotate another 95,169 reports from the public MIMIC-CXR dataset. Our Qwen2.5-32B-annotated dataset provided us with a standardized benchmark for evaluating report generation models.

We study the intersection of these issues and ask: do hallucination detectors suffer from the low-resource effect? We conduct experiments on five tasks across three domains (factual recall, STEM, and Humanities). Experiments with four LLMs and three hallucination detectors reveal a curious finding: As expected, the task accuracies in low-resource languages experience large drops (compared to English). However, the drop in detectors' accuracy is often several times smaller than the drop in task accuracy. Our findings suggest that even in low-resource languages, the internal mechanisms of LLMs might encode signals about their uncertainty. Further, the detectors are robust within language (even for non-English) and in multilingual setups, but not in cross-lingual settings without in-language supervision."}

We evaluate P-Tokens across two editing datasets and three LLMs, demonstrating performance comparable to, and often exceeding, IKE. We further find that editing performance is robust to distractors with small negative effects to neighboring facts, and that increasing the number of P-Tokens improves performance.

To quantify SoS tendencies across models, languages, and cultures, we introduce a novel measure and analyze how the tendencies we identify manifest visually. We show that all but one model exhibit strong surface-level tendency in at least two languages, with this effect intensifying across the layers of T2I text encoders. Moreover, these surface tendencies frequently correlate with stereotypical visual depictions."}

Disentangling fluid and crystallized intelligence of large language models using chess", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, yet it remains unclear to what extent these reflect sophisticated recall (crystallized intelligence) or reasoning ability (fluid intelligence). We introduce chess as a controlled testbed for disentangling these faculties. Leveraging the game's structure and scalable engine evaluations, we construct a taxonomy of positions varying in training corpus proximity--ranging from common states solvable by memorization to novel ones requiring first-principles reasoning. We systematically evaluate multiple GPT generations under varying reasoning intensities. Our analysis reveals a clear gradient: performance consistently degrades as fluid intelligence demands increase. Notably, in out-of-distribution tasks, performance collapses to random levels. While newer models improve, progress slows significantly for tasks outside the training distribution. Furthermore, while reasoning-augmented inference improves performance, its marginal benefit per token decreases with distributional proximity. These results suggest current architectures remain limited in systematic generalization, highlighting the need for mechanisms beyond scale to achieve robust fluid intelligence."}

Existing adversarial frameworks typically rely on injecting noise or altering semantics, yet no existing framework exploits the adversarial potential of persuasion techniques, which are widely used in disinformation campaigns to manipulate audiences. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of persuasive adversarial attacks on AFCs by employing a generative LLM to rephrase claims using persuasion techniques. Considering 15 techniques grouped into 6 categories, we study the effects of persuasion on both claim verification and evidence retrieval using a decoupled evaluation strategy. Experiments on the FEVER and FEVEROUS benchmarks show that persuasion attacks can substantially degrade both verification performance and evidence retrieval. Our analysis identifies persuasion techniques as a potent class of adversarial attacks, highlighting the need for more robust AFC systems."}

To quantify any potential reflection biases, we introduce a permutation-based evaluation framework. With this, we observe that state-of-the-art embedding models exhibit systematic positional and language biases when documents are longer and consist of multiple segments. Specifically, early segments and segments in higher-resource languages like English are over-represented, while later segments and segments in lower-resource languages are marginalized. In our further analysis, we find that the positional bias stems from front-loaded attention distributions in pooling-token embeddings, where early tokens receive more attention. To mitigate this issue, we introduce an inference-time attention calibration method that redistributes attention more evenly across document positions, increasing discoverabiltiy of later segments. Our evaluation framework and attention calibration is available at https://github.com/impresso/fair-sentence-transformers"}

Unlike encoder-based models, however, generative architectures lack an explicit mechanism to refer to specific parts of their input. This leads to a variety of ad-hoc prompting strategies for span labeling, often with inconsistent results. In this paper, we categorize these strategies into three families: tagging the input text, indexing numerical positions of spans, and matching span content. To address the limitations of content matching, we introduce LogitMatch, a new constrained decoding method that forces the model's output to align with valid input spans. We evaluate all methods across four diverse tasks. We find that while tagging remains a robust baseline, LogitMatch improves upon competitive matching-based methods by eliminating span matching issues and outperforms other strategies in some setups."}
