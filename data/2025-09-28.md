Abstract: Semantic segmentation of LiDAR data presents considerable challenges,
particularly when dealing with diverse sensor types and configurations.
However, incorporating semantic information can significantly enhance the
accuracy and robustness of LiDAR-based localization techniques for autonomous
mobile systems. We propose an approach that integrates semantic camera data
with LiDAR segmentation to address this challenge. By projecting LiDAR points
into the semantic segmentation space of the camera, our method enhances the
precision and reliability of the LiDAR-based localization pipeline.
  For validation, we utilize the CoCar NextGen platform from the FZI Research
Center for Information Technology, which offers diverse sensor modalities and
configurations. The sensor setup of CoCar NextGen enables a thorough analysis
of different sensor types. Our evaluation leverages the state-of-the-art
Depth-Anything network for camera image segmentation and an adaptive
segmentation network for LiDAR segmentation. To establish a reliable ground
truth for LiDAR-based localization, we make us of a Global Navigation Satellite
System (GNSS) solution with Real-Time Kinematic corrections (RTK).
Additionally, we conduct an extensive 55 km drive through the city of
Karlsruhe, Germany, covering a variety of environments, including urban areas,
multi-lane roads, and rural highways. This multimodal approach paves the way
for more reliable and precise autonomous navigation systems, particularly in
complex real-world environments.

Abstract: This paper presents the initial results from our structured literature review
on applications of Formal Methods (FM) to Robotic Autonomous Systems (RAS). We
describe our structured survey methodology; including database selection and
associated search strings, search filters and collaborative review of
identified papers. We categorise and enumerate the FM approaches and formalisms
that have been used for specification and verification of RAS. We investigate
FM in the context of sub-symbolic AI-enabled RAS and examine the evolution of
how FM is used over time in this field. This work complements a pre-existing
survey in this area and we examine how this research area has matured over
time. Specifically, our survey demonstrates that some trends have persisted as
observed in a previous survey. Additionally, it recognized new trends that were
not considered previously including a noticeable increase in adopting Formal
Synthesis approaches as well as Probabilistic Verification Techniques.

### [3] [Boosting Zero-Shot VLN via Abstract Obstacle Map-Based Waypoint Prediction with TopoGraph-and-VisitInfo-Aware Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20499)
*Boqi Li,Siyuan Li,Weiyi Wang,Anran Li,Zhong Cao,Henry X. Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本视觉语言导航框架，结合简化的路径点预测器和多模态大语言模型，在连续环境中实现导航任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型和机器人技术的快速发展，视觉语言导航成为具身智能体的关键任务，特别是在连续环境中的导航具有挑战性

Method: 使用在抽象障碍地图上操作的路径点预测器生成线性可达路径点，构建动态更新的拓扑图并记录访问历史，将这些信息编码到提示中供MLLM进行推理

Result: 在R2R-CE和RxR-CE数据集上分别达到41%和36%的成功率，实现了最先进的零样本性能

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合路径点预测和MLLM推理，在连续环境中实现了有效的视觉语言导航，显著优于现有方法

Abstract: With the rapid progress of foundation models and robotics, vision-language
navigation (VLN) has emerged as a key task for embodied agents with broad
practical applications. We address VLN in continuous environments, a
particularly challenging setting where an agent must jointly interpret natural
language instructions, perceive its surroundings, and plan low-level actions.
We propose a zero-shot framework that integrates a simplified yet effective
waypoint predictor with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). The predictor
operates on an abstract obstacle map, producing linearly reachable waypoints,
which are incorporated into a dynamically updated topological graph with
explicit visitation records. The graph and visitation information are encoded
into the prompt, enabling reasoning over both spatial structure and exploration
history to encourage exploration and equip MLLM with local path planning for
error correction. Extensive experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, with success rates of
41% and 36%, respectively, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MELEGROS是一种受大象鼻子启发的单块软体抓取器，通过3D打印将光学传感器和气动腔直接集成到连续结构中，实现了感知、驱动和结构的无缝融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受到大象鼻子这种自然抓取器的启发，旨在开发一种将结构、驱动和感知无缝集成的软体机器人，避免传统多材料或肌腱驱动方法中的机械不匹配问题。

Method: 使用单一软树脂材料，通过连续3D打印将6个光学波导传感器和5个气动腔直接集成到气动驱动的晶格结构中（12.5mm晶格尺寸），实现感知作为固有、共制造的能力。

Result: 仅需4次迭代就完成了最终原型，能够进行伸长、压缩和弯曲，同时解耦触觉和本体感觉信号。抓取器重132克，可举起超过自身重量两倍的物体，执行捏取、舀取和伸展等仿生动作，并能轻柔抓握葡萄等易碎物品。

Conclusion: MELEGROS展示了软体机器人的新范式，其中完全嵌入的感知和连续结构固有地支持多功能、仿生操作，为软体机器人设计提供了新的方向。

Abstract: The elephant trunk exemplifies a natural gripper where structure, actuation,
and sensing are seamlessly integrated. Inspired by the distal morphology of the
African elephant trunk, we present MELEGROS, a Monolithic ELEphant-inspired
GRipper with Optical Sensors, emphasizing sensing as an intrinsic,
co-fabricated capability. Unlike multi-material or tendon-based approaches,
MELEGROS directly integrates six optical waveguide sensors and five pneumatic
chambers into a pneumatically actuated lattice structure (12.5 mm cell size)
using a single soft resin and one continuous 3D print. This eliminates
mechanical mismatches between sensors, actuators, and body, reducing model
uncertainty and enabling simulation-guided sensor design and placement. Only
four iterations were required to achieve the final prototype, which features a
continuous structure capable of elongation, compression, and bending while
decoupling tactile and proprioceptive signals. MELEGROS (132 g) lifts more than
twice its weight, performs bioinspired actions such as pinching, scooping, and
reaching, and delicately grasps fragile items like grapes. The integrated
optical sensors provide distinct responses to touch, bending, and chamber
deformation, enabling multifunctional perception. MELEGROS demonstrates a new
paradigm for soft robotics where fully embedded sensing and continuous
structures inherently support versatile, bioinspired manipulation.

### [5] [Action-Informed Estimation and Planning: Clearing Clutter on Staircases via Quadrupedal Pedipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20516)
*Prasanna Sriganesh,Barath Satheeshkumar,Anushree Sabnis,Matthew Travers*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于四足机器人在密集杂乱环境中（如楼梯）进行单腿推物操作的感知-动作框架，通过本体感知反馈预测被推物体在遮挡期间的位移，实现闭环控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 四足机器人在密集杂乱环境中需要与障碍物进行物理交互来清理路径，但单腿推物操作会导致被推物体被遮挡，难以持续跟踪。

Method: 开发了交互感知的状态估计循环，利用足部接触和腿部位置的本体感知反馈来预测物体在遮挡期间的位移，指导感知系统在交互后重新检测物体。

Result: 在波士顿动力Spot机器人上的实验表明，该方法在楼梯推物任务中比开环基线方法具有更高的任务成功率和跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 交互感知的闭环方法能够有效解决四足机器人单腿推物操作中的物体遮挡问题，提高在复杂环境中的操作性能。

Abstract: For robots to operate autonomously in densely cluttered environments, they
must reason about and potentially physically interact with obstacles to clear a
path. Safely clearing a path on challenging terrain, such as a cluttered
staircase, requires controlled interaction. For example, a quadrupedal robot
that pushes objects out of the way with one leg while maintaining a stable
stance with its three other legs. However, tightly coupled physical actions,
such as one-legged pushing, create new constraints on the system that can be
difficult to predict at design time. In this work, we present a new method that
addresses one such constraint, wherein the object being pushed by a quadrupedal
robot with one of its legs becomes occluded from the robot's sensors during
manipulation. To address this challenge, we present a tightly coupled
perception-action framework that enables the robot to perceive clutter, reason
about feasible push paths, and execute the clearing maneuver. Our core
contribution is an interaction-aware state estimation loop that uses
proprioceptive feedback regarding foot contact and leg position to predict an
object's displacement during the occlusion. This prediction guides the
perception system to robustly re-detect the object after the interaction,
closing the loop between action and sensing to enable accurate tracking even
after partial pushes. Using this feedback allows the robot to learn from
physical outcomes, reclassifying an object as immovable if a push fails due to
it being too heavy. We present results of implementing our approach on a Boston
Dynamics Spot robot that show our interaction-aware approach achieves higher
task success rates and tracking accuracy in pushing objects on stairs compared
to open-loop baselines.

### [6] [Selective Progress-Aware Querying for Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20541)
*Anujith Muraleedharan,Anamika J H*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPARQ是一种基于学习进度的查询策略，只在学习停滞或恶化时请求人类反馈，显著减少不必要的反馈调用，在保持高性能的同时节省约一半的反馈预算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中人类反馈成本高昂且有限，现有的人机交互强化学习方法假设反馈充足，限制了其在物理机器人部署中的实用性。

Method: 提出SPARQ策略，通过监测学习进度，仅在性能停滞或下降时请求人类反馈，避免不必要的反馈调用。在PyBullet模拟环境中使用UR5机器人进行方块抓取任务评估。

Result: SPARQ实现了接近完美的任务成功率，与始终查询策略性能相当，但仅消耗约一半的反馈预算。相比随机查询提供更稳定高效的学习，显著优于无反馈训练。

Conclusion: 基于进度的选择性查询策略能够使人机交互强化学习在现实人类努力约束下更加高效和可扩展。

Abstract: Human feedback can greatly accelerate robot learning, but in real-world
settings, such feedback is costly and limited. Existing human-in-the-loop
reinforcement learning (HiL-RL) methods often assume abundant feedback,
limiting their practicality for physical robot deployment. In this work, we
introduce SPARQ, a progress-aware query policy that requests feedback only when
learning stagnates or worsens, thereby reducing unnecessary oracle calls. We
evaluate SPARQ on a simulated UR5 cube-picking task in PyBullet, comparing
against three baselines: no feedback, random querying, and always querying. Our
experiments show that SPARQ achieves near-perfect task success, matching the
performance of always querying while consuming about half the feedback budget.
It also provides more stable and efficient learning than random querying, and
significantly improves over training without feedback. These findings suggest
that selective, progress-based query strategies can make HiL-RL more efficient
and scalable for robots operating under realistic human effort constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人抓取模型在遇到新物体时泛化能力不足的问题，特别是在工业自动化环境中需要处理多样化物体的情况。

Method: 创建GraspFactory大规模数据集，包含Franka Panda和Robotiq 2F-85夹具的1.09亿个6-DoF抓取数据，用于训练数据密集型模型。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界环境中验证了基于GraspFactory数据集训练的模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GraspFactory为训练通用机器人抓取模型提供了大规模几何多样化数据集，有助于提升模型在现实环境中的泛化性能。

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a crucial task in industrial automation, where robots are
increasingly expected to handle a wide range of objects. However, a significant
challenge arises when robot grasping models trained on limited datasets
encounter novel objects. In real-world environments such as warehouses or
manufacturing plants, the diversity of objects can be vast, and grasping models
need to generalize to this diversity. Training large, generalizable
robot-grasping models requires geometrically diverse datasets. In this paper,
we introduce GraspFactory, a dataset containing over 109 million 6-DoF grasps
collectively for the Franka Panda (with 14,690 objects) and Robotiq 2F-85
grippers (with 33,710 objects). GraspFactory is designed for training
data-intensive models, and we demonstrate the generalization capabilities of
one such model trained on a subset of GraspFactory in both simulated and
real-world settings. The dataset and tools are made available for download at

Conclusion: 该工作为开发全自主环境监测能力做出了贡献，这对于快速响应海洋污染事件至关重要。

Abstract: This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware marine pollution source tracking
framework for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). By integrating high-fidelity
marine pollution dispersion simulation with informative path planning
techniques, we demonstrate effective identification of pollution sources in
marine environments. The proposed approach is implemented based on Robot
Operating System (ROS), processing real-time sensor data to update
probabilistic source location estimates. The system progressively refines the
estimation of source location while quantifying uncertainty levels in its
predictions. Experiments conducted in simulated environments with varying
source locations, flow conditions, and starting positions demonstrate the
framework's ability to localise pollution sources with high accuracy. Results
show that the proposed approach achieves reliable source localisation
efficiently. This work contributes to the development of full autonomous
environmental monitoring capabilities essential for rapid response to marine
pollution incidents.

### [9] [Latent Activation Editing: Inference-Time Refinement of Learned Policies for Safer Multirobot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20623)

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一个推理时潜在激活编辑框架，在不修改预训练策略权重的情况下，通过在线检测和编辑中间激活来提升多四旋翼无人机导航的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 即使训练良好的强化学习策略在复杂环境中仍容易发生碰撞，而重新训练或微调成本高且可能影响已学技能。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：在线分类器监测中间激活检测不良行为状态，激活编辑模块选择性修改标记的激活以转向更安全的行为模式。

Result: 在仿真和真实实验中，LAE实现了碰撞次数显著减少（比基线减少近90%），大幅提高无碰撞轨迹比例，同时保持任务完成率。

Conclusion: LAE是一种轻量级范式，可在资源受限硬件上实现学习机器人策略的部署后优化。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has enabled significant progress in complex domains
such as coordinating and navigating multiple quadrotors. However, even
well-trained policies remain vulnerable to collisions in obstacle-rich
environments. Addressing these infrequent but critical safety failures through
retraining or fine-tuning is costly and risks degrading previously learned
skills. Inspired by activation steering in large language models and latent
editing in computer vision, we introduce a framework for inference-time Latent
Activation Editing (LAE) that refines the behavior of pre-trained policies
without modifying their weights or architecture. The framework operates in two
stages: (i) an online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect
states associated with undesired behaviors, and (ii) an activation editing
module that selectively modifies flagged activations to shift the policy
towards safer regimes. In this work, we focus on improving safety in
multi-quadrotor navigation. We hypothesize that amplifying a policy's internal
perception of risk can induce safer behaviors. We instantiate this idea through
a latent collision world model trained to predict future pre-collision
activations, thereby prompting earlier and more cautious avoidance responses.
Extensive simulations and real-world Crazyflie experiments demonstrate that LAE
achieves statistically significant reduction in collisions (nearly 90% fewer
cumulative collisions compared to the unedited baseline) and substantially
increases the fraction of collision-free trajectories, while preserving task
completion. More broadly, our results establish LAE as a lightweight paradigm,
feasible on resource-constrained hardware, for post-deployment refinement of
learned robot policies.

Abstract: Legged robots must exhibit robust and agile locomotion across diverse,
unstructured terrains, a challenge exacerbated under blind locomotion settings
where terrain information is unavailable. This work introduces a hierarchical
reinforcement learning framework that leverages terrain-specialized policies
and curriculum learning to enhance agility and tracking performance in complex
environments. We validated our method on simulation, where our approach
outperforms a generalist policy by up to 16% in success rate and achieves lower

and discontinuous terrains, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness
across mixed-terrain scenarios.

Conclusion: 通过超越仿人约束，新型机器人本体不仅能降低收集稳健操作数据的门槛，还能稳定地单手完成通常需要两只人手的任务。

Abstract: Dexterous in-hand manipulation remains a foundational challenge in robotics,
with progress often constrained by the prevailing paradigm of imitating the
human hand. This anthropomorphic approach creates two critical barriers: 1) it
limits robotic capabilities to tasks humans can already perform, and 2) it
makes data collection for learning-based methods exceedingly difficult. Both
challenges are caused by traditional force-closure which requires coordinating
complex, multi-point contacts based on friction, normal force, and gravity to
grasp an object. This makes teleoperated demonstrations unstable and amplifies
the sim-to-real gap for reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose a
paradigm shift: moving away from replicating human mechanics toward the design
of novel robotic embodiments. We introduce the \textbf{S}uction
\textbf{Leap}-Hand (SLeap Hand), a multi-fingered hand featuring integrated
fingertip suction cups that realize a new form of suction-enabled dexterity. By
replacing complex force-closure grasps with stable, single-point adhesion, our
design fundamentally simplifies in-hand teleoperation and facilitates the
collection of high-quality demonstration data. More importantly, this
suction-based embodiment unlocks a new class of dexterous skills that are
difficult or even impossible for the human hand, such as one-handed paper
cutting and in-hand writing. Our work demonstrates that by moving beyond
anthropomorphic constraints, novel embodiments can not only lower the barrier
for collecting robust manipulation data but also enable the stable,
single-handed completion of tasks that would typically require two human hands.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补现有共享控制方案在复杂任务技能获取评估方面的空白，特别是针对高性能驾驶（如赛车和紧急避障）场景。

Conclusion: 触觉共享控制框架能有效促进人类驾驶员在复杂驾驶任务中的技能获取，优于传统训练方法。

Abstract: This study introduces a haptic shared control framework designed to teach
human drivers advanced driving skills. In this context, shared control refers
to a driving mode where the human driver collaborates with an autonomous
driving system to control the steering of a vehicle simultaneously. Advanced
driving skills are those necessary to safely push the vehicle to its handling
limits in high-performance driving such as racing and emergency obstacle
avoidance. Previous research has demonstrated the performance and safety
benefits of shared control schemes using both subjective and objective
evaluations. However, these schemes have not been assessed for their impact on
skill acquisition on complex and demanding tasks. Prior research on long-term
skill acquisition either applies haptic shared control to simple tasks or
employs other feedback methods like visual and auditory aids. To bridge this
gap, this study creates a cyber racing coach framework based on the haptic
shared control paradigm and evaluates its performance in helping human drivers
acquire high-performance driving skills. The framework introduces (1) an
autonomous driving system that is capable of cooperating with humans in a
highly performant driving scenario; and (2) a haptic shared control mechanism
along with a fading scheme to gradually reduce the steering assistance from
autonomy based on the human driver's performance during training. Two
benchmarks are considered: self-learning (no assistance) and full assistance
during training. Results from a human subject study indicate that the proposed
framework helps human drivers develop superior racing skills compared to the
benchmarks, resulting in better performance and consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BCI-机器人系统存在EEG信号噪声大、目标选择不灵活、缺乏闭环验证等问题，阻碍了在辅助场景中的实际部署。

Method: 使用14通道EEG头戴设备进行个性化运动想象校准，智能手机AR界面提供多目标导航和方向一致反馈，机器人手臂结合决策输出和视觉姿态估计实现自主抓取。

Result: 运动想象训练准确率达93.1%，平均信息传输率14.8 bit/min；AR神经反馈显著提升持续控制能力(SCI=0.210)，最高ITR达21.3 bit/min；闭环抓取成功率97.2%，用户控制感强。

Conclusion: AR反馈显著稳定了基于EEG的控制，所提框架实现了稳健的零接触抓取，推进了辅助机器人应用和未来人机交互模式。

Abstract: Reliable brain-computer interface (BCI) control of robots provides an
intuitive and accessible means of human-robot interaction, particularly
valuable for individuals with motor impairments. However, existing BCI-Robot
systems face major limitations: electroencephalography (EEG) signals are noisy
and unstable, target selection is often predefined and inflexible, and most
studies remain restricted to simulation without closed-loop validation. These
issues hinder real-world deployment in assistive scenarios. To address them, we
propose a closed-loop BCI-AR-Robot system that integrates motor imagery
(MI)-based EEG decoding, augmented reality (AR) neurofeedback, and robotic
grasping for zero-touch operation. A 14-channel EEG headset enabled
individualized MI calibration, a smartphone-based AR interface supported
multi-target navigation with direction-congruent feedback to enhance stability,
and the robotic arm combined decision outputs with vision-based pose estimation
for autonomous grasping. Experiments are conducted to validate the framework:
MI training achieved 93.1 percent accuracy with an average information transfer
rate (ITR) of 14.8 bit/min; AR neurofeedback significantly improved sustained
control (SCI = 0.210) and achieved the highest ITR (21.3 bit/min) compared with
static, sham, and no-AR baselines; and closed-loop grasping achieved a 97.2
percent success rate with good efficiency and strong user-reported control.
These results show that AR feedback substantially stabilizes EEG-based control
and that the proposed framework enables robust zero-touch grasping, advancing
assistive robotic applications and future modes of human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles and robots rely on accurate odometry estimation in
GPS-denied environments. While LiDARs and cameras struggle under extreme
weather, 4D mmWave radar emerges as a robust alternative with all-weather
operability and velocity measurement. In this paper, we introduce Equi-RO, an
equivariant network-based framework for 4D radar odometry. Our algorithm
pre-processes Doppler velocity into invariant node and edge features in the
graph, and employs separate networks for equivariant and invariant feature
processing. A graph-based architecture enhances feature aggregation in sparse

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FINS是一个轻量级框架，能够从单张或少量图像快速重建高保真表面和SDF场，训练时间仅需几秒，在表面重建和SDF场估计方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式表面重建方法如NeuS需要大量多视角图像和长时间训练，限制了实际应用。本文旨在开发能够从单张图像快速重建神经表面的方法。

Method: FINS结合多分辨率哈希网格编码器和轻量级几何/颜色头，使用近似二阶优化器实现高效训练。利用预训练基础模型从单张RGB图像估计几何信息。

Result: 实验表明，在相同条件下，FINS在收敛速度和表面重建、SDF场估计精度方面均优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: FINS实现了从单张图像快速重建神经表面的目标，在机器人表面跟随任务中表现出良好的应用潜力，并适用于多种基准数据集。

Abstract: Implicit representations have been widely applied in robotics for obstacle
avoidance and path planning. In this paper, we explore the problem of
constructing an implicit distance representation from a single image. Past
methods for implicit surface reconstruction, such as \emph{NeuS} and its
variants generally require a large set of multi-view images as input, and
require long training times. In this work, we propose Fast Image-to-Neural
Surface (FINS), a lightweight framework that can reconstruct high-fidelity
surfaces and SDF fields based on a single or a small set of images. FINS
integrates a multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry and
color heads, making the training via an approximate second-order optimizer
highly efficient and capable of converging within a few seconds. Additionally,
we achieve the construction of a neural surface requiring only a single RGB
image, by leveraging pre-trained foundation models to estimate the geometry
inherent in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that under the same
conditions, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
convergence speed and accuracy on surface reconstruction and SDF field
estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of FINS for robot
surface following tasks and show its scalability to a variety of benchmark
datasets.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RAM-NAS是一种资源感知的多目标神经架构搜索方法，专注于改进超网络预训练和机器人硬件设备的资源感知能力，通过子网互蒸馏和延迟代理预测器来平衡模型精度和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经架构搜索方法在训练超网络方面不足，且很少关注实际机器人硬件资源。需要开发能够考虑机器人硬件资源的多目标NAS方法。

Method: 提出子网互蒸馏概念，使用三明治规则采样子网进行互蒸馏；采用解耦知识蒸馏损失增强logits蒸馏性能；使用三种机器人边缘硬件数据训练延迟代理预测器，在搜索阶段估计硬件推理延迟；采用统一多目标进化搜索平衡精度和延迟。

Result: RAM-NAS模型在ImageNet上达到76.7%至81.4%的top-1准确率；相比基于MobileNetv3的方法，在所有三种硬件类型上检测和分割的推理时间均减少；显著降低模型在机器人边缘硬件上的推理延迟。

Conclusion: RAM-NAS填补了NAS在机器人硬件资源感知方面的空白，通过资源感知多目标NAS显著提升了模型在边缘硬件上的性能表现。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great promise in automatically
designing lightweight models. However, conventional approaches are insufficient
in training the supernet and pay little attention to actual robot hardware
resources. To meet such challenges, we propose RAM-NAS, a resource-aware
multi-objective NAS method that focuses on improving the supernet pretrain and
resource-awareness on robot hardware devices. We introduce the concept of
subnets mutual distillation, which refers to mutually distilling all subnets
sampled by the sandwich rule. Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge
Distillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite
the search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from
three types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors.
These predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency
during the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search
to balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs. Our discovered model family,
RAM-NAS models, can achieve top-1 accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 81.4% on
ImageNet. In addition, the resource-aware multi-objective NAS we employ
significantly reduces the model's inference latency on edge hardware for
robots. We conducted experiments on downstream tasks to verify the scalability
of our methods. The inference time for detection and segmentation is reduced on
all three hardware types compared to MobileNetv3-based methods. Our work fills
the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-aware.

Result: 与点足模型相比，改进的模型具有更好的步态特性，能够通过足部放置和踝关节策略稳定大初始误差，仅通过踝关节方案稳定小扰动。

Conclusion: 所提出的模型展示了类似人类的稳定特性，有助于更好地理解拟人行走及其稳定机制，特别是踝关节在稳定中的重要作用。

Abstract: This paper extends the forced-oscillation-based reduced-order model of
walking to a model with ankles and feet. A human-inspired paradigm was designed
for the ankle dynamics, which results in improved gait characteristics compared
to the point-foot model. In addition, it was shown that while the proposed
model can stabilize against large errors in initial conditions through
combination of foot placement and ankle strategies, the model is able to
stabilize against small perturbations without relying on the foot placement
control and solely through the designed proprioceptive ankle scheme. This novel
property, which is also observed in humans, can help in better understanding of
anthropomorphic walking and its stabilization mechanisms.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RuN是一个解耦的残差学习框架，通过将预训练的条件运动生成器与强化学习策略配对，实现人形机器人从走到跑的自然动态步态转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人形机器人在广泛速度范围内实现自然动态步态（包括从走到跑的平滑转换）的挑战，现有方法需要单一策略同时学习运动模仿、速度跟踪和稳定性维护。

Method: 引入RuN框架，将控制任务分解：预训练的条件运动生成器提供运动先验，强化学习策略学习轻量级残差修正来处理动力学交互。

Result: 在Unitree G1人形机器人上的仿真和现实实验表明，RuN在0-2.5 m/s速度范围内实现了稳定自然的步态和平滑的走跑转换，在训练效率和最终性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RuN框架通过解耦控制任务，有效解决了人形机器人动态步态控制问题，实现了优越的步态质量和训练效率。

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to achieve natural and dynamic locomotion across a
wide range of speeds, including smooth transitions from walking to running,
presents a significant challenge. Existing deep reinforcement learning methods
typically require the policy to directly track a reference motion, forcing a
single policy to simultaneously learn motion imitation, velocity tracking, and
stability maintenance. To address this, we introduce RuN, a novel decoupled
residual learning framework. RuN decomposes the control task by pairing a
pre-trained Conditional Motion Generator, which provides a kinematically
natural motion prior, with a reinforcement learning policy that learns a
lightweight residual correction to handle dynamical interactions. Experiments
in simulation and reality on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot demonstrate that RuN
achieves stable, natural gaits and smooth walk-run transitions across a broad
velocity range (0-2.5 m/s), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both
training efficiency and final performance.

TL;DR: 提出了JFTO框架，通过关节流轨迹优化解决从人类视频演示中学习机器人操作的问题，将演示视为物体中心指导，平衡抓取姿态可行性、物体轨迹一致性和无碰撞执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从人类视频演示学习为机器人操作提供了可扩展的替代方案，但由于身体差异和关节可行性约束而面临挑战。

Method: 扩展流匹配到SE(3)空间进行物体轨迹的概率建模，将抓取相似性、轨迹似然和碰撞惩罚整合到统一的可微分目标函数中。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界实验中验证了该方法在多样化操作任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: JFTO框架能够有效处理从人类视频演示中学习机器人操作的问题，实现抓取姿态生成和物体轨迹模仿。

Abstract: Learning from human video demonstrations offers a scalable alternative to
teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching, but poses challenges for robot
manipulators due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints.
We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization
(JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation
under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than
directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as
object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible
grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated
motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics.
To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to
$\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling
density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization
integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties
into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation
tasks.

TL;DR: BIM2RDT框架通过AI技术将静态BIM模型转化为动态的机器人就绪数字孪生，集成了BIM几何语义、IoT传感器数据和机器人视觉数据，使用SG-ICP算法提升点云配准精度，并整合实时安全监测功能。


<details>

Motivation: 解决建筑行业中静态BIM数据与实时现场条件之间的差距，提升施工安全性和数字化管理水平。

Method: 开发BIM2RDT框架，集成BIM、IoT和机器人视觉数据流；提出SG-ICP点云配准算法，利用LLM推理物体方向先验；采用YOLOE目标检测和Shi-Tomasi角点检测；整合实时手部振动监测。

Result: SG-ICP相比标准ICP在特征遮挡场景中RMSE降低64.3%-88.3%；HAV集成在超过暴露限值时触发警告，符合ISO 5349-1标准。

Conclusion: BIM2RDT框架成功将静态BIM转化为动态数字孪生，显著提升了施工安全性和机器人操作的准确性。

Abstract: The adoption of cyber-physical systems and jobsite intelligence that connects
design models, real-time site sensing, and autonomous field operations can
dramatically enhance digital management in the construction industry. This
paper introduces BIM2RDT (Building Information Models to Robot-Ready Site
Digital Twins), an agentic artificial intelligence (AI) framework designed to
transform static Building Information Modeling (BIM) into dynamic, robot-ready
digital twins (DTs) that prioritize safety during execution. The framework
bridges the gap between pre-existing BIM data and real-time site conditions by
integrating three key data streams: geometric and semantic information from BIM
models, activity data from IoT sensor networks, and visual-spatial data
collected by robots during site traversal. The methodology introduces
Semantic-Gravity ICP (SG-ICP), a point cloud registration algorithm that
leverages large language model (LLM) reasoning. Unlike traditional methods,
SG-ICP utilizes an LLM to infer object-specific, plausible orientation priors
based on BIM semantics, improving alignment accuracy by avoiding convergence on
local minima. This creates a feedback loop where robot-collected data updates
the DT, which in turn optimizes paths for missions. The framework employs YOLOE
object detection and Shi-Tomasi corner detection to identify and track
construction elements while using BIM geometry as a priori maps. The framework
also integrates real-time Hand-Arm Vibration (HAV) monitoring, mapping
sensor-detected safety events to the digital twin using IFC standards for
intervention. Experiments demonstrate SG-ICP's superiority over standard ICP,
achieving RMSE reductions of 64.3%--88.3% in alignment across scenarios with
occluded features, ensuring plausible orientations. HAV integration triggers
warnings upon exceeding exposure limits, enhancing compliance with ISO 5349-1.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将自然语言指令与BIM语义地图融合的机器人任务规划框架，通过Beta-Bernoulli贝叶斯融合将LLM视为传感器，生成上下文感知的排斥增益来改进路径规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在建筑领域，BIM模型包含丰富的环境自然语言描述，需要将自然语言指令与这些语义信息融合，使机器人能够执行更安全、更符合上下文的路径规划。

Method: 将障碍物的设计时排斥系数建模为Beta(alpha, beta)随机变量，将LLM返回的危险分数作为伪计数来更新alpha和beta参数，生成连续、上下文感知的排斥增益来增强基于欧氏距离的势场成本启发式。

Result: 仿真结果表明，Beta-Bernoulli融合在路径鲁棒性和有效性方面都带来了定性和定量的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种数值稳定的方法，能够链接多个自然命令和提示，为任何学习或经典AI框架提供集成灵活性，实现更安全、更上下文感知的机器人路径规划。

Abstract: Integrating natural language (NL) prompts into robotic mission planning has
attracted significant interest in recent years. In the construction domain,
Building Information Models (BIM) encapsulate rich NL descriptions of the
environment. We present a novel framework that fuses NL directives with
BIM-derived semantic maps via a Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian fusion by interpreting
the LLM as a sensor: each obstacle's design-time repulsive coefficient is
treated as a Beta(alpha, beta) random variable and LLM-returned danger scores
are incorporated as pseudo-counts to update alpha and beta. The resulting
posterior mean yields a continuous, context-aware repulsive gain that augments
a Euclidean-distance-based potential field for cost heuristics. By adjusting
gains based on sentiment and context inferred from user prompts, our method
guides robots along safer, more context-aware paths. This provides a
numerically stable method that can chain multiple natural commands and prompts
from construction workers and foreman to enable planning while giving
flexibility to be integrated in any learned or classical AI framework.
Simulation results demonstrate that this Beta-Bernoulli fusion yields both
qualitative and quantitative improvements in path robustness and validity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人形机器人的长时间高动态运动跟踪仍然脆弱，因为绝对关节命令无法补偿模型与实际情况的差异，导致误差累积。

Method: 使用单阶段强化学习设置，具有统一的观测、奖励和超参数配置，通过预测残差关节目标来明确纠正动力学差异。

Result: 在Unitree G1上评估，能够跟踪多分钟的高能量行为（跳跃、旋转、侧手翻），并零样本部署到硬件上，具有高运动跟踪质量。

Conclusion: RobotDancing框架能够有效解决人形机器人长时间高动态运动跟踪的问题，实现从仿真到真实环境的零样本部署。

Abstract: Long-horizon, high-dynamic motion tracking on humanoids remains brittle
because absolute joint commands cannot compensate model-plant mismatch, leading
to error accumulation. We propose RobotDancing, a simple, scalable framework
that predicts residual joint targets to explicitly correct dynamics
discrepancies. The pipeline is end-to-end--training, sim-to-sim validation, and
zero-shot sim-to-real--and uses a single-stage reinforcement learning (RL)
setup with a unified observation, reward, and hyperparameter configuration. We
evaluate primarily on Unitree G1 with retargeted LAFAN1 dance sequences and
validate transfer on H1/H1-2. RobotDancing can track multi-minute, high-energy
behaviors (jumps, spins, cartwheels) and deploys zero-shot to hardware with
high motion tracking quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SLAM在腿式机器人导航中存在快速运动、标定需求和传感器漂移等问题，且缺乏语义推理能力。需要一种不依赖SLAM、基于语义推理的导航方法。

Method: 使用分层视觉语言感知模块融合场景级和物体级信息，构建语义-概率拓扑地图，结合LLM全局推理和视觉局部规划，集成强化学习运动控制器。

Conclusion: 该工作提出了SLAM-free、视觉语言驱动的导航新范式，将机器人探索从几何中心映射转向语义驱动决策。

Abstract: Conventional SLAM pipelines for legged robot navigation are fragile under
rapid motion, calibration demands, and sensor drift, while offering limited
semantic reasoning for task-driven exploration. To deal with these issues, we
propose a vision-only, SLAM-free navigation framework that replaces dense
geometry with semantic reasoning and lightweight topological representations. A
hierarchical vision-language perception module fuses scene-level context with
object-level cues for robust semantic inference. And a semantic-probabilistic
topological map supports coarse-to-fine planning: LLM-based global reasoning
for subgoal selection and vision-based local planning for obstacle avoidance.
Integrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers, the framework is
deployable across diverse legged robot platforms. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic accuracy,
planning quality, and navigation success, while ablation studies further
showcase the necessity of both hierarchical perception and fine local planning.
This work introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven
navigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to
semantics-driven decision making.

Motivation: 传统视觉SLAM在低纹理环境、尺度模糊和挑战性视觉条件下表现不佳，而现有的基于神经网络的点云回归方法虽然能恢复高保真3D场景几何，但往往丢弃了概率多传感器信息融合的优势。

Method: 提出Sim(3)视觉对齐约束（Hessian形式）集成到通用度量尺度SE(3)因子图中，采用分层因子图设计，支持实时滑动窗口优化和具有激进闭环的全局优化。

Result: 在公共基准测试和自收集数据集上的评估表明，相比现有视觉中心的多传感器SLAM系统，在精度和鲁棒性方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: MASt3R-Fusion通过紧密集成前馈点云回归与互补传感器信息，有效克服了传统视觉SLAM的局限性，代码将开源以支持可复现性和进一步研究。

Abstract: Visual SLAM is a cornerstone technique in robotics, autonomous driving and
extended reality (XR), yet classical systems often struggle with low-texture
environments, scale ambiguity, and degraded performance under challenging
visual conditions. Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based
pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D
scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to
overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the
widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion
are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose
MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly
integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor
information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system
introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into
a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A
hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time
sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop
closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception
and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public
benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements
in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM
systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and
further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) offers a promising approach to
improve sample efficiency and generalization by training agents across multiple
tasks, enabling knowledge sharing between them. However, applying MTRL to
robotics remains challenging due to the high cost of collecting diverse task
data. To address this, we propose MT-L\'evy, a novel exploration strategy that
enhances sample efficiency in MTRL environments by combining behavior sharing
across tasks with temporally extended exploration inspired by L\'evy flight.
MT-L\'evy leverages policies trained on related tasks to guide exploration
towards key states, while dynamically adjusting exploration levels based on
task success ratios. This approach enables more efficient state-space coverage,
even in complex robotics environments. Empirical results demonstrate that
MT-L\'evy significantly improves exploration and sample efficiency, supported
by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation studies further highlight
the contribution of each component, showing that combining behavior sharing
with adaptive exploration strategies can significantly improve the practicality
of MTRL in robotics applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SemSight是一个用于多层级场景语义的概率性鸟瞰图预测模型，能够联合推断结构布局、全局场景上下文和目标区域分布，在目标驱动导航和自主探索中预测未知区域的语义信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注单个对象或几何占据地图，缺乏对房间级语义结构的建模能力，因此需要开发能够预测未知区域语义信息的模型。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器网络作为核心架构，引入掩码约束监督策略，通过在未探索区域应用二进制掩码，使监督仅关注未知区域，迫使模型从观察到的上下文中推断语义结构。

Result: 实验结果表明，SemSight提高了未探索区域关键功能类别的预测性能，在结构一致性(SC)和区域识别准确率(PA)等指标上优于非掩码监督方法，并在闭环模拟中提高了导航效率，减少了搜索目标区域的步数。

Conclusion: SemSight通过概率性语义预测模型有效提升了目标驱动导航和自主探索中的环境理解能力，证明了掩码约束监督策略在语义预测任务中的有效性。

Abstract: In target-driven navigation and autonomous exploration, reasonable prediction
of unknown regions is crucial for efficient navigation and environment
understanding. Existing methods mostly focus on single objects or geometric
occupancy maps, lacking the ability to model room-level semantic structures. We
propose SemSight, a probabilistic bird's-eye-view prediction model for
multi-level scene semantics. The model jointly infers structural layouts,
global scene context, and target area distributions, completing semantic maps
of unexplored areas while estimating probability maps for target categories. To
train SemSight, we simulate frontier-driven exploration on 2,000 indoor layout
graphs, constructing a diverse dataset of 40,000 sequential egocentric
observations paired with complete semantic maps. We adopt an encoder-decoder
network as the core architecture and introduce a mask-constrained supervision
strategy. This strategy applies a binary mask of unexplored areas so that
supervision focuses only on unknown regions, forcing the model to infer
semantic structures from the observed context. Experimental results show that
SemSight improves prediction performance for key functional categories in
unexplored regions and outperforms non-mask-supervised approaches on metrics
such as Structural Consistency (SC) and Region Recognition Accuracy (PA). It
also enhances navigation efficiency in closed-loop simulations, reducing the
number of search steps when guiding robots toward target areas.

Abstract: End-to-end robot manipulation policies offer significant potential for
enabling embodied agents to understand and interact with the world. Unlike
traditional modular pipelines, end-to-end learning mitigates key limitations
such as information loss between modules and feature misalignment caused by
isolated optimization targets. Despite these advantages, existing end-to-end
neural networks for robotic manipulation--including those based on large
VLM/VLA models--remain insufficiently performant for large-scale practical
deployment. In this paper, we take a step towards an end-to-end manipulation
policy that is generalizable, accurate and reliable. To achieve this goal, we
propose a novel Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) formulation for
robotic manipulation. Our formulation is used as the action representation of a
neural policy, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such an action
representation is general, as it extends the standard end-effector pose action
representation and supports a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a unified
manner. The oriented keypoint in our method enables natural generalization to
objects with different shapes and sizes, while achieving sub-centimeter
accuracy. Moreover, our formulation can easily handle multi-stage tasks,
multi-modal robot behaviors, and deformable objects. Extensive simulated and
hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，3B参数的MTRDrive模型达到88.3的PDMS，驾驶指标得分79.8%，规划准确率82.6%；在Roadwork-VLM基准测试中零样本泛化驾驶指标得分80.2%。

Conclusion: MTRDrive展示了在自动驾驶中实现更安全可靠系统的潜力，特别是在复杂场景下的鲁棒推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models(VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for
end-to-end autonomous driving, yet a substantial gap remains between their
current capabilities and the reliability necessary for real-world deployment. A
critical challenge is their fragility, characterized by hallucinations and poor
generalization in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MTRDrive, a novel framework that integrates procedural driving
experiences with a dynamic toolkit to enhance generalization and proactive
decision-making.
  MTRDrive addresses these limitations through a closed-loop system that
combines a memory-based experience retrieval mechanism with dynamic toolkits.
This synergy enables the model to interact more effectively with its
environment, improving both reasoning and decision-making capabilities with the
help of our memory-tool synergistic reasoning. Additionally, we introduce a new
benchmark based on complex Roadwork construction scenarios to rigorously
evaluate zero-shot generalization.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our approach.
On the public NAVSIM benchmark, our 3B-parameter MTRDrive model achieves an
exceptional PDMS of 88.3 without chain-of-thought and sets a state-of-the-art
performance bar on high-level planning, with a driving metric score of 79.8\%
and a planning accuracy of 82.6\%. Rigorous zero-shot evaluation on the new
Roadwork-VLM benchmark shows a strong ability to reason robustly in unseen
scenarios, achieving a driving metric score of 80.2\%. These results highlight
MTRDrive's potential to advance autonomous driving toward safer and more
reliable systems.

TL;DR: 本文针对可微分物理模拟器中的梯度问题，提出了一种新的接触模型，确保梯度信息的良好行为，从而改善下游应用的优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可微分物理模拟器在模型预测控制、机器人设计优化等应用中越来越重要，但其提供的梯度信息常常出现突变或消失，阻碍了基于梯度的优化器的收敛。

Method: 分析了接触模型设计对梯度行为的影响，提出了一组确保梯度信息良好行为的接触模型属性，并设计了一个满足所有这些属性且计算高效的实际接触模型。

Result: 实验表明，即使从简单初始化开始，该接触模型也能发现复杂的、接触丰富的控制信号，成功执行一系列下游运动和操作任务。

Conclusion: 通过设计满足特定属性的接触模型，可以有效解决可微分物理模拟器中的梯度问题，提升下游应用的优化性能。

Abstract: With the maturation of differentiable physics, its role in various downstream
applications: such as model predictive control, robotic design optimization,
and neural PDE solvers, has become increasingly important. However, the
derivative information provided by differentiable simulators can exhibit abrupt
changes or vanish altogether, impeding the convergence of gradient-based
optimizers. In this work, we demonstrate that such erratic gradient behavior is
closely tied to the design of contact models. We further introduce a set of
properties that a contact model must satisfy to ensure well-behaved gradient
information. Lastly, we present a practical contact model for differentiable
rigid-body simulators that satisfies all of these properties while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our experiments show that, even from simple
initializations, our contact model can discover complex, contact-rich control
signals, enabling the successful execution of a range of downstream locomotion
and manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种时间不变空间对齐（TISA）模块来解决自动驾驶中自回归模型的时空错位问题，通过将环境特征投影到一致的自我中心框架中，结合运动学动作预测头和多目标后训练阶段，在NAVSIM数据集上实现了89.8 PDMS的先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在自动驾驶端到端规划中表现出色，但其性能受到时空错位的限制——规划器必须基于过去的感知数据来预测未来动作，这导致了世界观的不一致性，限制了这种强大方法的性能上限。

Method: 1. 时间不变空间对齐（TISA）模块：学习将初始环境特征投影到每个未来时间步的一致自我中心框架中；2. 运动学动作预测头：预测加速度和偏航率以确保物理可行的轨迹；3. 多目标后训练阶段：使用直接偏好优化（DPO）提供针对特定驾驶行为的精细反馈。

Result: 在NAVSIM数据集上，该模型在自回归模型中实现了最先进的89.8 PDMS性能。

Conclusion: 通过解决时空错位问题并引入多目标优化，该方法显著提升了自动驾驶规划的性能，为自回归模型在端到端规划中的应用提供了新的方向。

Abstract: The inherent sequential modeling capabilities of autoregressive models make
them a formidable baseline for end-to-end planning in autonomous driving.
Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal
misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory
data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of
performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a
Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial
environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time
step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future
scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head
(i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories.
Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach
provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more
fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in
standard DPO. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM
dataset among autoregressive models. The video document is available at

Abstract: We address natural language pick-and-place in unseen, unpredictable indoor
environments with AnywhereVLA, a modular framework for mobile manipulation. A
user text prompt serves as an entry point and is parsed into a structured task
graph that conditions classical SLAM with LiDAR and cameras, metric semantic
mapping, and a task-aware frontier exploration policy. An approach planner then
selects visibility and reachability aware pre grasp base poses. For
interaction, a compact SmolVLA manipulation head is fine tuned on platform pick
and place trajectories for the SO-101 by TheRobotStudio, grounding local visual
context and sub-goals into grasp and place proposals. The full system runs
fully onboard on consumer-level hardware, with Jetson Orin NX for perception
and VLA and an Intel NUC for SLAM, exploration, and control, sustaining
real-time operation. We evaluated AnywhereVLA in a multi-room lab under static
scenes and normal human motion. In this setting, the system achieves a $46\%$
overall task success rate while maintaining throughput on embedded compute. By
combining a classical stack with a fine-tuned VLA manipulation, the system
inherits the reliability of geometry-based navigation with the agility and task

Motivation: 电动汽车电池拆卸需要精确的多机器人协调、短而可靠的运动轨迹，以及在杂乱动态场景中的鲁棒碰撞安全。

Method: 四层任务与运动规划框架，耦合符号任务规划和成本感知分配，使用TP-GMM引导的运动规划器从演示中学习，结合立体视觉、OctoMap 3D映射和FCL碰撞检测。

Result: 相比默认RRTConnect基线，末端执行器路径长度平均减少63.3%，总完成时间减少8.1%，单臂扫掠体积显著减小（R1: 0.583→0.139 m³; R2: 0.696→0.252 m³），相互重叠减少47%。

Conclusion: 该方法在非结构化动态环境中显著提高了多机器人电动汽车电池拆卸的自主性、精度和安全性。

Abstract: Electric-vehicle (EV) battery disassembly requires precise multi-robot
coordination, short and reliable motions, and robust collision safety in
cluttered, dynamic scenes. We propose a four-layer task-and-motion planning
(TAMP) framework that couples symbolic task planning and cost- and
accessibility-aware allocation with a TP-GMM-guided motion planner learned from
demonstrations. Stereo vision with YOLOv8 provides real-time component
localization, while OctoMap-based 3D mapping and FCL(Flexible Collision
Library) checks in MoveIt unify predictive digital-twin collision checking with
reactive, vision-based avoidance. Validated on two UR10e robots across cable,
busbar, service plug, and three leaf-cell removals, the approach yields
substantially more compact and safer motions than a default RRTConnect baseline
under identical perception and task assignments: average end-effector path
length drops by $-63.3\%$ and makespan by $-8.1\%$; per-arm swept volumes
shrink (R1: $0.583\rightarrow0.139\,\mathrm{m}^3$; R2:
$0.696\rightarrow0.252\,\mathrm{m}^3$), and mutual overlap decreases by $47\%$

TL;DR: KeyWorld是一个改进文本条件机器人世界模型的框架，通过专注于语义关键帧并使用轻量级卷积模型填充中间帧，实现了5.68倍加速并提高了生成视频的物理有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人世界模型在推理速度和生成轨迹的物理合理性方面存在瓶颈，主要源于逐帧生成方法的冗余计算和对关键转换语义重要性的忽视。

Method: 首先通过迭代简化机器人运动轨迹识别重要转换获得关键帧，然后训练DiT模型从文本任务描述生成这些物理意义关键帧，最后使用轻量级插值器高效重建完整视频。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，KeyWorld相比逐帧生成基线实现了5.68倍加速，专注于运动感知关键帧进一步提高了生成视频的物理有效性，特别是在复杂任务上。

Conclusion: 该方法为在实时机器人控制和其他需要高效有效世界模型的领域中部署世界模型提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Robotic world models are a promising paradigm for forecasting future
environment states, yet their inference speed and the physical plausibility of
generated trajectories remain critical bottlenecks, limiting their real-world
applications. This stems from the redundancy of the prevailing frame-to-frame
generation approach, where the model conducts costly computation on similar
frames, as well as neglecting the semantic importance of key transitions. To
address this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves
text-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation
on a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model
to fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies
significant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion
trajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames. Then, a DiT model is
trained to reason and generate these physically meaningful key frames from
textual task descriptions. Finally, a lightweight interpolator efficiently
reconstructs the full video by inpainting all intermediate frames. Evaluations
on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that KeyWorld achieves a 5.68$\times$
acceleration compared to the frame-to-frame generation baseline, and focusing
on the motion-aware key frames further contributes to the physical validity of
the generated videos, especially on complex tasks. Our approach highlights a
practical path toward deploying world models in real-time robotic control and
other domains requiring both efficient and effective world models. Code is

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Model
Predictive Control (MPC) framework for autonomous satellite docking with a
partially filled fuel tank. Traditional docking control faces challenges due to
fuel sloshing in microgravity, which induces unpredictable forces affecting
stability. To address this, we integrate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and
Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) RL algorithms with MPC, leveraging MPC's predictive
capabilities to accelerate RL training and improve control robustness. The
proposed approach is validated through Zero-G Lab of SnT experiments for planar
stabilization and high-fidelity numerical simulations for 6-DOF docking with
fuel sloshing dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that SAC-MPC achieves
superior docking accuracy, higher success rates, and lower control effort,
outperforming standalone RL and PPO-MPC methods. This study advances
fuel-efficient and disturbance-resilient satellite docking, enhancing the
feasibility of on-orbit refueling and servicing missions.

Abstract: The field of general purpose robotics has recently embraced powerful
probabilistic models, such as diffusion models, to model and learn complex
behaviors. However, these models often come with significant trade-offs, namely
high computational costs for inference and a fundamental inability to quantify
output uncertainty. We argue that a model's trustworthiness, a critical factor
for reliable, general-purpose robotics, is inherently linked to its ability to
provide confidence measures.
  In this work, we introduce Normalizing Flows Policy, a novel visuomotor
policy learning model based on Normalizing Flows. We show that Normalizing
Flows are a natural and powerful alternative to diffusion models, providing
both a statistically sound measure of confidence and a highly efficient
inference process. Through comprehensive experiments across four distinct
simulated robotic tasks, we demonstrate that Normalizing Flows Policy achieves
performance comparable to, and often surpassing, Diffusion Policy, and it does
so not only with improved sample efficiency but also with up to 30 times faster
inference. Additionally, our ablation study validates several key architectural
and training techniques that enable Normalizing Flows to perform well in this
domain.

Abstract: Drone-based rapid and accurate environmental edge detection is highly
advantageous for tasks such as disaster relief and autonomous navigation.
Current methods, using radars or cameras, raise deployment costs and burden
lightweight drones with high computational demands. In this paper, we propose
AirTouch, a system that transforms the ground effect from a stability "foe" in
traditional flight control views, into a "friend" for accurate and efficient
edge detection. Our key insight is that analyzing drone basic attitude sensor
readings and flight commands allows us to detect ground effect changes. Such
changes typically indicate the drone flying over a boundary of two materials,
making this information valuable for edge detection. We approach this insight
through theoretical analysis, algorithm design, and implementation, fully
leveraging the ground effect as a new sensing modality without compromising
drone flight stability, thereby achieving accurate and efficient scene edge
detection. We also compare this new sensing modality with vision-based methods
to clarify its exclusive advantages in resource efficiency and detection
capability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our system achieves a high
detection accuracy with mean detection distance errors of 0.051m, outperforming
the baseline method performance by 86%. With such detection performance, our
system requires only 43 mW power consumption, contributing to this new sensing
modality for low-cost and highly efficient edge detection.

Conclusion: CrossInstruct能够生成可执行的机器人行为，并能泛化到有限指令示例环境之外，为机器人学习提供了可扩展的替代范式。

Abstract: Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via
teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot.
While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired
behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are
difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm,
Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by
demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form
text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the
CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples
into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM
then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the
desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a
coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By
incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing
model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond
the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then
introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages
CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained
tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and
real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and
providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via
reinforcement learning.

Abstract: This paper addresses a drone ball-balancing task, in which a drone stabilizes
a ball atop a movable beam through cable-based interaction. We propose a
hierarchical control framework that decouples high-level balancing policy from
low-level drone control, and train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy to
handle the high-level decision-making. Simulation results show that the RL
policy achieves superior performance compared to carefully tuned PID
controllers within the same hierarchical structure. Through systematic
comparative analysis, we demonstrate that RL's advantage stems not from
improved parameter tuning or inherent nonlinear mapping capabilities, but from
its ability to effectively utilize richer state observations. These findings
underscore the critical role of comprehensive state representation in
learning-based systems and suggest that enhanced sensing could be instrumental
in improving controller performance.

Abstract: Multimodal agents have demonstrated strong performance in general GUI
interactions, but their application in automotive systems has been largely
unexplored. In-vehicle GUIs present distinct challenges: drivers' limited
attention, strict safety requirements, and complex location-based interaction
patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce Automotive-ENV, the first
high-fidelity benchmark and interaction environment tailored for vehicle GUIs.
This platform defines 185 parameterized tasks spanning explicit control,
implicit intent understanding, and safety-aware tasks, and provides structured
multimodal observations with precise programmatic checks for reproducible
evaluation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ASURADA, a geo-aware
multimodal agent that integrates GPS-informed context to dynamically adjust
actions based on location, environmental conditions, and regional driving
norms. Experiments show that geo-aware information significantly improves
success on safety-aware tasks, highlighting the importance of location-based
context in automotive environments. We will release Automotive-ENV, complete
with all tasks and benchmarking tools, to further the development of safe and
adaptive in-vehicle agents.

Abstract: Reliable dual-arm grasping is essential for manipulating large and complex
objects but remains a challenging problem due to stability, collision, and
generalization requirements. Prior methods typically decompose the task into
two independent grasp proposals, relying on region priors or heuristics that
limit generalization and provide no principled guarantee of stability. We
propose DAGDiff, an end-to-end framework that directly denoises to grasp pairs
in the SE(3) x SE(3) space. Our key insight is that stability and collision can
be enforced more effectively by guiding the diffusion process with classifier
signals, rather than relying on explicit region detection or object priors. To
this end, DAGDiff integrates geometry-, stability-, and collision-aware
guidance terms that steer the generative process toward grasps that are
physically valid and force-closure compliant. We comprehensively evaluate
DAGDiff through analytical force-closure checks, collision analysis, and
large-scale physics-based simulations, showing consistent improvements over
previous work on these metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework
generates dual-arm grasps directly on real-world point clouds of previously
unseen objects, which are executed on a heterogeneous dual-arm setup where two
manipulators reliably grasp and lift them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人导航系统缺乏人类导航行为（如阅读标志、询问方向），导致在大型环境中导航效率低下。

Method: 设计基于导航地标的紧凑输入输出抽象，利用视觉语言模型的语言理解和推理能力，集成人类式导航技能。

Result: 在真实和模拟导航任务中评估，智能体成功运用高阶推理在大型复杂建筑中高效导航。

Conclusion: ReasonNav证明了通过视觉语言模型集成人类导航行为可以显著提高机器人在大型环境中的导航效率。

Abstract: When navigating in a man-made environment they haven't visited before--like
an office building--humans employ behaviors such as reading signs and asking
others for directions. These behaviors help humans reach their destinations
efficiently by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot
navigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus
highly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present
ReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like
navigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a vision-language
model (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on
navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and
reasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and
show that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate
efficiently in large, complex buildings.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了几种新型多旋翼无人机配置，通过增加螺旋桨轴角度控制输入来实现全向姿态控制，解决了传统多旋翼欠驱动系统的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多旋翼无人机是欠驱动系统，无法独立控制姿态和位置，这限制了其飞行性能和应用范围。

Method: 设计了多种配置方案，增加了螺旋桨轴角度控制输入；建立了详细动力学模型并通过Simscape Multibody仿真验证；设计了滑模控制器和新型PID控制器；开发了定制控制分配策略以最小化功耗。

Result: 控制器能有效处理严重干扰和不确定性；仿真分析比较了不同配置和控制器的功耗性能；进行了不确定性对控制系统影响的定性比较。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来研究人员设计全向无人机提供了路线图，在配置选择和控制器设计方面提供了实用见解，符合Sharif AgRoLab的SAC-1项目目标。

Abstract: Conventional multi-rotors are under-actuated systems, hindering them from
independently controlling attitude from position. In this study, we present
several distinct configurations that incorporate additional control inputs for
manipulating the angles of the propeller axes. This addresses the mentioned
limitations, making the systems "omniorientational". We comprehensively derived
detailed dynamic models for all introduced configurations and validated by a
methodology using Simscape Multibody simulations. Two controllers are designed:
a sliding mode controller for robust handling of disturbances and a novel
PID-based controller with gravity compensation integrating linear and
non-linear allocators, designed for computational efficiency. A custom control
allocation strategy is implemented to manage the input-non-affine nature of
these systems, seeking to maximize battery life by minimizing the "Power
Consumption Factor" defined in this study. Moreover, the controllers
effectively managed harsh disturbances and uncertainties. Simulations compare
and analyze the proposed configurations and controllers, majorly considering
their power consumption. Furthermore, we conduct a qualitative comparison to
evaluate the impact of different types of uncertainties on the control system,
highlighting areas for potential model or hardware improvements. The analysis
in this study provides a roadmap for future researchers to design
omniorientational drones based on their design objectives, offering practical
insights into configuration selection and controller design. This research
aligns with the project SAC-1, one of the objectives of Sharif AgRoLab.

TL;DR: 提出SEEC框架，通过模型增强的残差学习和扰动生成器，实现精确稳健的末端执行器补偿，适应未见过的运动控制器而无需额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决双足机器人末端执行器稳定控制的挑战，传统模型方法依赖精确动力学建模但难以处理现实因素，学习方法容易过拟合且难以适应新场景。

Method: 模型增强的残差学习框架，结合模型引导的强化学习和扰动生成器，学习补偿下半身引起的扰动。

Result: 在不同模拟器中验证，并将训练策略迁移到Booster T1人形机器人，实验表明方法优于基线，能稳健处理多样化的运动操作任务。

Conclusion: SEEC框架能够实现精确稳健的末端执行器稳定控制，适应未见控制器且无需额外训练，在人形机器人运动操作任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Arm end-effector stabilization is essential for humanoid loco-manipulation
tasks, yet it remains challenging due to the high degrees of freedom and
inherent dynamic instability of bipedal robot structures. Previous model-based
controllers achieve precise end-effector control but rely on precise dynamics
modeling and estimation, which often struggle to capture real-world factors
(e.g., friction and backlash) and thus degrade in practice. On the other hand,
learning-based methods can better mitigate these factors via exploration and
domain randomization, and have shown potential in real-world use. However, they
often overfit to training conditions, requiring retraining with the entire
body, and still struggle to adapt to unseen scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel stable end-effector control (SEEC) framework
with model-enhanced residual learning that learns to achieve precise and robust
end-effector compensation for lower-body induced disturbances through
model-guided reinforcement learning (RL) with a perturbation generator. This
design allows the upper-body policy to achieve accurate end-effector
stabilization as well as adapt to unseen locomotion controllers with no
additional training. We validate our framework in different simulators and
transfer trained policies to the Booster T1 humanoid robot. Experiments
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and robustly
handles diverse and demanding loco-manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: FSGlove是一个基于惯性的手部动作捕捉系统，能够同时追踪48个自由度并重建个性化手部形状，通过DiffHCal校准方法实现高精度运动捕捉和形状重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有商业手套最多只能提供21个自由度，不足以捕捉复杂的手部动作，同时忽略了形状变化对接触密集型任务的重要性。

Method: 每个手指关节和手背配备IMU传感器，使用DiffHCal方法通过可微分优化与MANO参数化模型集成，在一次流线型校准中解决关节运动学、形状参数和传感器错位问题。

Result: 系统达到最先进的精度，关节角度误差小于2.7度，在形状重建和接触保真度方面优于商业替代方案。

Conclusion: FSGlove通过统一运动学和接触保真度推进了手部追踪技术，其开源硬件和软件设计确保了与当前VR和机器人生态系统的兼容性。

Abstract: Accurate hand motion capture (MoCap) is vital for applications in robotics,
virtual reality, and biomechanics, yet existing systems face limitations in
capturing high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) joint kinematics and personalized hand
shape. Commercial gloves offer up to 21 DoFs, which are insufficient for
complex manipulations while neglecting shape variations that are critical for
contact-rich tasks. We present FSGlove, an inertial-based system that
simultaneously tracks up to 48 DoFs and reconstructs personalized hand shapes
via DiffHCal, a novel calibration method. Each finger joint and the dorsum are
equipped with IMUs, enabling high-resolution motion sensing. DiffHCal
integrates with the parametric MANO model through differentiable optimization,
resolving joint kinematics, shape parameters, and sensor misalignment during a
single streamlined calibration. The system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy,
with joint angle errors of less than 2.7 degree, and outperforms commercial
alternatives in shape reconstruction and contact fidelity. FSGlove's
open-source hardware and software design ensures compatibility with current VR
and robotics ecosystems, while its ability to capture subtle motions (e.g.,
fingertip rubbing) bridges the gap between human dexterity and robotic
imitation. Evaluated against Nokov optical MoCap, FSGlove advances hand
tracking by unifying the kinematic and contact fidelity. Hardware design,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型虽然表现出色，但体积庞大、计算成本高，限制了实际部署。传统的轻量化方法往往牺牲关键能力，特别是空间推理能力。

Method: 提出RetoVLA架构，重用视觉Transformer中为去除伪影而引入但随后被丢弃的Register Tokens，将这些包含重要空间信息的tokens直接注入到动作专家模块中。

Result: 在7自由度机械臂上的实验显示，RetoVLA在复杂操作任务中的成功率实现了17.1%的绝对提升，同时保持了轻量级结构。

Conclusion: 重用Register Tokens能有效增强空间推理能力，证明之前被当作伪影丢弃的内容实际上是机器人智能的宝贵资源。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate remarkable
generalization in robotics but are restricted by their substantial size and
computational cost, limiting real-world deployment. However, conventional
lightweighting methods often sacrifice critical capabilities, particularly
spatial reasoning. This creates a trade-off between efficiency and performance.
To address this challenge, our work reuses Register Tokens, which were
introduced for artifact removal in Vision Transformers but subsequently
discarded. We suppose that these tokens contain essential spatial information
and propose RetoVLA, a novel architecture that reuses them directly by
injecting them into the Action Expert.
  RetoVLA maintains a lightweight structure while leveraging this repurposed
spatial context to enhance reasoning. We demonstrate RetoVLA's effectiveness
through a series of comprehensive experiments. On our custom-built 7-DOF robot
arm, the model achieves a 17.1%p absolute improvement in success rates for
complex manipulation tasks. Our results confirm that reusing Register Tokens
directly enhances spatial reasoning, demonstrating that what was previously
discarded as an artifact is in fact a valuable, unexplored resource for robotic
intelligence. A video demonstration is available at:

Conclusion: BiNoMaP为双手机器人非抓取式操作提供了通用解决方案，通过几何感知优化和参数化原语实现了从实例级复制到类别级泛化的突破。

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation, encompassing ungraspable actions such as
pushing, poking, and pivoting, represents a critical yet underexplored domain
in robotics due to its contact-rich and analytically intractable nature. In
this work, we revisit this problem from two novel perspectives. First, we move
beyond the usual single-arm setup and the strong assumption of favorable
external dexterity such as walls, ramps, or edges. Instead, we advocate a
generalizable dual-arm configuration and establish a suite of Bimanual
Non-prehensile Manipulation Primitives (BiNoMaP). Second, we depart from the
prevailing RL-based paradigm and propose a three-stage, RL-free framework to
learn non-prehensile skills. Specifically, we begin by extracting bimanual hand
motion trajectories from video demonstrations. Due to visual inaccuracies and
morphological gaps, these coarse trajectories are difficult to transfer
directly to robotic end-effectors. To address this, we propose a geometry-aware
post-optimization algorithm that refines raw motions into executable
manipulation primitives that conform to specific motion patterns. Beyond
instance-level reproduction, we further enable category-level generalization by
parameterizing the learned primitives with object-relevant geometric
attributes, particularly size, resulting in adaptable and general parameterized
manipulation primitives. We validate BiNoMaP across a range of representative
bimanual tasks and diverse object categories, demonstrating its effectiveness,
efficiency, versatility, and superior generalization capability.

Conclusion: GMP³框架成功解决了无人机在复杂三维环境中的动态轨迹规划问题，通过联合学习平移和旋转运动，实现了在运动学约束下的全局路径优化。

Abstract: We propose $\text{GMP}^{3}$, a multiphase global path planning framework that
generates dynamically feasible three-dimensional trajectories for unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in cluttered environments. The framework
extends traditional path planning from Euclidean position spaces to the Lie
group $\mathrm{SE}(3)$, allowing joint learning of translational motion and
rotational dynamics. A modified Bellman-based operator is introduced to support
reinforcement learning (RL) policy updates while leveraging prior trajectory
information for improved convergence. $\text{GMP}^{3}$ is designed as a
distributed framework in which agents influence each other and share policy
information along the trajectory: each agent refines its assigned segment and
shares with its neighbors via a consensus-based scheme, enabling cooperative
policy updates and convergence toward a path shaped globally even under
kinematic constraints. We also propose DroneManager, a modular ground control
software that interfaces the planner with real UAV platforms via the MAVLink
protocol, supporting real-time deployment and feedback. Simulation studies and
indoor flight experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
constrained 3D environments, demonstrating reliable obstacle avoidance and
smooth, feasible trajectories across both position and orientation. The
open-source implementation is available at

Conclusion: GPHDM成功地将层次分类学信息整合到运动生成中，生成既符合分类结构又保持物理一致性的运动序列。

Abstract: Human-like motion generation for robots often draws inspiration from
biomechanical studies, which often categorize complex human motions into
hierarchical taxonomies. While these taxonomies provide rich structural
information about how movements relate to one another, this information is
frequently overlooked in motion generation models, leading to a disconnect
between the generated motions and their underlying hierarchical structure. This
paper introduces the \ac{gphdm}, a novel approach that learns latent
representations preserving both the hierarchical structure of motions and their
temporal dynamics to ensure physical consistency. Our model achieves this by
extending the dynamics prior of the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM) to
the hyperbolic manifold and integrating it with taxonomy-aware inductive
biases. Building on this geometry- and taxonomy-aware frameworks, we propose
three novel mechanisms for generating motions that are both
taxonomically-structured and physically-consistent: two probabilistic recursive
approaches and a method based on pullback-metric geodesics. Experiments on
generating realistic motion sequences on the hand grasping taxonomy show that
the proposed GPHDM faithfully encodes the underlying taxonomy and temporal
dynamics, and generates novel physically-consistent trajectories.
