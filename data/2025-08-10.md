### [1] [RetinexDual: Retinex-based Dual Nature Approach for Generalized Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04797)
*Mohab Kishawy,Ali Abdellatif Hussein,Jun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetinexDual是一种基于Retinex理论的新型框架，用于超高清图像恢复任务，通过两个互补子网络（SAMBA和FIA）解决传统方法的局限性，并在多个任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如下采样或频域转换）在超高清图像恢复中存在信息丢失或局部性缺失的问题，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: RetinexDual框架包含两个子网络：SAMBA（用于反射分量校正）和FIA（用于频域中的颜色和光照校正）。

Result: 在去雨、去模糊、去雾和低光增强等任务中，RetinexDual在质量和数量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RetinexDual通过独特设计和多组件协同工作，显著提升了超高清图像恢复的效果。

Abstract: Advancements in image sensing have elevated the importance of
Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration (UHD IR). Traditional methods, such as
extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency
domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible
information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure
frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image
artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these
limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework
designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary
sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination
Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,
utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,
which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the
other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination
distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global
context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely
deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows
that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation
studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each
branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.

### [2] [ACM Multimedia Grand Challenge on ENT Endoscopy Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04801)
*Trong-Thuan Nguyen,Viet-Tham Huynh,Thao Thi Phuong Dao,Ha Nguyen Thi,Tien To Vu Thuy,Uyen Hanh Tran,Tam V. Nguyen,Thanh Dinh Le,Minh-Triet Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了ENTRep挑战赛，旨在通过多语言临床监督，结合细粒度解剖分类与图像检索任务，推动ENT内窥镜分析的自动化研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ENT内窥镜分析受限于设备、操作者差异及细微病变的识别，且缺乏支持案例检索的公共基准。

Method: 提出ENTRep数据集，包含专家标注的图像和双语描述，并设计了三个基准任务及标准化评估协议。

Result: 通过公开和私有测试集评估了团队表现，并报告了最佳结果。

Conclusion: ENTRep为ENT内窥镜分析提供了全面的基准，推动了相关技术的发展。

Abstract: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery is a critical yet underdeveloped
component of ENT (ear, nose, and throat) care, hindered by variability in
devices and operators, subtle and localized findings, and fine-grained
distinctions such as laterality and vocal-fold state. In addition to
classification, clinicians require reliable retrieval of similar cases, both
visually and through concise textual descriptions. These capabilities are
rarely supported by existing public benchmarks. To this end, we introduce
ENTRep, the ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge on ENT endoscopy analysis,
which integrates fine-grained anatomical classification with image-to-image and
text-to-image retrieval under bilingual (Vietnamese and English) clinical
supervision. Specifically, the dataset comprises expert-annotated images,
labeled for anatomical region and normal or abnormal status, and accompanied by
dual-language narrative descriptions. In addition, we define three benchmark
tasks, standardize the submission protocol, and evaluate performance on public
and private test splits using server-side scoring. Moreover, we report results
from the top-performing teams and provide an insight discussion.

### [3] [CoMAD: A Multiple-Teacher Self-Supervised Distillation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04816)
*Sriram Mandalika,Lalitha V*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMAD是一种轻量级、无参数的框架，通过多教师蒸馏统一自监督ViT的知识，提升紧凑学生网络的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自监督学习方法孤立预训练、模型庞大且资源消耗高的问题。

Method: 采用非对称掩码和联合共识门控，从MAE、MoCo v3和iBOT三个ViT-Base教师中蒸馏知识。

Result: ViT-Tiny在ImageNet-1K上达到75.4% Top-1，密集预测任务表现优异。

Conclusion: CoMAD在紧凑自监督蒸馏中达到新SOTA，验证了多教师蒸馏的有效性。

Abstract: Numerous self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning and
masked image modeling, learn powerful representations from unlabeled data but
are typically pretrained in isolation, overlooking complementary insights and
yielding large models that are impractical for resource-constrained deployment.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce Consensus-oriented Masked
Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies
knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision
Transformers into a compact student network. CoMAD distills from three
pretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct
semantic and contextual priors. Rather than naively averaging teacher outputs,
we apply asymmetric masking: the student sees only 25 percent of patches while
each teacher receives a progressively lighter, unique mask, forcing the student
to interpolate missing features under richer contexts. Teacher embeddings are
aligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,
then fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by
combining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained
with dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps,
capturing both local and global structure. On ImageNet-1K, CoMAD's ViT-Tiny
achieves 75.4 percent Top-1, an increment of 0.4 percent over the previous
state-of-the-art. In dense-prediction transfers, it attains 47.3 percent mIoU
on ADE20K, and 44.5 percent box average precision and 40.5 percent mask average
precision on MS-COCO, establishing a new state-of-the-art in compact SSL
distillation.

### [4] [Single-Step Reconstruction-Free Anomaly Detection and Segmentation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04818)
*Mehrdad Moradi,Marco Grasso,Bianca Maria Colosimo,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RADAR提出了一种基于注意力机制的扩散模型，用于实时无重建的异常检测，显著提升了计算效率和检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于重建的扩散模型在异常检测中存在计算成本高、重建结果不准确及噪声水平选择困难等问题。

Method: RADAR直接通过扩散模型生成异常图，避免了重建步骤，提高了效率和准确性。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和3D打印材料数据集上，RADAR在准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数上均优于现有方法，F1分数分别提升7%和13%。

Conclusion: RADAR为实时异常检测提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection
and segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged
as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and
VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on
normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a
predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The
corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse
sampling.
  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)
the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple
sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or
subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal
pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate
intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and
often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in
unsupervised settings.
  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based
diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of
reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that
reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the
diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational
efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the
MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and
statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on
MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best
model.

### [5] [A deep learning approach to track eye movements based on events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04827)
*Chirag Seth,Divya Naiken,Keyan Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究利用事件相机和深度学习技术，开发了一种低成本且高精度的眼动追踪算法，CNN_LSTM模型达到81%准确率，未来计划通过LRP提升模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速眼动（300°/s）的精确追踪通常依赖昂贵高速相机，研究旨在利用事件相机开发低成本算法，提升VR/AR设备的用户体验。

Method: 采用CNN_LSTM模型结合事件相机输入，定位眼球中心位置（x, y）。

Result: CNN_LSTM模型在预测注意力方面达到约81%的准确率。

Conclusion: 研究成功开发了低成本眼动追踪算法，未来将通过LRP进一步提升模型性能和可解释性。

Abstract: This research project addresses the challenge of accurately tracking eye
movements during specific events by leveraging previous research. Given the
rapid movements of human eyes, which can reach speeds of 300{\deg}/s, precise
eye tracking typically requires expensive and high-speed cameras. Our primary
objective is to locate the eye center position (x, y) using inputs from an
event camera. Eye movement analysis has extensive applications in consumer
electronics, especially in VR and AR product development. Therefore, our
ultimate goal is to develop an interpretable and cost-effective algorithm using
deep learning methods to predict human attention, thereby improving device
comfort and enhancing overall user experience. To achieve this goal, we
explored various approaches, with the CNN\_LSTM model proving most effective,
achieving approximately 81\% accuracy. Additionally, we propose future work
focusing on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to further enhance the
model's interpretability and predictive performance.

### [6] [LuKAN: A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Framework for 3D Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04847)
*Md Zahidul Hasan,A. Ben Hamza,Nizar Bouguila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LuKAN模型基于Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks（KANs）和Lucas多项式激活函数，通过离散小波变换和空间投影层实现高效且准确的3D人体运动预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在预测精度和计算效率之间难以平衡，需要一种更高效的模型。

Method: 使用离散小波变换编码时间信息，空间投影层捕捉关节依赖关系，KAN层结合Lucas多项式进行高效函数逼近，最后通过逆小波变换重建运动序列。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现出色，定量和定性评估均优于基线模型，同时计算效率高。

Conclusion: LuKAN模型在3D人体运动预测中实现了精度与效率的平衡，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The goal of 3D human motion prediction is to forecast future 3D poses of the
human body based on historical motion data. Existing methods often face
limitations in achieving a balance between prediction accuracy and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we present LuKAN, an effective model
based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Lucas polynomial activations.
Our model first applies the discrete wavelet transform to encode temporal
information in the input motion sequence. Then, a spatial projection layer is
used to capture inter-joint dependencies, ensuring structural consistency of
the human body. At the core of LuKAN is the Temporal Dependency Learner, which
employs a KAN layer parameterized by Lucas polynomials for efficient function
approximation. These polynomials provide computational efficiency and an
enhanced capability to handle oscillatory behaviors. Finally, the inverse
discrete wavelet transform reconstructs motion sequences in the time domain,
generating temporally coherent predictions. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model
compared to strong baselines, as evidenced by both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Moreover, its compact architecture coupled with the linear
recurrence of Lucas polynomials, ensures computational efficiency.

### [7] [VER-Bench: Evaluating MLLMs on Reasoning with Fine-Grained Visual Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04852)
*Chenhui Qiang,Zhaoyang Wei,Xumeng Han Zipeng Wang,Siyao Li,Xiangyuan Lan,Jianbin Jiao,Zhenjun Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VER-Bench是一个评估MLLMs在细粒度视觉线索识别和复杂推理能力的新框架，填补了现有基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法全面评估MLLMs对细微视觉线索的识别和复杂推理能力，而这些能力对深度视觉理解至关重要。

Method: 提出VER-Bench框架，包含374个精心设计的问题，覆盖多种推理类型，并提供结构化证据（视觉线索和相关推理）。

Result: 发现当前模型在提取细微视觉证据和构建基于证据的推理方面存在局限。

Conclusion: 需要增强模型在细粒度视觉证据提取、整合和推理方面的能力，以实现真正的视觉理解和类人分析。

Abstract: With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has
become increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main
types: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep
reasoning (e.g., "what is in the image?"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,
which concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle
clues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and
complex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local
details than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though
occupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information
for robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel
framework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,
often occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these
clues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully
designed questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System
State, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by
structured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from
them. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual
evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to
enhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction,
integration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like
analysis. Dataset and additional materials are available

*Noreen Anwar,Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau,Wassim Bouachir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAMM框架通过多模态查询和双流注意力机制，解决了Transformer检测器在遮挡、精确定位和计算效率上的问题，并在多个基准测试中取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer检测器因固定查询和密集注意力导致遮挡、精确定位和计算效率问题。

Method: 提出DAMM框架，引入三种查询（外观、位置、随机学习）和双流交叉注意力模块，分别优化语义和空间特征。

Result: 在四个基准测试中达到最佳平均精度和召回率。

Conclusion: 多模态查询适应和双流注意力机制显著提升了检测器的性能和效率。

Abstract: Transformer-based object detectors often struggle with occlusions,
fine-grained localization, and computational inefficiency caused by fixed
queries and dense attention. We propose DAMM, Dual-stream Attention with
Multi-Modal queries, a novel framework introducing both query adaptation and
structured cross-attention for improved accuracy and efficiency. DAMM
capitalizes on three types of queries: appearance-based queries from
vision-language models, positional queries using polygonal embeddings, and
random learned queries for general scene coverage. Furthermore, a dual-stream
cross-attention module separately refines semantic and spatial features,
boosting localization precision in cluttered scenes. We evaluated DAMM on four
challenging benchmarks, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance in average
precision (AP) and recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal query
adaptation and dual-stream attention. Source code is at:

*Peng Zhang,Songru Yang,Jinsheng Sun,Weiqing Li,Zhiyong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOW-Seg是一种人类参与的开世界点云语义分割框架，通过稀疏标注和层次化原型消歧机制实现高质量分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖资源密集的离线增量学习或密集标注支持数据，实用性受限。

Method: 构建查询数据的类原型，利用稀疏人类标注指导分割，引入层次化原型消歧机制和密集CRF优化标签分配。

Result: 在稀疏标注下（如每新类一点击），HOW-Seg性能与5-shot GFS-Seg相当；使用更密集标注时，在S3DIS和ScanNetv2上分别达到85.27%和66.37% mIoU。

Conclusion: HOW-Seg通过人类反馈动态优化预测，显著提升开世界点云分割性能。

Abstract: Open-world point cloud semantic segmentation (OW-Seg) aims to predict point
labels of both base and novel classes in real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or
densely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these
limitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for
OW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental
segmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias
caused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data.
By leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables
prototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the
lack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical
prototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which
correspond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual
awareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined
prototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human
feedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality
segmentation for both base and novel classes. Experiments demonstrate that with
sparse annotations (e.g., one-novel-class-one-click), HOW-Seg matches or
surpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg)
method under the 5-shot setting. When using advanced backbones (e.g.,
Stratified Transformer) and denser annotations (e.g., 10 clicks per sub-scene),
HOW-Seg achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2,
significantly outperforming alternatives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了多模态仇恨视频检测中粗粒度标注带来的标签噪声问题，通过精细标注和时间戳分析揭示了其对模型性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线多媒体内容的快速增长加剧了仇恨言论的传播，现有方法依赖视频级粗粒度标注，忽略了仇恨内容的时间粒度，导致标签噪声。

Method: 通过修剪HateMM和MultiHateClip数据集中的仇恨视频，利用时间戳隔离仇恨片段，分析其分布和特征，并进行控制实验。

Result: 实验表明时间戳噪声会改变模型决策边界并降低分类置信度，揭示了仇恨言论表达的时间依赖性和连续性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了时间感知模型和基准的必要性，以提高多模态仇恨视频检测的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online multimedia content has intensified the
spread of hate speech, presenting critical societal and regulatory challenges.
While recent work has advanced multimodal hateful video detection, most
approaches rely on coarse, video-level annotations that overlook the temporal
granularity of hateful content. This introduces substantial label noise, as
videos annotated as hateful often contain long non-hateful segments. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of such label ambiguity through a fine-grained
approach. Specifically, we trim hateful videos from the HateMM and
MultiHateClip English datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate explicitly
hateful segments. We then conduct an exploratory analysis of these trimmed
segments to examine the distribution and characteristics of both hateful and
non-hateful content. This analysis highlights the degree of semantic overlap
and the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations. Finally,
controlled experiments demonstrated that time-stamp noise fundamentally alters
model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting
the inherent context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech
expression. Our findings provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of
multimodal hateful videos and highlight the need for temporally aware models
and benchmarks for improved robustness and interpretability. Code and data are
available at

### [11] [Test-Time Adaptation for Video Highlight Detection Using Meta-Auxiliary Learning and Cross-Modality Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04924)
*Zahidul Islam,Sujoy Paul,Mrigank Rochan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Highlight-TTA是一个测试时自适应框架，通过动态调整模型以适应每个测试视频的独特特性，提升视频高光检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高光检测方法因使用固定模型而难以适应不同测试视频的多样性，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出Highlight-TTA框架，结合跨模态幻觉辅助任务，通过元辅助训练方案优化模型，并在测试时动态调整。

Result: 实验表明，Highlight-TTA显著提升了三种先进高光检测模型的性能。

Conclusion: Highlight-TTA通过测试时自适应有效解决了现有方法的泛化问题，提升了高光检测性能。

Abstract: Existing video highlight detection methods, although advanced, struggle to
generalize well to all test videos. These methods typically employ a generic
highlight detection model for each test video, which is suboptimal as it fails
to account for the unique characteristics and variations of individual test
videos. Such fixed models do not adapt to the diverse content, styles, or audio
and visual qualities present in new, unseen test videos, leading to reduced
highlight detection performance. In this paper, we propose Highlight-TTA, a
test-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that addresses
this limitation by dynamically adapting the model during testing to better
align with the specific characteristics of each test video, thereby improving
generalization and highlight detection performance. Highlight-TTA is jointly
optimized with an auxiliary task, cross-modality hallucinations, alongside the
primary highlight detection task. We utilize a meta-auxiliary training scheme
to enable effective adaptation through the auxiliary task while enhancing the
primary task. During testing, we adapt the trained model using the auxiliary
task on the test video to further enhance its highlight detection performance.
Extensive experiments with three state-of-the-art highlight detection models
and three benchmark datasets show that the introduction of Highlight-TTA to
these models improves their performance, yielding superior results.

### [12] [Extending Foundational Monocular Depth Estimators to Fisheye Cameras with Calibration Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04928)
*Suchisrit Gangopadhyay,Jung-Hee Kim,Xien Chen,Patrick Rim,Hyoungseob Park,Alex Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种方法，将基于透视图像训练的单目深度估计器（FMDEs）扩展到鱼眼图像，通过校准令牌调整潜在嵌入分布，无需重新训练或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FMDEs在相机校准参数变化时容易产生深度估计错误，需解决鱼眼图像与透视图像之间的分布差异问题。

Method: 引入校准令牌作为轻量级适配机制，调整潜在嵌入分布，利用自监督学习从公开透视图像数据集生成鱼眼图像一致性。

Result: 在室内外场景中，方法优于现有技术，仅需一组令牌即可适配多种FMDEs。

Conclusion: 通过校准令牌调整潜在嵌入分布，成功将FMDEs扩展到鱼眼图像，避免了传统方法的负面影响。

Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators
(FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being
trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate
shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion)
parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the
distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of
perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without
retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens
as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for
alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit
that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and
loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical
reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not
require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective
image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye
images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We
evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where
we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of
tokens for both. Code available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索新方法在ImageNet数据集上的表现，并分析模型性能的局限性。

Method: 使用前馈人工神经网络，结合新方法训练ImageNet 2012数据集。

Result: 模型准确率为98.3%，Top-1率为99.69%，参数规模为322,430,160。

Conclusion: 模型未达100%准确率可能源于数据集中的双标签问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a feedforward artificial neural network trained on
the ImageNet 2012 contest dataset [7] with the new method of [5] to an accuracy
rate of 98.3% with a 99.69 Top-1 rate, and an average of 285.9 labels that are
perfectly classified over the 10 batch partitions of the dataset. The best
performing model uses 322,430,160 parameters, with 4 decimal places precision.
We conjecture that the reason our model does not achieve a 100% accuracy rate
is due to a double-labeling problem, by which there are duplicate images in the
dataset with different labels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProMIM通过结合掩码图像建模（MIM）增强条件提示学习，提升零样本和小样本分类任务的泛化性能，且计算成本低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习方法（如CoOp和CoCoOp）容易过拟合已知类别，泛化能力有限。

Method: ProMIM将MIM集成到VLM流程中，通过掩码可见图像块生成实例条件提示，增强特征鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，ProMIM显著提升泛化性能，且计算成本几乎不增加。

Conclusion: ProMIM为视觉语言任务提供了一种轻量、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning but often
require resource-intensive training to adapt to new tasks. Prompt learning
techniques, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, offer efficient adaptation but tend to
overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories. We
introduce ProMIM, a plug-and-play framework that enhances conditional prompt
learning by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into existing VLM
pipelines. ProMIM leverages a simple yet effective masking strategy to generate
robust, instance-conditioned prompts, seamlessly augmenting methods like CoOp
and CoCoOp without altering their core architectures. By masking only visible
image patches and using these representations to guide prompt generation,
ProMIM improves feature robustness and mitigates overfitting, all while
introducing negligible additional computational cost. Extensive experiments
across zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks demonstrate that ProMIM
consistently boosts generalization performance when plugged into existing
approaches, providing a practical, lightweight solution for real-world
vision-language applications.

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) aims to create a scene graph for each
video frame by detecting objects and predicting their relationships. Weakly
Supervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized
scene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG
methods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo
labels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,
object-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required
for DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To
address the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we
propose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)
method, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware
dynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware
knowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that
generate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and
interactive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation
strategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the
attention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step
yields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG. (2) we
introduce a Dual-stream Fusion Module that integrates category-specific
attention maps into external detections to refine object localization and boost
confidence scores for object proposals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset. Our code
is avaliable at https://github.com/XZPKU/TRKT.git.

Method: AdvDINO在DINOv2架构中集成梯度反转层，促进领域不变特征学习，应用于非小细胞肺癌的多重免疫荧光图像。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for
learning visual representations without manual annotations. However, the
robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences
across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical
challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological
signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning
framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2
architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a
real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide
images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates
slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful
representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF
image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic
profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in
attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data,
AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology,
remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited
annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于学习不确定性的自适应高斯加权方法，用于提升稀疏视图下3D高斯溅射的渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯溅射方法在稀疏视图场景中容易过拟合，因为高斯权重处理方式单一。

Method: 通过学习不确定性自适应调整高斯权重，并结合软可微丢弃正则化优化渲染过程。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有稀疏视图方法，如PSNR提升3.27%。

Conclusion: 自适应加权方法显著提升了稀疏视图下的渲染质量，减少了高斯数量需求。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a competitive approach for novel view
synthesis (NVS) due to its advanced rendering efficiency through 3D Gaussian
projection and blending. However, Gaussians are treated equally weighted for
rendering in most 3DGS methods, making them prone to overfitting, which is
particularly the case in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we investigate
how adaptive weighting of Gaussians affects rendering quality, which is
characterised by learned uncertainties proposed. This learned uncertainty
serves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian
opacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty
undergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically
transforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that
govern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering.
Extensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher
quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to
existing sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method
achieves 3.27\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.

Result: 实验结果表明，改进方法在质量与成本权衡上表现更优，平均精度和召回率均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 可变画布帧和可选帧率的设计显著提升了边缘平台上物体检测的性能。

Abstract: Real-time perception on edge platforms faces a core challenge: executing
high-resolution object detection under stringent latency constraints on limited
computing resources. Canvas-based attention scheduling was proposed in earlier
work as a mechanism to reduce the resource demands of perception subsystems. It
consolidates areas of interest in an input data frame onto a smaller area,
called a canvas frame, that can be processed at the requisite frame rate. This
paper extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling literature by (i)
allowing for variable-size canvas frames and (ii) employing selectable canvas
frame rates that may depart from the original data frame rate. We evaluate our
solution by running YOLOv11, as the perception module, on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin
Nano to inspect video frames from the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that
the additional degrees of freedom improve the attainable quality/cost
trade-offs, thereby allowing for a consistently higher mean average precision
(mAP) and recall with respect to the state of the art.

Result: SODEC在速率-失真-感知性能上显著优于现有方法，解码速度提升超过20倍。

Conclusion: SODEC通过单步解码和保真度优化，有效解决了扩散图像压缩的瓶颈问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has demonstrated impressive perceptual
performance. However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive
decoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting
from over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose
SODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in
image compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step
refinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained
VAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the
iterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve
fidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is
faithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing
training strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates.
Extensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover,
compared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves
decoding speed by more than 20$\times$. Code is released at:

Motivation: 现有基于学习的深度补全模型在分布外（OOD）场景中性能显著下降，而基础模型在大规模训练中表现出色，因此探索如何利用基础模型提升深度补全的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过深度基础模型从RGB图像中提取环境线索（结构和语义上下文），设计无参数的双空间传播方法（3D和2D空间），并引入可学习的校正模块逐步调整预测深度。

Result: 在NYUv2和KITTI数据集上训练，并在16个其他数据集上评估，模型在OOD场景中表现优异，优于现有最先进的深度补全方法。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了深度补全的鲁棒性，无需依赖大规模训练，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Depth completion is a pivotal challenge in computer vision, aiming at
reconstructing the dense depth map from a sparse one, typically with a paired
RGB image. Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but
limited data, leading to significant performance degradation in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated
exceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale
training, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion
models is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth
completion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain
remarkable robustness without large-scale training. Specifically, we leverage a
depth foundation model to extract environmental cues, including structural and
semantic context, from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth
information into missing regions. We further design a dual-space propagation
approach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse
depth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local
consistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable
correction module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real
depth. We train our model on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets as in-distribution
datasets and extensively evaluate the framework on 16 other datasets. Our
framework performs remarkably well in the OOD scenarios and outperforms
existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods. Our models are released in

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种设置下性能提升高达9%，计算效率提升9倍。

Conclusion: 模态分离框架有效解决了模态间隙问题，显著提升了无监督域适应的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables models trained on a labeled
source domain to handle new unlabeled domains. Recently, pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance
by leveraging semantic information to facilitate target tasks. By aligning
vision and text embeddings, VLMs have shown notable success in bridging domain
gaps. However, inherent differences naturally exist between modalities, which
is known as modality gap. Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence
of modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to
suboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified
modality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and
modality-invariant components. During training, different modality components
are disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.
At test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined
to maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level
modality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize
samples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones. The
modality-invariant samples are exploited to facilitate cross-modal alignment,
while uncertain ones are annotated to enhance model capabilities. Building upon
prompt tuning techniques, our methods achieve up to 9% performance gain with 9
times of computational efficiencies. Extensive experiments and analysis across
various backbones, baselines, datasets and adaptation settings demonstrate the
efficacy of our design.

Motivation: 探索快速学习如何通过快速权重机制在深度神经网络中引入全局上下文敏感性。

Method: 使用Vision Transformer（ViT）自编码器，结合Low-Rank Adaptation（LoRA）实现快速权重，分析熟悉性训练对网络的影响。

Result: ViT自编码器的自注意力机制模拟神经回路；熟悉性训练使早期层与顶层表征对齐，并扩大自注意力范围；LoRA显著增强这些效果。

Conclusion: 熟悉性训练在分层网络中引入全局敏感性，快速权重架构为研究大脑快速学习提供了计算模型。

Abstract: Recent neurophysiological studies have revealed that the early visual cortex
can rapidly learn global image context, as evidenced by a sparsification of
population responses and a reduction in mean activity when exposed to familiar
versus novel image contexts. This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to
local recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback
pathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.
Recurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown
to reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and
invariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision
Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional
perspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context
in the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid
learning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory
traces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such
fast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The
proposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold
transform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)
Familiarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those
in the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity
training broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.
(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.
Together, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global
sensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid
fast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for
studying rapid global context learning in the brain.

Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型在遮挡场景中因忽视细粒度属性信息而表现不佳，需要一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：首先生成属性伪标签捕捉细微视觉特征，然后通过双引导机制结合整体和细粒度信息增强特征提取。

Result: 在多个广泛使用的Re-ID数据集上达到最先进水平，显著提升了遮挡和细微差异的处理能力。

Conclusion: AG-ReID框架有效解决了遮挡和细微属性差异问题，同时保持了标准Re-ID场景的竞争力。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match person images across different
camera views, with occluded Re-ID addressing scenarios where pedestrians are
partially visible. While pre-trained vision-language models have shown
effectiveness in Re-ID tasks, they face significant challenges in occluded
scenarios by focusing on holistic image semantics while neglecting fine-grained
attribute information. This limitation becomes particularly evident when
dealing with partially occluded pedestrians or when distinguishing between
individuals with subtle appearance differences. To address this limitation, we
propose Attribute-Guide ReID (AG-ReID), a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained models' inherent capabilities to extract fine-grained semantic
attributes without additional data or annotations. Our framework operates
through a two-stage process: first generating attribute pseudo-labels that
capture subtle visual characteristics, then introducing a dual-guidance
mechanism that combines holistic and fine-grained attribute information to
enhance image feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AG-ReID achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple widely-used Re-ID
datasets, showing significant improvements in handling occlusions and subtle
attribute differences while maintaining competitive performance on standard
Re-ID scenarios.

Motivation: 视频持续学习面临高内存需求挑战，尤其是长视频和连续流数据。本文旨在通过压缩存储视频编码来解决这一问题，同时避免依赖预训练网络。

Method: 采用基于排练的方法，存储视频编码而非原始数据，并提出刷新视频编码的方案以应对灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在EpicKitchens-100和Kinetics-700等大规模数据集上，CRAM方法显著减少了内存占用（低于2GB），并优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CRAM通过压缩存储和刷新编码，有效解决了视频持续学习中的内存和遗忘问题，为实际部署提供了可行性。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) promises to allow neural networks to learn from
continuous streams of inputs, instead of IID (independent and identically
distributed) sampling, which requires random access to a full dataset. This
would allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of
deployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to
biological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,
which reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the
reason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of
video, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at
odds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we
propose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead
of raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling
buffer. Training a video compressor online (so not depending on any pre-trained
networks) means that it is also subject to catastrophic forgetting. We propose
a scheme to deal with this forgetting by refreshing video codes, which requires
careful decompression with a previous version of the network and recompression
with a new one. We name our method Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM).
We expand current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings, namely
EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, storing thousands of relatively long videos
in under 2 GB, and demonstrate empirically that our video CL method outperforms
prior art with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

Motivation: 医学图像数据复杂多变，传统视觉语言模型在领域泛化上表现不佳。

Method: MCDRL分两步：1) 利用CLIP识别病灶区域并构建领域变化字典；2) 训练因果干预网络消除领域变化影响。

Result: 实验表明MCDRL在分割准确性和泛化性上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: MCDRL有效提升医学图像分割的领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot capabilities in various computer vision tasks. However, their
application to medical imaging remains challenging due to the high variability
and complexity of medical data. Specifically, medical images often exhibit
significant domain shifts caused by various confounders, including equipment
differences, procedure artifacts, and imaging modes, which can lead to poor
generalization when models are applied to unseen domains. To address this
limitation, we propose Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning
(MCDRL), a novel framework that integrates causal inference with the VLM to
tackle domain generalization in medical image segmentation. MCDRL is
implemented in two steps: first, it leverages CLIP's cross-modal capabilities
to identify candidate lesion regions and construct a confounder dictionary
through text prompts, specifically designed to represent domain-specific
variations; second, it trains a causal intervention network that utilizes this
dictionary to identify and eliminate the influence of these domain-specific
variations while preserving the anatomical structural information critical for
segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCDRL consistently
outperforms competing methods, yielding superior segmentation accuracy and
exhibiting robust generalizability.

Conclusion: AU-IQA数据集为AI-UGC质量评估提供了基准，推动了该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: AI-based image enhancement techniques have been widely adopted in various
visual applications, significantly improving the perceptual quality of
user-generated content (UGC). However, the lack of specialized quality
assessment models has become a significant limiting factor in this field,
limiting user experience and hindering the advancement of enhancement methods.
While perceptual quality assessment methods have shown strong performance on
UGC and AIGC individually, their effectiveness on AI-enhanced UGC (AI-UGC)
which blends features from both, remains largely unexplored. To address this
gap, we construct AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset comprising 4,800 AI-UGC images
produced by three representative enhancement types which include
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, and denoising. On this dataset, we
further evaluate a range of existing quality assessment models, including
traditional IQA methods and large multimodal models. Finally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of how well current approaches perform in assessing the
perceptual quality of AI-UGC. The access link to the AU-IQA is

Method: 提出skin-SOAP框架，利用弱监督多模态方法，结合病变图像和稀疏临床文本生成结构化SOAP笔记。

Result: 在临床相关性指标上与GPT-4o、Claude和DeepSeek Janus Pro表现相当，并引入MedConceptEval和CCS两个新指标评估临床相关性。

Conclusion: skin-SOAP框架能有效生成临床相关的SOAP笔记，减轻医生负担，减少对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. Early diagnosis, accurate
and timely treatment are critical to improving patient survival rates. In
clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP
(Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually
generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.
In this work, we propose skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework to
generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion
images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual
annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while
alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data.
Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek
Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate this clinical
relevance, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence
Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and
input features, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的图像质量评估方法SCSSIM，专注于场景构图结构（SCS）的完整性，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI模型的快速发展需要超越人类感知的图像质量评估方法，尤其是SCS的保持。传统方法在评估SCS时存在不足。

Method: SCSSIM是一种无需训练的解析性指标，利用图像的立方体层次分区统计量来量化SCS的保持。

Result: SCSSIM对非构图失真具有高不变性，对构图失真表现出单调递减，优于现有指标。

Conclusion: SCSSIM是评估生成模型场景构图完整性的有力工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for
evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical
concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene
Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among
objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc.
Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally
accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short
in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual
noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal,
neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent
neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential
generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM),
a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation
by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical
partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural
relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to
non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely,
it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely
indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM
exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable
tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of
scene composition.

Abstract: Recently, research interest in person re-identification (ReID) has
increasingly focused on video-based scenarios, which are essential for robust
surveillance and security in varied and dynamic environments. However, existing
video-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and
selecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery
pair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework,
which leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g.,
CLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently
modeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic
gait--and adaptively integrating them. Specifically, HAMoBE includes two
levels: the first level extracts low-level features from multi-layer
representations provided by the frozen large model, while the second level
consists of specialized experts focusing on long-term, short-term, and temporal
features. To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision
gating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based
on their relevance to the input scenarios. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks
like MEVID demonstrate that our approach yields significant performance
improvements (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).

TL;DR: 论文提出了NiM基准和Spot-IT方法，用于评估和改进多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂文档中定位和推理细粒度细节的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在文档理解任务中表现优异，但在处理复杂文档中的细粒度细节（如菜单中的营养信息或长文中的免责声明）时能力不足。

Method: 引入NiM基准测试集，并提出Spot-IT方法，通过智能补丁选择和高斯注意力机制模拟人类搜索文档时的聚焦行为。

Result: 实验表明Spot-IT在复杂布局的细粒度细节提取任务中显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Spot-IT有效提升了MLLMs在细粒度文档理解任务中的表现，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in document understanding tasks, their ability to locate and
reason about fine-grained details within complex documents remains
understudied. Consider searching a restaurant menu for a specific nutritional
detail or identifying a disclaimer in a lengthy newspaper article tasks that
demand careful attention to small but significant details within a broader
narrative, akin to Finding Needles in Images (NiM). To address this gap, we
introduce NiM, a carefully curated benchmark spanning diverse real-world
documents including newspapers, menus, and lecture images, specifically
designed to evaluate MLLMs' capability in these intricate tasks. Building on
this, we further propose Spot-IT, a simple yet effective approach that enhances
MLLMs capability through intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention,
motivated from how humans zoom and focus when searching documents. Our
extensive experiments reveal both the capabilities and limitations of current
MLLMs in handling fine-grained document understanding tasks, while
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Spot-IT achieves significant
improvements over baseline methods, particularly in scenarios requiring precise
detail extraction from complex layouts.

TL;DR: DualMat是一种双路径扩散框架，用于从复杂光照条件下的单张图像估计基于物理的渲染（PBR）材料。通过两种潜在空间路径和特征蒸馏，结合整流流技术提升效率，并在高分辨率与多视图输入中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单张图像估计PBR材料在复杂光照条件下具有挑战性，现有方法难以同时优化反照率和金属粗糙度。

Method: 采用双路径潜在空间（反照率优化路径和材料专用路径），引入特征蒸馏和整流流技术，支持高分辨率和多视图输入。

Result: 在Objaverse和真实数据上达到SOTA性能，反照率估计提升28%，金属粗糙度预测误差降低39%。

Conclusion: DualMat通过双路径设计和特征蒸馏，显著提升了PBR材料估计的精度和效率。

Abstract: We present DualMat, a novel dual-path diffusion framework for estimating
Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials from single images under complex
lighting conditions. Our approach operates in two distinct latent spaces: an
albedo-optimized path leveraging pretrained visual knowledge through RGB latent
space, and a material-specialized path operating in a compact latent space
designed for precise metallic and roughness estimation. To ensure coherent
predictions between the albedo-optimized and material-specialized paths, we
introduce feature distillation during training. We employ rectified flow to
enhance efficiency by reducing inference steps while maintaining quality. Our
framework extends to high-resolution and multi-view inputs through patch-based
estimation and cross-view attention, enabling seamless integration into
image-to-3D pipelines. DualMat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
Objaverse and real-world data, significantly outperforming existing methods
with up to 28% improvement in albedo estimation and 39% reduction in
metallic-roughness prediction errors.

TL;DR: DecoupleCSS提出了一种两阶段框架，通过解耦类别感知检测和类别无关分割，解决了持续语义分割中的灾难性遗忘问题，实现了保留旧知识的同时学习新类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续语义分割方法通常采用单阶段编码器-解码器架构，导致新旧类别学习干扰和次优的保留-可塑性平衡。

Method: DecoupleCSS分为两阶段：第一阶段使用预训练文本和图像编码器生成位置感知提示；第二阶段利用Segment Anything Model（SAM）生成精确分割掩码。

Result: 该方法在多种挑战性任务中实现了保留与适应性的平衡，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DecoupleCSS通过解耦检测与分割，显著提升了持续语义分割的效果。

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) requires learning new classes without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, addressing the fundamental challenge
of catastrophic forgetting in dense prediction tasks. However, existing CSS
methods typically employ single-stage encoder-decoder architectures where
segmentation masks and class labels are tightly coupled, leading to
interference between old and new class learning and suboptimal
retention-plasticity balance. We introduce DecoupleCSS, a novel two-stage
framework for CSS. By decoupling class-aware detection from class-agnostic
segmentation, DecoupleCSS enables more effective continual learning, preserving
past knowledge while learning new classes. The first stage leverages
pre-trained text and image encoders, adapted using LoRA, to encode
class-specific information and generate location-aware prompts. In the second
stage, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is employed to produce precise
segmentation masks, ensuring that segmentation knowledge is shared across both
new and previous classes. This approach improves the balance between retention
and adaptability in CSS, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a
variety of challenging tasks. Our code is publicly available at:

Result: 未明确提及具体结果，但强调了方法的改进潜力。

Conclusion: 分类和对抗学习方法有望解决图像着色中的多模态问题。

Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been
the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years
for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic
animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it
is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in
large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the
surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically
blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and
there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors
since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores
the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore
automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We
will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific
scenario and make comparisons.

Motivation: 现有GAN和扩散模型方法依赖额外组件或损失函数，可能引入误差，导致效果不佳。

Method: 基于FLUX-Kontext框架，引入RefLoRAInjector轻量化特征注入器，并设计高效数据生成流程。

Result: 实验表明FLUX-Makeup在多样场景中表现鲁棒，性能领先。

Conclusion: FLUX-Makeup通过简化框架和高效数据生成，实现了高质量的化妆迁移。

Abstract: Makeup transfer aims to apply the makeup style from a reference face to a
target face and has been increasingly adopted in practical applications.
Existing GAN-based approaches typically rely on carefully designed loss
functions to balance transfer quality and facial identity consistency, while
diffusion-based methods often depend on additional face-control modules or
algorithms to preserve identity. However, these auxiliary components tend to
introduce extra errors, leading to suboptimal transfer results. To overcome
these limitations, we propose FLUX-Makeup, a high-fidelity,
identity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer framework that eliminates the
need for any auxiliary face-control components. Instead, our method directly
leverages source-reference image pairs to achieve superior transfer
performance. Specifically, we build our framework upon FLUX-Kontext, using the
source image as its native conditional input. Furthermore, we introduce
RefLoRAInjector, a lightweight makeup feature injector that decouples the
reference pathway from the backbone, enabling efficient and comprehensive
extraction of makeup-related information. In parallel, we design a robust and
scalable data generation pipeline to provide more accurate supervision during
training. The paired makeup datasets produced by this pipeline significantly
surpass the quality of all existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong
robustness across diverse scenarios.

Motivation: 病理基础模型（PFMs）的预训练环境多样且不透明，导致潜在偏差，影响下游应用的泛化性和透明度。

Method: 提出AdaFusion框架，动态集成多个PFMs的知识，压缩和对齐特征，并使用轻量级注意力机制自适应融合。

Result: 在三个真实世界基准测试中，AdaFusion在分类和回归任务中均优于单个PFM，并提供模型生物语义特化的可解释性。

Conclusion: AdaFusion能够桥接异构PFMs，提升性能和模型特定归纳偏差的可解释性。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational
capabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated
histopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining
contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors,
introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in
downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel
prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very
first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our
method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and
employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on
tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks
spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene
expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs
across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable
insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight
AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced
performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.

TL;DR: PoseGen是一种新框架，通过单张参考图像和驱动姿势序列生成任意长度的视频，解决了扩散模型在身份漂移和短片段限制上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在生成长视频时存在身份漂移和片段限制的问题，需要一种能保持身份一致性和精确控制运动的方法。

Method: 采用in-context LoRA微调策略，在token级别注入主题外观以保持身份，同时在通道级别条件化姿势信息以控制运动。通过分段生成和共享KV缓存机制实现无缝拼接。

Result: 在仅33小时视频数据集上训练，PoseGen在身份保真度、姿势准确性和生成无限长度视频能力上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PoseGen通过创新的微调和分段生成方法，成功解决了长视频生成中的身份漂移和片段限制问题。

Abstract: Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject
identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models,
which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We
introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of
a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence.
Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects
subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while
simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for
fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an
interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips
together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition
process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a
remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose
accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of
unlimited duration.

TL;DR: SMP方法通过整合不同阶段的边缘惩罚，解决了Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning中基类与新类的平衡问题，提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中数据隐私和获取成本高，导致增量任务中训练数据不足，性能下降。现有方法难以平衡基类区分和新类泛化。

Method: 提出SMP方法，包括MIAM机制（基任务学习）和MPCC策略（增量任务），通过边缘惩罚优化分类器。

Result: 在CIFAR100、ImageNet-R和CUB200上，SMP实现了最先进的性能，并平衡了基类与新类。

Conclusion: SMP为FSCIL提供了一种有效的解决方案，显著提升了性能与平衡性。

Abstract: Real-world applications often face data privacy constraints and high
acquisition costs, making the assumption of sufficient training data in
incremental tasks unrealistic and leading to significant performance
degradation in class-incremental learning. Forward-compatible learning, which
prospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged
as a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL).
However, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability
and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during
incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries.
To address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel
FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages
within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce
the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task
learning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct
classification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class
discriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote
generalization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged
to improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin
Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision
boundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a
margin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200
demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while
maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多实例学习（MIL）在处理千兆像素全切片图像（WSI）时的高计算成本问题。

Method: 提出AHDMIL框架，包含动态多实例网络（DMIN）和双分支轻量级实例预筛选网络（DB-LIPN），通过自蒸馏和不对称蒸馏两阶段训练筛选无关补丁。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上，AHDMIL在分类性能和推理速度上均优于现有方法，例如在Camelyon16上准确率提升5.3%，推理速度加快1.2倍。

Conclusion: AHDMIL通过高效补丁筛选和新型CKA分类器，实现了病理图像分类的高效与高精度。

Abstract: Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image
classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to the need
to process thousands of patches from each gigapixel whole slide image (WSI). To
address this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation
Multi-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification
by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL
comprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which
operates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance
Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution
counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for
WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify
irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation
(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution
patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence
with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and
efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first
Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational
pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable
activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate
that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both
classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16
dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates
inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC),
accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average
inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times. The code is available.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖单一文本输入，无法充分利用视觉细节，易导致相似对象误识别。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有RIS和REC方法，并在GRES基准上表现优异。

Conclusion: 多潜在表达框架能有效捕捉视觉细节，显著提升视觉定位任务性能。

Abstract: Visual grounding tasks, such as referring image segmentation (RIS) and
referring expression comprehension (REC), aim to localize a target object based
on a given textual description. The target object in an image can be described
in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and
more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which
captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual
domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can
lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a
novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions
generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual
details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce
subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both
shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent
representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We
also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all
latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations.
Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art
RIS and REC approaches on multiple benchmarks but also achieves outstanding
performance on the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES)
benchmark.

Result: 在有限数据场景中，FedGIN性能提升12-18%；在完整数据场景中，接近集中式性能，Dice分数显著提高。

Conclusion: FedGIN在多模态分割中表现优异，具有隐私保护能力，适用于临床工作流。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics,
surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation
models are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision
making across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in
image characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of
generalizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.
This model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for
modality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major
challenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT
vs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these
issues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables
multimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method
integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module
that harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local
training. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset
and a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was
initially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its
performance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT
data were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data
scenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test
cases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.
In the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized
performance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a
10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong
cross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.

Abstract: Assessing chronic pain behavior in mice is critical for preclinical studies.
However, existing methods mostly rely on manual labeling of behavioral
features, and humans lack a clear understanding of which behaviors best
represent chronic pain. For this reason, existing methods struggle to
accurately capture the insidious and persistent behavioral changes in chronic
pain. This study proposes a framework to automatically discover features
related to chronic pain without relying on human-defined action labels. Our
method uses universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse
action features, and avoids the potential bias of human labeling by retaining
the rich behavioral information in the original video. In this paper, we also
collected a mouse pain behavior dataset that captures the disease progression
of both neuropathic and inflammatory pain across multiple time points. Our
method achieves 48.41\% accuracy in a 15-class pain classification task,
significantly outperforming human experts (21.33\%) and the widely used method
B-SOiD (30.52\%). Furthermore, when the classification is simplified to only
three categories, i.e., neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and no pain, then
our method achieves an accuracy of 73.1\%, which is notably higher than that of
human experts (48\%) and B-SOiD (58.43\%). Finally, our method revealed
differences in drug efficacy for different types of pain on zero-shot
Gabapentin drug testing, and the results were consistent with past drug
efficacy literature. This study demonstrates the potential clinical application
of our method, which can provide new insights into pain research and related
drug development.

<details>

Motivation: 低分辨率图像中的几何图案（如重复纹理、边缘或形状）容易变形，导致超分辨率恢复时出现伪影。旋转等变性能够保持原始方向和结构完整性，因此需要将其嵌入ASISR网络。

Method: 重新设计编码器和INR模块，引入旋转等变能力，并通过理论分析评估其内在等变误差。

Result: 实验证明该方法在模拟和真实数据集上表现优越，并能以即插即用方式提升现有ASISR方法的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的旋转等变ASISR方法有效解决了几何图案变形问题，为超分辨率任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR), a recent popular topic in
computer vision, aims to achieve arbitrary-scale high-resolution recoveries
from a low-resolution input image. This task is realized by representing the
image as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a
deep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.
Despite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly
ill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive
textures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the
low-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in
their high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the
ASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this
enhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original
orientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the
input image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation
equivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign
the basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic
rotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.
Through such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be
implemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to
output. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic
equivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an
equivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated
by experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate
that the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR
methods in a plug \& play manner to further enhance their performance.

Result: 在UniMo4D数据集上，X-MoGen在已知和未知物种上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: X-MoGen通过统一框架和形态一致性模块，实现了跨物种文本驱动运动生成的高效性和普适性。

Abstract: Text-driven motion generation has attracted increasing attention due to its
broad applications in virtual reality, animation, and robotics. While existing
methods typically model human and animal motion separately, a joint
cross-species approach offers key advantages, such as a unified representation
and improved generalization. However, morphological differences across species
remain a key challenge, often compromising motion plausibility. To address
this, we propose \textbf{X-MoGen}, the first unified framework for
cross-species text-driven motion generation covering both humans and animals.
X-MoGen adopts a two-stage architecture. First, a conditional graph variational
autoencoder learns canonical T-pose priors, while an autoencoder encodes motion
into a shared latent space regularized by morphological loss. In the second
stage, we perform masked motion modeling to generate motion embeddings
conditioned on textual descriptions. During training, a morphological
consistency module is employed to promote skeletal plausibility across species.
To support unified modeling, we construct \textbf{UniMo4D}, a large-scale
dataset of 115 species and 119k motion sequences, which integrates human and
animal motions under a shared skeletal topology for joint training. Extensive
experiments on UniMo4D demonstrate that X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both seen and unseen species.

Result: 实验表明PhysPatch在攻击效果和现实适用性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PhysPatch为MLLM自动驾驶系统提供了高效且物理可行的对抗攻击解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming integral to autonomous
driving (AD) systems due to their strong vision-language reasoning
capabilities. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in
real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily
designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to
MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically
realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based
AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to
enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a
semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an
SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve
transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive
experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs
demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering
MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs.
Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically
feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and
deployability.

Motivation: 现实场景中，未见类别的目标常因低置信度检测、弱运动与外观约束及长期遮挡导致跟踪困难。

Method: MTT框架通过短时空相关性自适应聚类检测结果生成鲁棒轨迹，并利用位置和外观等多线索估计最佳轨迹分区以减少长期关联中的误差传播。

Result: 在通用多目标跟踪基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: MTT框架在解决未见类别目标跟踪问题上具有竞争力。

Abstract: Tracking specific targets, such as pedestrians and vehicles, has been the
focus of recent vision-based multitarget tracking studies. However, in some
real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to
low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and
long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a
tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates
flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This
framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their
short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates
the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and
appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association.
Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object
tracking demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source
domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain under domain shifts.
Most prior works focus on capturing the inter-domain transferability but
largely overlook rich intra-domain structures, which empirically results in
even worse discriminability. To tackle this tradeoff, we propose a generalized
graph SPectral Alignment framework, SPA++. Its core is briefly condensed as
follows: (1)-by casting the DA problem to graph primitives, it composes a
coarse graph alignment mechanism with a novel spectral regularizer toward
aligning the domain graphs in eigenspaces; (2)-we further develop a
fine-grained neighbor-aware propagation mechanism for enhanced discriminability
in the target domain; (3)-by incorporating data augmentation and consistency
regularization, SPA++ can adapt to complex scenarios including most DA settings
and even challenging distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we also provide
theoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound
of graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently
outperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and
adaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.

Conclusion: SPEX是首个专注于光谱遥感图像地物提取的多模态模型，兼具高精度和可解释性。

Abstract: Spectral information has long been recognized as a critical cue in remote
sensing observations. Although numerous vision-language models have been
developed for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains
underutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in
multispectral scenarios. To address this limitation, we construct a
vision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes
spectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by
large language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations.
Leveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for
instruction-driven land cover extraction. To this end, we introduce several
carefully designed components and training strategies, including multiscale
feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual
pre-training, to achieve precise and flexible pixel-level interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, SPEX is the first multimodal vision-language model
dedicated to land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing imagery.
Extensive experiments on five public multispectral datasets demonstrate that
SPEX consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in extracting
typical land cover categories such as vegetation, buildings, and water bodies.
Moreover, SPEX is capable of generating textual explanations for its
predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and user-friendliness. Code

TL;DR: EndoMatcher提出了一种通用的内窥镜图像匹配方法，通过大规模多域数据预训练解决纹理弱、视角变化大和数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜图像中的通用密集特征匹配对机器人辅助任务至关重要，但视觉条件困难（如弱纹理、大视角变化）和标注数据稀缺是主要挑战。

Method: EndoMatcher采用双分支Vision Transformer提取多尺度特征，并通过双交互块增强对应学习；构建Endo-Mix6多域数据集，采用渐进多目标训练策略。

Result: 在零样本匹配实验中，EndoMatcher在Hamlyn和Bladder数据集上的内点匹配数分别提高了140.69%和201.43%，在Gastro-Matching数据集上的MDPA提高了9.40%。

Conclusion: EndoMatcher在挑战性内窥镜条件下实现了密集且准确的匹配，具有跨器官和成像条件的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images is crucial for
robot-assisted tasks, including 3D reconstruction, navigation, and surgical
scene understanding. Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual
conditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of
annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a
generalizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data
pre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a
two-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual
interaction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data
scarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first
multi-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of
approximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with
correspondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated
transformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges
in training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,
distribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive
multi-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and
improve representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to
generalize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.
Extensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases
the number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder
datasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching
Direction Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset,
achieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.

Conclusion: VFlowOpt为多模态模型提供高效修剪方案，显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging
numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token
redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed
at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps
derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language
tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this
progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and
insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance
degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that
introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning
module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy
are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,
we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived
context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which
tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to
avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information
flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most
representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the
discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,
thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.
Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while
maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache
memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了跨域少样本分割的挑战，同时避免了源域数据的使用。

Abstract: Few-Shot Segmentation(FSS) aims to efficient segmentation of new objects with
few labeled samples. However, its performance significantly degrades when
domain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain
Few-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance
degradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation
models on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,
driven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize
data transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS
approaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS
method that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target
domain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we
first append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of
a pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the
shared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the
TSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and
a Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes
global-local visual features to align image features across different views,
while the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal
features (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the
outputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent
fusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks.
Under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average
segmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\% and 4.11\%, respectively, across
four cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS
methods. Code are available at https://github.com/ljm198134/TVGTANet.

Conclusion: ReasoningTrack框架显著提升了视觉语言跟踪的性能，为任务提供了新基准。

Abstract: Vision-language tracking has received increasing attention in recent years,
as textual information can effectively address the inflexibility and inaccuracy
associated with specifying the target object to be tracked. Existing works
either directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify
using attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some
researchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in
the target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into
the model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large
models, which further limits their overall performance. To address the
aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based
vision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a
pre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
and reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and
language generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them
into a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then,
we adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object.
In addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking
benchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20
baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which
builds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task.
Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets
fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural
language generation strategy. The source code of this paper will be released on

Abstract: Segmenting gas bubbles in multiphase flows is a critical yet unsolved
challenge in numerous industrial settings, from metallurgical processing to
maritime drag reduction. Traditional approaches-and most recent learning-based
methods-assume near-spherical shapes, limiting their effectiveness in regimes
where bubbles undergo deformation, coalescence, or breakup. This complexity is
particularly evident in air lubrication systems, where coalesced bubbles form
amorphous and topologically diverse patches. In this work, we revisit the
problem through the lens of modern vision foundation models. We cast the task
as a transfer learning problem and demonstrate, for the first time, that a
fine-tuned Segment Anything Model SAM v2.1 can accurately segment highly
non-convex, irregular bubble structures using as few as 100 annotated images.

Conclusion: MELLA数据集通过增强文化知识和语言能力，有效提升了MLLM在低资源语言中的表现。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
high-resource languages. However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly
in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement
methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine
translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic
capabilities and produce "thin descriptions", they neglect the importance of
multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial
for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in
this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM
in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2)
cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To
achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides
the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for
culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete
implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset.
Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general
performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with
models producing "thick descriptions". We verify that the performance gains are
from both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability enhancement.

Result: Arbiviewgen是首个能在多种车辆配置下生成可控任意视角相机图像的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架仅需多相机图像及其位姿，实现了无需监督的高保真视图生成。

Abstract: Arbitrary viewpoint image generation holds significant potential for
autonomous driving, yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of
ground-truth data for extrapolated views, which hampers the training of
high-fidelity generative models. In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel
diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from
arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen
views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching
(FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS
employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse
geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained
alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies
high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this,
CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs
the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a
diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision
from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and
their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional
sensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method
capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple
vehicle configurations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视觉语言推理任务中难以建模视觉状态转换，导致推理不连贯。Uni-CoT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两层次推理范式（宏观和微观CoT）和结构化训练策略，结合图像文本监督和多任务目标。

Result: 在WISE、RISE和KRIS基准测试中表现优异，计算效率高（仅需8块A100 GPU）。

Conclusion: Uni-CoT为多模态推理提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large
Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential
subtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains
challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to
support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited
capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories
caused by fragmented architectures.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought
framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a
single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image
understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving
visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is
non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To
address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A
Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask
execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.
Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines
interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task
objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to
perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our
design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs
with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation
benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT
demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT
as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning. Project Page and Code:

Conclusion: 区域感知对比预训练对医学图像理解至关重要，RegionMed-CLIP为多模态医学图像理解提供了强大基础。

Abstract: Medical image understanding plays a crucial role in enabling automated
diagnosis and data-driven clinical decision support. However, its progress is
impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality
annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which
often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address
these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal
contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized
pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of
our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively
integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by
a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal
alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we
construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that
features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions.
Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and
visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently
exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results
highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and
position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical
image understanding.

TL;DR: 提出GUI-RC和GUI-RCPO方法，通过测试时空间投票和强化学习提升GUI定位精度，无需额外训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI定位方法依赖昂贵像素级标注，限制了性能提升。

Method: 利用多预测空间重叠模式构建投票网格（GUI-RC），并转化为强化学习奖励（GUI-RCPO）。

Result: GUI-RC提升精度2-3%，GUI-RCPO进一步优化至85.14%。

Conclusion: 测试时缩放和强化学习为GUI定位提供了高效新路径。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural
language instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to
autonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance
through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled
rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level
annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the
same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence
signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we
propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs
spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus
regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC
improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot
benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy
Optimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for
test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns
with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine
their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO
further improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization. Our
approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time
reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more
robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

Conclusion: 论文为研究者提供了性别分类领域的全面分析，提出了改进建议和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Gender classification is attractive in a range of applications, including
surveillance and monitoring, corporate profiling, and human-computer
interaction. Individuals' identities may be gleaned from information about
their gender, which is a kind of soft biometric.Over the years, several methods
for determining a person's gender have been devised. Some of the most
well-known ones are based on physical characteristics like face, fingerprint,
palmprint, DNA, ears, gait, and iris. On the other hand, facial features
account for the vast majority of gender classification methods. Also, the iris
is a significant biometric trait because the iris, according to research,
remains basically constant during an individual's life. Besides that, the iris
is externally visible and is non-invasive to the user, which is important for
practical applications. Furthermore, there are already high-quality methods for
segmenting and encoding iris images, and the current methods facilitate
selecting and extracting attribute vectors from iris textures. This study
discusses several approaches to determining gender. The previous works of
literature are briefly reviewed. Additionally, there are a variety of
methodologies for different steps of gender classification. This study provides
researchers with knowledge and analysis of the existing gender classification
approaches. Also, it will assist researchers who are interested in this
specific area, as well as highlight the gaps and challenges in the field, and
finally provide suggestions and future paths for improvement.

Method: 采用多视角2D特征的快速加权融合，训练高斯级自编码器，并引入自适应稀疏化方法优化高斯属性。

Result: 仅需5%的高斯数量即可实现与Feature-3DGS竞争的结果。

Conclusion: CF3方法高效且能保留几何细节，为3D高斯特征场提供了一种更优的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has begun incorporating rich information from 2D
foundation models. However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization
process that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased
computational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact
and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast
weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This
approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted
features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the
autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we
introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian
attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant
Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric
details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little
as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.

Result: SGDFuse在主客观评估及下游任务适应性上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SGDFuse为图像融合的核心挑战提供了强大解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal
radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from
visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks.
However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of
deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can
also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image
quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes
SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core
of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as
explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a
conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a
two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal
features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the
preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's
coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only
has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of
the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as
well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution
to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at

Conclusion: B4DL基准和提出的模型为动态户外环境中的时空推理提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding dynamic outdoor environments requires capturing complex object
interactions and their evolution over time. LiDAR-based 4D point clouds provide
precise spatial geometry and rich temporal cues, making them ideal for
representing real-world scenes. However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR
remains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and
the lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional
composition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark
specifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR
understanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and
an MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by
bridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and
benchmark, our model offers a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in
dynamic outdoor environments. We provide rendered 4D LiDAR videos, generated

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于小波变换的双频编码方法（WGDF），用于遥感图像中的变化检测，通过频域特征建模提升边缘变化的感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖空间域建模，特征表示多样性有限，难以检测细微变化区域。频域特征建模（尤其是小波域）可以放大频率分量的细粒度差异，增强边缘变化的感知。

Method: 使用离散小波变换（DWT）分解图像为高频和低频成分，分别建模局部细节和全局结构。高频分支设计了双频特征增强模块（DFFE）和频域交互差异模块（FDID）；低频分支利用Transformer捕获全局语义关系，并采用渐进上下文差异模块（PCDM）细化变化区域。最终融合高低频特征。

Result: 在多个遥感数据集上的实验表明，WGDF显著减轻了边缘模糊，检测精度和鲁棒性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: WGDF通过频域特征建模有效提升了变化检测的精度，尤其是在边缘区域的感知能力。

Abstract: Change detection in remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in various
engineering applications, such as natural disaster monitoring, urban expansion
tracking, and infrastructure management. Despite the remarkable progress of
deep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on
spatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations
hinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that
frequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify
fine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of
edge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we
propose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).
Specifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the
input images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used
to model local details and global structures, respectively. In the
high-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)
module to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a
Frequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling
of fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers
to capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual
Difference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling
precise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and
low-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity
with global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing
datasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and
achieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available at
https://github.com/boshizhang123/WGDF.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于视觉语义的抑郁评估方法（VS-LLM），用于自动分析PPAT素描，以支持心理学家进行大规模心理状态评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的PPAT素描分析依赖心理学家经验且耗时，因此需要一种自动化方法来提高效率和准确性。

Method: 提出VS-LLM方法，结合视觉和语义特征，自动化分析PPAT素描，包括颜色使用和空间布局等整体评估。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比心理学家评估方法提升了17.6%的准确性。

Conclusion: 该工作为基于PPAT素描的心理状态评估提供了有效的自动化工具，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: The Drawing Projection Test (DPT) is an essential tool in art therapy,
allowing psychologists to assess participants' mental states through their
sketches. Specifically, through sketches with the theme of "a person picking an
apple from a tree (PPAT)", it can be revealed whether the participants are in
mental states such as depression. Compared with scales, the DPT can enrich
psychologists' understanding of an individual's mental state. However, the
interpretation of the PPAT is laborious and depends on the experience of the
psychologists. To address this issue, we propose an effective identification
method to support psychologists in conducting a large-scale automatic DPT.
Unlike traditional sketch recognition, DPT more focus on the overall evaluation
of the sketches, such as color usage and space utilization. Moreover, PPAT
imposes a time limit and prohibits verbal reminders, resulting in low drawing
accuracy and a lack of detailed depiction. To address these challenges, we
propose the following efforts: (1) Providing an experimental environment for
automated analysis of PPAT sketches for depression assessment; (2) Offering a
Visual-Semantic depression assessment based on LLM (VS-LLM) method; (3)
Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves by 17.6% compared to
the psychologist assessment method. We anticipate that this work will
contribute to the research in mental state assessment based on PPAT sketches'
elements recognition. Our datasets and codes are available at

Conclusion: CoCAViT通过动态全局令牌和高效设计，显著提升小模型的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale visual backbones have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in learning general-purpose features from images via extensive
pre-training. Concurrently, many efficient architectures have emerged that have
performance comparable to that of larger models on in-domain benchmarks.
However, we observe that for smaller models, the performance drop on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data is disproportionately larger, indicating a
deficiency in the generalization performance of existing efficient models. To
address this, we identify key architectural bottlenecks and inappropriate
design choices that contribute to this issue, retaining robustness for smaller
models. To restore the global field of pure window attention, we further
introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, featuring
dynamic, domain-aware global tokens that enhance local-global feature modeling
and adaptively capture robust patterns across domains with minimal
computational overhead. Integrating these advancements, we present CoCAViT, a
novel visual backbone designed for robust real-time visual representation.
Extensive experiments empirically validate our design. At a resolution of
224*224, CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with
significant gains on multiple OOD benchmarks, compared to competing models. It
also attains 52.2 mAP on COCO object detection and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K semantic

Conclusion: mKG-RAG框架通过结构化多模态知识提升了生成质量，为知识密集型VQA任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to expand
internal knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge databases into the generation process, which is widely used
for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. Despite impressive
advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents
and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently
introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and
reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate
multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the
generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework
(mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks.
Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and
vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned
entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality
multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a
dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal
retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining
precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for
knowledge-based VQA.

Motivation: 尽管大型预训练视觉语言模型在目标检测任务中表现优异，但在特定目标上仍需微调，且会丧失原始的自然语言查询和零样本能力。

Method: 采用文本反转（TI）方法，通过学习新的或改进现有词嵌入，仅需少量样本即可扩展VLM词汇表，同时保持原始模型权重不变。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种定量和定性实验中优于基线方法，且计算资源需求显著低于全模型微调。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了VLM在微调时丧失零样本能力的问题，同时提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Recent progress in large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) has
reached state-of-the-art performance on several object detection benchmarks and
boasts strong zero-shot capabilities, but for optimal performance on specific
targets some form of finetuning is still necessary. While the initial VLM
weights allow for great few-shot transfer learning, this usually involves the
loss of the original natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Textual Inversion (TI) in personalizing
text-to-image diffusion models, we propose a similar formulation for
open-vocabulary object detection. TI allows extending the VLM vocabulary by
learning new or improving existing tokens to accurately detect novel or
fine-grained objects from as little as three examples. The learned tokens are
completely compatible with the original VLM weights while keeping them frozen,
retaining the original model's benchmark performance, and leveraging its
existing capabilities such as zero-shot domain transfer (e.g., detecting a
sketch of an object after training only on real photos). The storage and
gradient calculations are limited to the token embedding dimension, requiring
significantly less compute than full-model fine-tuning. We evaluated whether
the method matches or outperforms the baseline methods that suffer from
forgetting in a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) 使用高斯函数，其低通特性限制了高频细节表示，且导致冗余基元和内存开销。

Conclusion: 3DGabSplat可作为即插即用模块，提升现有3DGS框架的新视角合成质量和效率。

Abstract: Recent prominence in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled real-time
rendering while maintaining high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, 3DGS
resorts to the Gaussian function that is low-pass by nature and is restricted
in representing high-frequency details in 3D scenes. Moreover, it causes
redundant primitives with degraded training and rendering efficiency and
excessive memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Gabor
Splatting (3DGabSplat) that leverages a novel 3D Gabor-based primitive with
multiple directional 3D frequency responses for radiance field representation
supervised by multi-view images. The proposed 3D Gabor-based primitive forms a
filter bank incorporating multiple 3D Gabor kernels at different frequencies to
enhance flexibility and efficiency in capturing fine 3D details. Furthermore,
to achieve novel view rendering, an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer is
developed to project the multiple directional 3D frequency components
characterized by 3D Gabor-based primitives onto the 2D image plane, and a
frequency-adaptive mechanism is presented for adaptive joint optimization of
primitives. 3DGabSplat is scalable to be a plug-and-play kernel for seamless
integration into existing 3DGS paradigms to enhance both efficiency and quality
of novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3DGabSplat
outperforms 3DGS and its variants using alternative primitives, and achieves
state-of-the-art rendering quality across both real-world and synthetic scenes.
Remarkably, we achieve up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS with simultaneously
reduced number of primitives and memory consumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常忽略患者的临床背景和先验图像信息，导致报告无法准确反映诊断意图或疾病进展。

Method: PriorRG采用两阶段训练：1）先验引导的对比预训练，利用临床背景指导特征提取；2）先验感知的粗到细解码，逐步整合先验知识与视觉编码器状态。

Conclusion: PriorRG通过模拟临床工作流程，显著提升了报告生成的临床准确性和流畅性。

Abstract: Chest X-ray report generation aims to reduce radiologists' workload by
automatically producing high-quality preliminary reports. A critical yet
underexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific
prior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)
and the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for
diagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single
images, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture
diagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose
PriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates
real-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we
introduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages
clinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model
to align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology
reports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for
report generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior
knowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the
model to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby
enhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports. Extensive
experiments on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets demonstrate that PriorRG
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score
improvement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN. Code and

### [71] [Cross-View Localization via Redundant Sliced Observations and A-Contrario Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05369)
*Yongjun Zhang,Mingtao Xiong,Yi Wan,Gui-Song Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Slice-Loc是一种两阶段方法，通过分割地面图像为子图像并验证冗余观测，提升跨视图定位的可靠性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨视图定位方法缺乏冗余观测，难以验证定位可靠性。

Method: Slice-Loc将查询图像分割为子图像，生成冗余3-DoF姿态，并通过几何刚性公式过滤错误姿态，最终合并有效姿态。

Result: Slice-Loc显著降低定位误差，在DReSS数据集上平均定位误差从4.47米降至1.86米，方向误差从3.42°降至1.24°。

Conclusion: Slice-Loc通过冗余观测和错误过滤，显著提升了跨视图定位的可靠性和精度。

Abstract: Cross-view localization (CVL) matches ground-level images with aerial
references to determine the geo-position of a camera, enabling smart vehicles
to self-localize offline in GNSS-denied environments. However, most CVL methods
output only a single observation, the camera pose, and lack the redundant
observations required by surveying principles, making it challenging to assess
localization reliability through the mutual validation of observational data.
To tackle this, we introduce Slice-Loc, a two-stage method featuring an
a-contrario reliability validation for CVL. Instead of using the query image as
a single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF
pose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a
geometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,
and the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we
propose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by
estimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of
the locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc
boosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures. After filtering
out mislocalizations, Slice-Loc reduces the proportion of errors exceeding 10 m
to under 3\%. In cross-city tests on the DReSS dataset, Slice-Loc cuts the mean
localization error from 4.47 m to 1.86 m and the mean orientation error from
$\mathbf{3.42^{\circ}}$ to $\mathbf{1.24^{\circ}}$, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset will be available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CT-GRAPH是一种分层图注意力网络，通过将解剖区域建模为图结构，结合全局和器官级特征，显著提升了放射报告生成的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法主要依赖全局图像特征，忽略了细粒度器官关系，影响了报告的准确性。CT-GRAPH旨在通过建模解剖知识解决这一问题。

Method: 使用预训练的3D医学特征编码器提取全局和器官级特征，并通过图注意力网络细化特征，最后结合大型语言模型生成报告。

Result: 在CT-RATE数据集上，CT-GRAPH的F1分数比现有最佳方法提高了7.9%。

Conclusion: CT-GRAPH通过建模解剖关系显著提升了放射报告生成的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: As medical imaging is central to diagnostic processes, automating the
generation of radiology reports has become increasingly relevant to assist
radiologists with their heavy workloads. Most current methods rely solely on
global image features, failing to capture fine-grained organ relationships
crucial for accurate reporting. To this end, we propose CT-GRAPH, a
hierarchical graph attention network that explicitly models radiological
knowledge by structuring anatomical regions into a graph, linking fine-grained
organ features to coarser anatomical systems and a global patient context. Our
method leverages pretrained 3D medical feature encoders to obtain global and
organ-level features by utilizing anatomical masks. These features are further
refined within the graph and then integrated into a large language model to
generate detailed medical reports. We evaluate our approach for the task of
report generation on the large-scale chest CT dataset CT-RATE. We provide an
in-depth analysis of pretrained feature encoders for CT report generation and
show that our method achieves a substantial improvement of absolute 7.9\% in F1
score over current state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如MIL和静态GNN）难以捕捉组织结构的空间依赖性和物理位置信息，且注意力机制缺乏特异性。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上达到SOTA性能，验证了可变形注意力在复杂空间结构建模中的有效性。

Conclusion: 可变形注意力GNN框架显著提升了病理图像分类的准确性和空间特异性。

Abstract: Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest
(ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream
approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to
capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet
most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial
positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack
specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions.
In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for
pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based
on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its
neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable
spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the
model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the
slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving
spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on
four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia
grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of
deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UNCAGE的无训练方法，通过利用注意力图优先解掩码明确表示单个对象的标记，提升了文本到图像生成中的组合保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型（如扩散模型和掩码生成变换器）在组合生成时难以准确绑定属性和实现文本-图像对齐，UNCAGE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出UNCAGE方法，通过对比注意力引导优先解掩码明确表示单个对象的标记，无需额外训练。

Result: UNCAGE在多个基准测试和指标上均显著提升了性能，且推理开销极小。

Conclusion: UNCAGE是一种高效且无需训练的方法，显著提升了组合文本到图像生成的质量和保真度。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has been actively studied using Diffusion
Models and Autoregressive Models. Recently, Masked Generative Transformers have
gained attention as an alternative to Autoregressive Models to overcome the
inherent limitations of causal attention and autoregressive decoding through
bidirectional attention and parallel decoding, enabling efficient and
high-quality image generation. However, compositional T2I generation remains
challenging, as even state-of-the-art Diffusion Models often fail to accurately
bind attributes and achieve proper text-image alignment. While Diffusion Models
have been extensively studied for this issue, Masked Generative Transformers
exhibit similar limitations but have not been explored in this context. To
address this, we propose Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance
(UNCAGE), a novel training-free method that improves compositional fidelity by
leveraging attention maps to prioritize the unmasking of tokens that clearly
represent individual objects. UNCAGE consistently improves performance in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
metrics, with negligible inference overhead. Our code is available at

TL;DR: TrueBiometric提出了一种新方法，通过多数投票机制和视觉语言模型检测并修正被投毒的人脸识别训练图像，有效防御后门攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御机制在检测和修正投毒图像时存在挑战，可能影响数据效用，降低了系统的可靠性。

Method: 利用多个先进视觉语言模型的多数投票机制检测投毒图像，并通过校准噪声修正。

Result: 实验表明，TrueBiometric能100%准确检测并修正投毒图像，且不影响干净图像的准确性。

Conclusion: TrueBiometric提供了一种更实用、准确和有效的解决方案，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Biometric systems, such as face recognition systems powered by deep neural
networks (DNNs), rely on large and highly sensitive datasets. Backdoor attacks
can subvert these systems by manipulating the training process. By inserting a
small trigger, such as a sticker, make-up, or patterned mask, into a few
training images, an adversary can later present the same trigger during
authentication to be falsely recognized as another individual, thereby gaining
unauthorized access. Existing defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks still
face challenges in precisely identifying and mitigating poisoned images without
compromising data utility, which undermines the overall reliability of the
system. We propose a novel and generalizable approach, TrueBiometric:
Trustworthy Biometrics, which accurately detects poisoned images using a
majority voting mechanism leveraging multiple state-of-the-art large vision
language models. Once identified, poisoned samples are corrected using targeted
and calibrated corrective noise. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate
that TrueBiometric detects and corrects poisoned images with 100\% accuracy
without compromising accuracy on clean images. Compared to existing
state-of-the-art approaches, TrueBiometric offers a more practical, accurate,
and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in face recognition
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理对抗伪装在安全关键领域（如自动驾驶）中构成重大安全风险，现有技术因环境变化导致梯度优化不稳定和攻击效果下降。

Method: 引入梯度校准策略确保梯度一致性，开发梯度去相关方法优化多角度梯度更新，提升稳定性和攻击效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在攻击成功率上平均提升13.46%（距离）和11.03%（角度），显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了物理对抗伪装中的优化问题，同时强调了现实场景中系统设计的鲁棒性需求。

Abstract: The advancement of deep object detectors has greatly affected safety-critical
fields like autonomous driving. However, physical adversarial camouflage poses
a significant security risk by altering object textures to deceive detectors.
Existing techniques struggle with variable physical environments, facing two
main challenges: 1) inconsistent sampling point densities across distances
hinder the gradient optimization from ensuring local continuity, and 2)
updating texture gradients from multiple angles causes conflicts, reducing
optimization stability and attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose a novel adversarial camouflage framework based on gradient
optimization. First, we introduce a gradient calibration strategy, which
ensures consistent gradient updates across distances by propagating gradients
from sparsely to unsampled texture points. Additionally, we develop a gradient
decorrelation method, which prioritizes and orthogonalizes gradients based on
loss values, enhancing stability and effectiveness in multi-angle optimization
by eliminating redundant or conflicting updates. Extensive experimental results
on various detection models, angles and distances show that our method
significantly exceeds the state of the art, with an average increase in attack
success rate (ASR) of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles.
Furthermore, empirical evaluation in real-world scenarios highlights the need
for more robust system design.

TL;DR: SmoothSA改进Slot Attention（SA）及其变体，通过预热冷启动查询和区分帧间变换，提升对象中心学习（OCL）在图像和视频中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷启动查询缺乏样本特定信息，影响图像或视频首帧的精确聚合；非首帧查询已具备样本信息，需不同变换。

Method: （1）预热冷启动查询，通过自蒸馏模块丰富输入信息；（2）区分首帧和非首帧的变换，分别使用完整和单次迭代。

Result: 在对象发现、识别及下游任务中验证了方法的有效性，直观展示了如何平滑SA迭代和递归。

Conclusion: SmoothSA通过预热和区分变换，显著提升了SA在OCL中的性能。

Abstract: Slot Attention (SA) and its variants lie at the heart of mainstream
Object-Centric Learning (OCL). Objects in an image can be aggregated into
respective slot vectors, by \textit{iteratively} refining cold-start query
vectors, typically three times, via SA on image features. For video, such
aggregation is \textit{recurrently} shared across frames, with queries
cold-started on the first frame while transitioned from the previous frame's
slots on non-first frames. However, the cold-start queries lack sample-specific
cues thus hinder precise aggregation on the image or video's first frame; Also,
non-first frames' queries are already sample-specific thus require transforms
different from the first frame's aggregation. We address these issues for the
first time with our \textit{SmoothSA}: (1) To smooth SA iterations on the image
or video's first frame, we \textit{preheat} the cold-start queries with rich
information of input features, via a tiny module self-distilled inside OCL; (2)
To smooth SA recurrences across all video frames, we \textit{differentiate} the
homogeneous transforms on the first and non-first frames, by using full and
single iterations respectively. Comprehensive experiments on object discovery,
recognition and downstream benchmarks validate our method's effectiveness.
Further analyses intuitively illuminate how our method smooths SA iterations
and recurrences. Our code is available in the supplement.

Method: 基于博弈论的加权Banzhaf交互指数，提出FIxLIP方法，扩展了二阶交互解释的评估指标。

Result: 在MS COCO和ImageNet-1k基准测试中，FIxLIP优于一阶方法，并成功用于模型比较。

Conclusion: FIxLIP提供高质量的二阶交互解释，为视觉语言模型的解释和比较提供了新工具。

Abstract: Language-image pre-training (LIP) enables the development of vision-language
models capable of zero-shot classification, localization, multimodal retrieval,
and semantic understanding. Various explanation methods have been proposed to
visualize the importance of input image-text pairs on the model's similarity
outputs. However, popular saliency maps are limited by capturing only
first-order attributions, overlooking the complex cross-modal interactions
intrinsic to such encoders. We introduce faithful interaction explanations of
LIP models (FIxLIP) as a unified approach to decomposing the similarity in
vision-language encoders. FIxLIP is rooted in game theory, where we analyze how
using the weighted Banzhaf interaction index offers greater flexibility and
improves computational efficiency over the Shapley interaction quantification
framework. From a practical perspective, we propose how to naturally extend
explanation evaluation metrics, like the pointing game and area between the
insertion/deletion curves, to second-order interaction explanations.
Experiments on MS COCO and ImageNet-1k benchmarks validate that second-order
methods like FIxLIP outperform first-order attribution methods. Beyond
delivering high-quality explanations, we demonstrate the utility of FIxLIP in
comparing different models like CLIP vs. SigLIP-2 and ViT-B/32 vs. ViT-L/16.

Method: 提出时间反向FM（rFM）和WT插值，构建非概率演化路径，增强对样本轨迹的动态控制。

Result: 在MVTec数据集上实现单尺度下的最优性能。

Conclusion: FM为无监督异常检测提供了理论支持的计算框架，具有可扩展性。

Abstract: We propose a new paradigm for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization
using Flow Matching (FM), which fundamentally addresses the model expressivity
limitations of conventional flow-based methods. To this end, we formalize the
concept of time-reversed Flow Matching (rFM) as a vector field regression along
a predefined probability path to transform unknown data distributions into
standard Gaussian. We bring two core observations that reshape our
understanding of FM. First, we rigorously prove that FM with linear
interpolation probability paths is inherently non-invertible. Second, our
analysis reveals that employing reversed Gaussian probability paths in
high-dimensional spaces can lead to trivial vector fields. This issue arises
due to the manifold-related constraints. Building on the second observation, we
propose Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation to reconstruct a
non-probabilistic evolution path. The proposed WT-Flow enhances dynamical
control over sample trajectories, constructing ''degenerate potential wells''
for anomaly-free samples while allowing anomalous samples to escape. This novel
unsupervised paradigm offers a theoretically grounded separation mechanism for
anomalous samples. Notably, FM provides a computationally tractable framework
that scales to complex data. We present the first successful application of FM
for the unsupervised anomaly detection task, achieving state-of-the-art
performance at a single scale on the MVTec dataset. The reproducible code for
training will be released upon camera-ready submission.

Result: F2PASeg能实时分割关键解剖结构，适应术中变化。

Conclusion: F2PASeg为垂体手术规划提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Pituitary tumors often cause deformation or encapsulation of adjacent vital
structures. Anatomical structure segmentation can provide surgeons with early
warnings of regions that pose surgical risks, thereby enhancing the safety of
pituitary surgery. However, pixel-level annotated video stream datasets for
pituitary surgeries are extremely rare. To address this challenge, we introduce
a new dataset for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation (PAS). PAS comprises 7,845
time-coherent images extracted from 120 videos. To mitigate class imbalance, we
apply data augmentation techniques that simulate the presence of surgical
instruments in the training data. One major challenge in pituitary anatomy
segmentation is the inconsistency in feature representation due to occlusions,
camera motion, and surgical bleeding. By incorporating a Feature Fusion module,
F2PASeg is proposed to refine anatomical structure segmentation by leveraging
both high-resolution image features and deep semantic embeddings, enhancing
robustness against intraoperative variations. Experimental results demonstrate
that F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time,
providing a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.

Motivation: 研究压缩模型在对抗性攻击中的防御能力，尤其是高真实感重建图像对攻击难度的影响。

Method: 构建强白盒和自适应攻击，评估多种压缩模型在不同攻击场景下的表现。

Result: 高真实感重建图像的压缩模型对攻击更具抵抗力，而低真实感模型易被攻破。真实感重建通过保持与自然图像的分布对齐提供固有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 高真实感重建图像是未来对抗性攻击的重要障碍，开发克服真实感的技术对全面安全评估至关重要。

Abstract: Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy
compression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive
attack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong
white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify
a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images
significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across
multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of
producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more
resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be
broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather,
realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural
images seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant
obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more
effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for
comprehensive security evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练基础模型在现代图像领域表现优异，但在历史地图上表现不佳，因其缺乏一致的视觉模式与概念关联。

Method: 通过替换SAM模型的提示编码器为OND机制，并针对历史地图进行微调，实现用户自定义概念与模式的关联。

Result: SMOL-MapSeg能准确分割OND定义类别，并通过少量样本适应新类别，平均分割性能优于UNet基线。

Conclusion: OND知识提示机制有效提升了基础模型在历史地图分割中的性能，展示了其灵活性和适应性。

Abstract: Historical maps are valuable for studying changes to the Earth's surface.
With the rise of deep learning, models like UNet have been used to extract
information from these maps through semantic segmentation. Recently,
pre-trained foundation models have shown strong performance across domains such
as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and industrial inspection. However,
they struggle with historical maps. These models are trained on modern or
domain-specific images, where patterns can be tied to predefined concepts
through common sense or expert knowledge. Historical maps lack such consistency
-- similar concepts can appear in vastly different shapes and styles. To
address this, we propose On-Need Declarative (OND) knowledge-based prompting,
which introduces explicit prompts to guide the model on what patterns
correspond to which concepts. This allows users to specify the target concept
and pattern during inference (on-need inference). We implement this by
replacing the prompt encoder of the foundation model SAM with our OND prompting
mechanism and fine-tune it on historical maps. The resulting model is called
SMOL-MapSeg (Show Me One Label). Experiments show that SMOL-MapSeg can
accurately segment classes defined by OND knowledge. It can also adapt to
unseen classes through few-shot fine-tuning. Additionally, it outperforms a
UNet-based baseline in average segmentation performance.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is critical for manufacturing quality
control, but conventionally requires significant manual effort for various
application scenarios. This paper introduces AutoIAD, a multi-agent
collaboration framework, specifically designed for end-to-end automated
development of industrial visual anomaly detection. AutoIAD leverages a
Manager-Driven central agent to orchestrate specialized sub-agents (including
Data Preparation, Data Loader, Model Designer, Trainer) and integrates a
domain-specific knowledge base, which intelligently handles the entire pipeline
using raw industrial image data to develop a trained anomaly detection model.
We construct a comprehensive benchmark using MVTec AD datasets to evaluate
AutoIAD across various LLM backends. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AutoIAD significantly outperforms existing general-purpose agentic
collaboration frameworks and traditional AutoML frameworks in task completion
rate and model performance (AUROC), while effectively mitigating issues like
hallucination through iterative refinement. Ablation studies further confirm
the crucial roles of the Manager central agent and the domain knowledge base
module in producing robust and high-quality IAD solutions.

Conclusion: 手性特征提取器在形状分析中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Chirality information (i.e. information that allows distinguishing left from
right) is ubiquitous for various data modes in computer vision, including
images, videos, point clouds, and meshes. While chirality has been extensively
studied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point
clouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex
descriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body
transformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and
right symmetric parts. Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in
different shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features
within current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor
becomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose
an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape
vertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models.
We evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and
qualitative experiments across diverse datasets. Results from downstream tasks
including left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation
demonstrate their effectiveness and practical utility. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖物体模板或假设物体完全可见，但在实际场景中固定视角和静态抓握会导致部分物体不可见，重建结果不真实。

Method: MagicHOI结合新视角合成扩散模型作为先验，并引入可见接触约束对齐手和物体。

Result: 实验表明，MagicHOI显著优于现有方法，新视角合成扩散先验有效规范了不可见区域。

Conclusion: MagicHOI通过新视角合成扩散先验和接触约束，提升了手-物体重建的准确性。

Abstract: Most RGB-based hand-object reconstruction methods rely on object templates,
while template-free methods typically assume full object visibility. This
assumption often breaks in real-world settings, where fixed camera viewpoints
and static grips leave parts of the object unobserved, resulting in implausible
reconstructions. To overcome this, we present MagicHOI, a method for
reconstructing hands and objects from short monocular interaction videos, even
under limited viewpoint variation. Our key insight is that, despite the
scarcity of paired 3D hand-object data, large-scale novel view synthesis
diffusion models offer rich object supervision. This supervision serves as a
prior to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions. Leveraging
this insight, we integrate a novel view synthesis model into our hand-object
reconstruction framework. We further align hand to object by incorporating
visible contact constraints. Our results demonstrate that MagicHOI
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art hand-object reconstruction
methods. We also show that novel view synthesis diffusion priors effectively
regularize unseen object regions, enhancing 3D hand-object reconstruction.

*Lin Zhu,Ruonan Liu,Xiao Wang,Lizhi Wang,Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督预训练框架，用于从事件相机数据中提取潜在信息，包括边缘和纹理线索，并在多个下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件数据稀疏且噪声多，主要反映亮度变化，难以有效提取特征。

Method: 框架包含三个阶段：差异引导的掩码建模、主干固定的特征转换和聚焦对比学习。

Result: 在目标识别、语义分割和光流估计等任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效提取事件数据中的潜在信息，并在多种任务中表现稳健。

Abstract: Event camera, a novel neuromorphic vision sensor, records data with high
temporal resolution and wide dynamic range, offering new possibilities for
accurate visual representation in challenging scenarios. However, event data is
inherently sparse and noisy, mainly reflecting brightness changes, which
complicates effective feature extraction. To address this, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training framework to fully reveal latent information in
event data, including edge information and texture cues. Our framework consists
of three stages: Difference-guided Masked Modeling, inspired by the event
physical sampling process, reconstructs temporal intensity difference maps to
extract enhanced information from raw event data. Backbone-fixed Feature
Transition contrasts event and image features without updating the backbone to
preserve representations learned from masked modeling and stabilizing their
effect on contrastive learning. Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning updates the
entire model to improve semantic discrimination by focusing on high-value
regions. Extensive experiments show our framework is robust and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various downstream tasks, including
object recognition, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation. The
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/BIT-Vision/EventPretrain.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种增强的行人跟踪框架，通过结合更丰富的特征表示和鲁棒的运动模型，解决严重遮挡场景下的跟踪问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，行人跟踪因遮挡问题导致特征丢失，传统方法在严重遮挡场景下表现不佳。

Method: 结合目标检测器的回归和分类分支特征，引入头部关键点检测模型，并提出迭代卡尔曼滤波方法。

Result: 提出的方法在遮挡严重的拥挤环境中提供了更鲁棒的多目标跟踪解决方案。

Conclusion: 通过改进外观和运动建模，该方法在复杂场景中显著提升了跟踪性能。

Abstract: Visual pedestrian tracking represents a promising research field, with
extensive applications in intelligent surveillance, behavior analysis, and
human-computer interaction. However, real-world applications face significant
occlusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss
of target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain
stable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on
full-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear
constant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion
scenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced
tracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more
robust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection
features from both the regression and classification branches of an object
detector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the
feature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head
keypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion
compared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative
Kalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions,
integrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes.
By combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed
method offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded
environments where occlusions are prevalent.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于特征空间随机平滑的新型IQA模型认证防御方法，保留图像质量同时提供鲁棒性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在输入空间注入高斯噪声会降低图像质量，需改进以保持视觉保真度。

Method: 在特征空间而非输入空间应用噪声，通过分析主干网络Jacobian的最大奇异值连接噪声水平与输入空间扰动。

Result: 减少推理时间99.5%（无认证）和20.6%（有认证），在主观质量评分相关性上提升高达30.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且通用，适用于多种IQA模型，显著提升性能与效率。

Abstract: We propose a novel certified defense method for Image Quality Assessment
(IQA) models based on randomized smoothing with noise applied in the feature
space rather than the input space. Unlike prior approaches that inject Gaussian
noise directly into input images, often degrading visual quality, our method
preserves image fidelity while providing robustness guarantees. To formally
connect noise levels in the feature space with corresponding input-space
perturbations, we analyze the maximum singular value of the backbone network's
Jacobian. Our approach supports both full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
IQA models without requiring any architectural modifications, suitable for
various scenarios. It is also computationally efficient, requiring a single
backbone forward pass per image. Compared to previous methods, it reduces
inference time by 99.5% without certification and by 20.6% when certification
is applied. We validate our method with extensive experiments on two benchmark
datasets, involving six widely-used FR and NR IQA models and comparisons
against five state-of-the-art certified defenses. Our results demonstrate
consistent improvements in correlation with subjective quality scores by up to
30.9%.

Conclusion: AI辅助方法可解决临床试验操作中的低效问题，加速药物开发并降低成本，同时保持合规性。

Abstract: Clinical trial data cleaning represents a critical bottleneck in drug
development, with manual review processes struggling to manage exponentially
increasing data volumes and complexity. This paper presents Octozi, an
artificial intelligence-assisted platform that combines large language models
with domain-specific heuristics to transform clinical data review. In a
controlled experimental study with experienced clinical reviewers (n=10), we
demonstrate that AI assistance increased data cleaning throughput by 6.03-fold
while simultaneously decreasing cleaning errors from 54.67% to 8.48% (a
6.44-fold improvement). Crucially, the system reduced false positive queries by
15.48-fold, minimizing unnecessary site burden. These improvements were
consistent across reviewers regardless of experience level, suggesting broad
applicability. Our findings indicate that AI-assisted approaches can address
fundamental inefficiencies in clinical trial operations, potentially
accelerating drug development timelines and reducing costs while maintaining
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for integrating AI
into safety-critical clinical workflows and demonstrates the transformative
potential of human-AI collaboration in pharmaceutical clinical trials.

Method: 1. 提出Jacobian Criterion，评估参数重要性；2. 设计Equivalent Pruning机制，通过自编码器保留原始连接的贡献。

Result: Jacobian Criterion在保持模型性能上优于其他指标，Equivalent Pruning有效减少微调后的性能下降。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在结构剪枝中表现优异，解决了参数互联问题。

Abstract: Structural pruning has been widely studied for its effectiveness in
compressing neural networks. However, existing methods often neglect the
interconnections among parameters. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes a structural pruning framework termed Optimal Brain Connection. First,
we introduce the Jacobian Criterion, a first-order metric for evaluating the
saliency of structural parameters. Unlike existing first-order methods that
assess parameters in isolation, our criterion explicitly captures both
intra-component interactions and inter-layer dependencies. Second, we propose
the Equivalent Pruning mechanism, which utilizes autoencoders to retain the
contributions of all original connection--including pruned ones--during
fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the Jacobian Criterion
outperforms several popular metrics in preserving model performance, while the
Equivalent Pruning mechanism effectively mitigates performance degradation
after fine-tuning. Code: https://github.com/ShaowuChen/Optimal_Brain_Connection

Conclusion: SSTGNN是一种高效、轻量且可扩展的解决方案，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: The proliferation of generative video models has made detecting AI-generated
and manipulated videos an urgent challenge. Existing detection approaches often
fail to generalize across diverse manipulation types due to their reliance on
isolated spatial, temporal, or spectral information, and typically require
large models to perform well. This paper introduces SSTGNN, a lightweight
Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network framework that represents videos
as structured graphs, enabling joint reasoning over spatial inconsistencies,
temporal artifacts, and spectral distortions. SSTGNN incorporates learnable
spectral filters and temporal differential modeling into a graph-based
architecture, capturing subtle manipulation traces more effectively. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSTGNN not only
achieves superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, but
also offers strong robustness against unseen manipulations. Remarkably, SSTGNN
accomplishes these results with up to 42.4$\times$ fewer parameters than
state-of-the-art models, making it highly lightweight and scalable for
real-world deployment.

Result: MLLMs在多模态品牌安全分类中表现有效，但仍存在局限性。

Conclusion: 研究支持MLLMs在内容审核中的潜力，同时强调需进一步改进，并公开数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: As the volume of video content online grows exponentially, the demand for
moderation of unsafe videos has surpassed human capabilities, posing both
operational and mental health challenges. While recent studies demonstrated the
merits of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in various video
understanding tasks, their application to multimodal content moderation, a
domain that requires nuanced understanding of both visual and textual cues,
remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we benchmark the capabilities
of MLLMs in brand safety classification, a critical subset of content
moderation for safe-guarding advertising integrity. To this end, we introduce a
novel, multimodal and multilingual dataset, meticulously labeled by
professional reviewers in a multitude of risk categories. Through a detailed
comparative analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLMs such as Gemini,
GPT, and Llama in multimodal brand safety, and evaluate their accuracy and cost
efficiency compared to professional human reviewers. Furthermore, we present an
in-depth discussion shedding light on limitations of MLLMs and failure cases.
We are releasing our dataset alongside this paper to facilitate future research
on effective and responsible brand safety and content moderation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“Action Discovery”的新方法，用于解决部分标注数据集中模糊动作和不完整标注的问题。通过两步法（GGSM和UASA）识别未知动作的时间和语义信息，并在三个数据集上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在神经科学等领域，部分动作因模糊或缺失标签而未被标注，导致数据集不完整。现有方法难以处理此类问题，因此需要一种新方法。

Method: 采用两步法：1) GGSM模块通过模仿已知动作的粒度识别时间区间；2) UASA模块基于嵌入相似性为未知动作分配语义类别。

Result: 在Breakfast、50Salads和Desktop Assembly数据集上，该方法显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Action Discovery为部分标注数据集中的动作识别提供了有效解决方案，尤其在处理模糊和未知动作时表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce Action Discovery, a novel setup within Temporal Action
Segmentation that addresses the challenge of defining and annotating ambiguous
actions and incomplete annotations in partially labeled datasets. In this
setup, only a subset of actions - referred to as known actions - is annotated
in the training data, while other unknown actions remain unlabeled. This
scenario is particularly relevant in domains like neuroscience, where
well-defined behaviors (e.g., walking, eating) coexist with subtle or
infrequent actions that are often overlooked, as well as in applications where
datasets are inherently partially annotated due to ambiguous or missing labels.
To address this problem, we propose a two-step approach that leverages the
known annotations to guide both the temporal and semantic granularity of
unknown action segments. First, we introduce the Granularity-Guided
Segmentation Module (GGSM), which identifies temporal intervals for both known
and unknown actions by mimicking the granularity of annotated actions. Second,
we propose the Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA), which identifies
semantically meaningful classes within the unknown actions, based on learned
embedding similarities. We systematically explore the proposed setting of
Action Discovery on three challenging datasets - Breakfast, 50Salads, and
Desktop Assembly - demonstrating that our method considerably improves upon
existing baselines.

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Instruction是一种可扩展且高效的数据生成引擎，为生成智能提供了潜力。

Abstract: With the growing demands of AI-generated content (AIGC), the need for
high-quality, diverse, and scalable data has become increasingly crucial.
However, collecting large-scale real-world data remains costly and
time-consuming, hindering the development of downstream applications. While
some works attempt to collect task-specific data via a rendering process, most
approaches still rely on manual scene construction, limiting their scalability
and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Follow-Your-Instruction,
a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven framework for automatically
synthesizing high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data. Our
\textbf{Follow-Your-Instruction} first collects assets and their associated
descriptions through multimodal inputs using the MLLM-Collector. Then it
constructs 3D layouts, and leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for semantic
refinement through multi-view scenes with the MLLM-Generator and
MLLM-Optimizer, respectively. Finally, it uses MLLM-Planner to generate
temporally coherent future frames. We evaluate the quality of the generated
data through comprehensive experiments on the 2D, 3D, and 4D generative tasks.
The results show that our synthetic data significantly boosts the performance
of existing baseline models, demonstrating Follow-Your-Instruction's potential
as a scalable and effective data engine for generative intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLP模型在细粒度定位和类别依赖建模上的不足。

Method: 提出DART框架，包含ARM和ATM模块，分别优化定位和类别关系。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DART有效整合LLM知识，显著提升OV-MLR任务表现。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple
seen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise
intra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class
reasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language
Pre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often
struggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically
fail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic
semantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome
these limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)
framework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive
modules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM)
refines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch
Selecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only
image-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive
Transfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed
using structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs
graph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between
class representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to
explicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive
inter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class
refinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, validating its effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有视觉分词器在压缩比和重建保真度之间难以平衡，WeTok旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用分组无查找量化（GQ）和生成解码（GD）技术，优化内存和计算效率，并提升重建效果。

Result: 在ImageNet 50k验证集上，WeTok实现了最低的零样本rFID（0.12），并在高压缩比下表现优异。

Conclusion: WeTok在视觉生成任务中表现出色，为视觉分词器提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual tokenizer is a critical component for vision generation. However, the
existing tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
ratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful
and concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers
via two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We
partition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization
for each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation
limitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough
with more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from
prior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise
variable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of
visual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct
visual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on
mainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet
50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs.
FLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19). Furthermore, our highest compression
model achieves a zero-shot rFID of 3.49 with a compression ratio of 768,
outperforming Cosmos (384) 4.57 which has only 50% compression rate of ours.

Result: 实验验证了LLaVA-RE框架的有效性。

Conclusion: LLaVA-RE为二元图像-文本相关性评估提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal generative AI usually involves generating image or text responses
given inputs in another modality. The evaluation of image-text relevancy is
essential for measuring response quality or ranking candidate responses. In
particular, binary relevancy evaluation, i.e., ``Relevant'' vs. ``Not
Relevant'', is a fundamental problem. However, this is a challenging task
considering that texts have diverse formats and the definition of relevancy
varies in different scenarios. We find that Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) are an ideal choice to build such evaluators, as they can flexibly
handle complex text formats and take in additional task information. In this
paper, we present LLaVA-RE, a first attempt for binary image-text relevancy
evaluation with MLLM. It follows the LLaVA architecture and adopts detailed
task instructions and multimodal in-context samples. In addition, we propose a
novel binary relevancy data set that covers various tasks. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our framework.

Conclusion: Hi3DEval为3D生成内容提供了可扩展的评估方案，替代手动评估。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the
generated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on
image-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their
ability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity
local details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a
hierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It
combines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic
assessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality
analysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic
appearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes
such as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we
construct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and
high-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation
pipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on
hybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based
representations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance
modeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for
part-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and
achieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable
alternative to manual evaluations. The project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频对象分割（VOS）方法在简单数据集上表现优异，但在真实复杂场景中泛化能力不足，MOSEv2旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 通过构建包含5,024个视频和701,976个高质量掩码的数据集MOSEv2，引入更复杂的场景（如遮挡、恶劣天气、低光照等），并评估20种VOS方法和9种跟踪方法。

Result: 现有方法在MOSEv2上性能显著下降（如SAM2从76.4%降至50.9%），表明其在真实场景中仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: MOSEv2为VOS研究提供了更真实的测试平台，揭示了当前方法的局限性，并推动未来技术进步。

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects
throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive
performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and
YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated
objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS
toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)
was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the
strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more
challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world
conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks
for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2
introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent
object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller
objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g.,
rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot
sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows,
reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20
representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent
performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9%
on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar
declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These
results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS
methods still struggle under real-world complexities. MOSEv2 is publicly
available at https://MOSE.video.

Conclusion: GAP成功解决了无色彩点云生成高斯的挑战，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its advantages in achieving
fast and high-quality rendering. As point clouds serve as a widely-used and
easily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point
clouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have
explored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly
generating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved
challenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes
raw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key
idea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a
depth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across
different viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a
surface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the
surfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a
diffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing
hard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation
task across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to
challenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes. Project Page:

### [101] [FaceAnonyMixer: Cancelable Faces via Identity Consistent Latent Space Mixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05636)
*Mohammed Talha Alam,Fahad Shamshad,Fakhri Karray,Karthik Nandakumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaceAnonyMixer提出了一种可撤销的人脸生成框架，通过混合真实人脸图像的潜在代码与可撤销密钥生成的合成代码，实现隐私保护，同时保持识别准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸识别技术的发展引发了隐私问题，现有方法无法满足生物特征模板保护的可撤销性、不可链接性和不可逆性要求。

Method: 利用预训练生成模型的潜在空间，混合真实人脸与合成代码，并通过多目标损失优化，生成高质量可撤销人脸。

Result: 实验表明，FaceAnonyMixer在商业API上比现有方法提升了11%的识别准确率，同时提供更强的隐私保护。

Conclusion: FaceAnonyMixer是一种高效的人脸匿名化方法，兼具识别准确性和隐私保护能力。

Abstract: Advancements in face recognition (FR) technologies have amplified privacy
concerns, necessitating methods that protect identity while maintaining
recognition utility. Existing face anonymization methods typically focus on
obscuring identity but fail to meet the requirements of biometric template
protection, including revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility. We
propose FaceAnonyMixer, a cancelable face generation framework that leverages
the latent space of a pre-trained generative model to synthesize
privacy-preserving face images. The core idea of FaceAnonyMixer is to
irreversibly mix the latent code of a real face image with a synthetic code
derived from a revocable key. The mixed latent code is further refined through
a carefully designed multi-objective loss to satisfy all cancelable biometric
requirements. FaceAnonyMixer is capable of generating high-quality cancelable
faces that can be directly matched using existing FR systems without requiring
any modifications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FaceAnonyMixer delivers superior recognition accuracy while providing
significantly stronger privacy protection, achieving over an 11% gain on
commercial API compared to recent cancelable biometric methods. Code is

*Thomas Thebaud,Yen-Ju Lu,Matthew Wiesner,Peter Viechnicki,Najim Dehak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在对话转录后处理中添加说话者特征元数据标签的方法，结合音频基础模型和语言模型，无需微调即可实现高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升对话转录的可读性和信息丰富性，通过添加说话者特征（如年龄、性别、情感）的元数据标签。

Method: 结合冻结的音频基础模型（如Whisper或WavLM）和冻结的LLAMA语言模型，通过轻量级连接器推断说话者属性。

Result: 在说话者分析任务中表现优异，同时保持模块化和速度；LLAMA模型在某些场景下直接比较x-向量的等错误率为8.8%。

Conclusion: 该方法为对话转录后处理提供了新的补充步骤，无需微调即可高效实现说话者特征标注。

Abstract: In dialogue transcription pipelines, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
frequently employed in post-processing to improve grammar, punctuation, and
readability. We explore a complementary post-processing step: enriching
transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such
as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire
dialogue, while some are time-variant. Our approach couples frozen audio
foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model
to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning
of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and
language representations, we achieve competitive performance on speaker
profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed. Additionally, we
demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving
an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

*Negar Foroutan,Clara Meister,Debjit Paul,Joel Niklaus,Sina Ahmadi,Antoine Bosselut,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的BPE算法（Parity-aware BPE），旨在解决传统BPE算法在低资源语言中的不公平问题，通过优化压缩增益实现跨语言公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BPE算法基于频率的目标导致低资源语言的tokenization效果较差，加剧了语言间的计算和财务不平等。

Method: 提出Parity-aware BPE算法，在每一步合并时优先优化当前压缩效果最差的语言的压缩增益。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著改善了跨语言的token数量公平性，且对全局压缩率和下游任务性能影响极小。

Conclusion: Parity-aware BPE是一种有效的解决方案，能够在不牺牲性能的前提下提升低资源语言的tokenization公平性。

Abstract: Tokenization is the first -- and often least scrutinized -- step of most NLP
pipelines. Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based
objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and
consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are
disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with
<UNK> placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and
financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To
remedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of
the widely-used BPE algorithm. At every merge step, Parity-aware BPE maximizes
the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a
small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity. We find
empirically that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across
languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial
effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.

Method: 提出联合ASR和音高重音检测的模型，利用半监督语音表示进行训练。

Result: 音高重音检测F1分数提升41%，ASR在LibriSpeech上的WER降低28.3%。

Conclusion: 扩展预训练语音模型以保留或重新学习音高重音等韵律线索的重要性。

Abstract: We show the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that

significant improvement on the state-of-the-art for the task, closing the gap
in F1-score by 41%. Additionally, the ASR performance in joint training
decreases WER by 28.3% on LibriSpeech, under limited resource fine-tuning. With
these results, we show the importance of extending pretrained speech models to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型的人格稳定性，以评估其安全部署的可行性。

Method: 使用传统和LLM适应的人格测量工具，系统测试模型在不同条件下的响应变异性。

Result: 发现模型响应变异性高，干预措施可能增加不稳定性，人格对齐策略可能不足。

Conclusion: 当前LLM缺乏行为一致性基础，人格对齐策略在安全关键应用中可能不适用。

Abstract: Large language models require consistent behavioral patterns for safe
deployment, yet their personality-like traits remain poorly understood. We
present PERSIST (PERsonality Stability in Synthetic Text), a comprehensive
evaluation framework testing 25+ open-source models (1B-671B parameters) across
500,000+ responses. Using traditional (BFI-44, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted
personality instruments, we systematically vary question order, paraphrasing,
personas, and reasoning modes. Our findings challenge fundamental deployment
assumptions: (1) Even 400B+ models exhibit substantial response variability (SD
> 0.4); (2) Minor prompt reordering alone shifts personality measurements by up
to 20%; (3) Interventions expected to stabilize behavior, such as
chain-of-thought reasoning, detailed personas instruction, inclusion of
conversation history, can paradoxically increase variability; (4) LLM-adapted
instruments show equal instability to human-centric versions, confirming
architectural rather than translational limitations. This persistent
instability across scales and mitigation strategies suggests current LLMs lack
the foundations for genuine behavioral consistency. For safety-critical
applications requiring predictable behavior, these findings indicate that
personality-based alignment strategies may be fundamentally inadequate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协调方案依赖静态或全上下文路由策略，导致令牌消耗过多、内存冗余且适应性差。

Method: 提出RCR-Router框架，通过轻量级评分策略动态选择内存子集，迭代整合代理输出到共享内存。

Result: 在HotPotQA等基准测试中，令牌使用减少30%，答案质量保持或提升。

Conclusion: 结构化内存路由和输出感知评估对可扩展多代理LLM系统至关重要。

Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in
complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most
existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing
strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory
exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce
RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to
enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge,
this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically
relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while
adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory
selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory
store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model
behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures
LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three
multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate
that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining
answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory
routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个用于评估大语言模型（LLM）对语言标记（如性别、社会阶层或地域背景）反应的基准测试，揭示了模型对某些语言模式（如模糊语言）的系统性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是检测和量化LLM在语言使用中可能存在的歧视性偏见，特别是在自动评估系统中。

Method: 通过100个经过验证的问题-回答对构建的模拟访谈，生成受控的语言变体，以隔离特定现象并保持语义等价。

Result: 结果显示，模糊语言的回答平均评分低25.6%，验证了基准测试在识别模型特定偏见方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 本研究为检测和测量AI系统中的语言歧视奠定了基础，对自动决策中的公平性具有广泛意义。

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how Large
Language Models (LLMs) respond to linguistic shibboleths: subtle linguistic
markers that can inadvertently reveal demographic attributes such as gender,
social class, or regional background. Through carefully constructed interview
simulations using 100 validated question-response pairs, we demonstrate how
LLMs systematically penalize certain linguistic patterns, particularly hedging
language, despite equivalent content quality. Our benchmark generates
controlled linguistic variations that isolate specific phenomena while
maintaining semantic equivalence, which enables the precise measurement of
demographic bias in automated evaluation systems. We validate our approach
along multiple linguistic dimensions, showing that hedged responses receive
25.6% lower ratings on average, and demonstrate the benchmark's effectiveness
in identifying model-specific biases. This work establishes a foundational
framework for detecting and measuring linguistic discrimination in AI systems,
with broad applications to fairness in automated decision-making contexts.

*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言聚类的框架，用于更全面地评估视觉活动识别系统的性能，解决了标准评估方法中因动词语义模糊性导致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准评估方法因动词语义模糊性（如同义词和不同视角）无法全面评估模型性能，需要更鲁棒的评估方法。

Method: 提出视觉语言聚类框架，构建动词意义簇，用于评估模型性能。

Result: 在imSitu数据集上，每张图像平均映射到2.8个意义簇，簇基评估与人类判断更一致。

Conclusion: 簇基评估能更全面地反映模型性能，优于标准评估方法。

Abstract: Evaluating visual activity recognition systems is challenging due to inherent
ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. When describing actions
in images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs.
grooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct
verb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation,
which relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities,
resulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we
propose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense
clusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu
dataset shows that each image maps to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, with
each cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate
multiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation
with standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis
suggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements,
offering a more nuanced assessment of model performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多阶段大语言模型框架，用于从非结构化文本中提取社会健康决定因素（SDoH），以解决数据驱动方法中的长尾分布、关键压力源分析和模型可解释性不足等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会健康决定因素（SDoH）对自杀事件的影响至关重要，但现有方法在数据分布、压力源分析和模型可解释性方面存在挑战。

Method: 采用多阶段大语言模型框架，并与BioBERT、GPT-3.5-turbo和DeepSeek-R1等模型进行比较，同时评估模型解释对标注效率的影响。

Result: 提出的框架在SDoH提取和相关上下文检索任务中表现更优，且通过微调小模型降低了推理成本。多阶段设计提高了可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了从非结构化文本中提取自杀相关SDoH的准确性和透明度，有助于早期风险识别和预防策略制定。

Abstract: Background: Understanding social determinants of health (SDoH) factors
contributing to suicide incidents is crucial for early intervention and
prevention. However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such
as long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding
suicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a
multi-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction
from unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art
language models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning
models (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help
people annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included
both automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our
proposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of
extracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant
context. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model
achieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs. The
multi-stage design not only enhances extraction but also provides intermediate
explanations, improving model explainability. Conclusions: Our approach
improves both the accuracy and transparency of extracting suicide-related SDoH
from unstructured texts. These advancements have the potential to support early
identification of individuals at risk and inform more effective prevention
strategies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于语义独立子对话的分区方法，用于对话中的情感四元组提取，通过结构熵最小化算法减少噪声，并采用两步框架实现高效提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设情感元素均匀分布，但实际对话中存在多个语义独立的子对话，跨对话学习会引入噪声。

Method: 利用结构熵最小化算法分区对话，提出两步框架：先提取单句情感元素，再在子对话级别匹配四元组。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在DiaASQ任务中达到最优性能，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 通过分区和两步提取，有效减少了噪声并提升了性能。

Abstract: Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction (DiaASQ) aims to
extract all target-aspect-opinion-sentiment quadruples from a given
multi-round, multi-participant dialogue. Existing methods typically learn word
relations across entire dialogues, assuming a uniform distribution of sentiment
elements. However, we find that dialogues often contain multiple semantically
independent sub-dialogues without clear dependencies between them. Therefore,
learning word relationships across the entire dialogue inevitably introduces
additional noise into the extraction process. To address this, our method
focuses on partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues.
Achieving completeness while minimizing these sub-dialogues presents a
significant challenge. Simply partitioning based on reply relationships is
ineffective. Instead, we propose utilizing a structural entropy minimization
algorithm to partition the dialogues. This approach aims to preserve relevant
utterances while distinguishing irrelevant ones as much as possible.
Furthermore, we introduce a two-step framework for quadruple extraction: first
extracting individual sentiment elements at the utterance level, then matching
quadruples at the sub-dialogue level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with much lower
computational costs.

Motivation: 探索微调仅解码器LLM在AMR解析中的潜力，简化现有复杂方法。

Method: 微调四种LLM架构（Phi 3.5、Gemma 2、LLaMA 3.2、DeepSeek R1）并使用LDC2020T02测试集评估。

Result: LLaMA 3.2表现接近SOTA解析器（SMATCH F1: 0.804），Phi 3.5在结构有效性上更优。

Conclusion: 简单微调LLM可达到复杂SOTA解析器的性能，为AMR解析提供了新方向。

Abstract: Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism that encodes sentence
meaning as rooted, directed, acyclic graphs, where nodes represent concepts and
edges denote semantic relations. Finetuning decoder only Large Language Models
(LLMs) represent a promising novel straightfoward direction for AMR parsing.
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of finetuning four distinct LLM
architectures, Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled
using the LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0 test set. Our results have shown that
straightfoward finetuning of decoder only LLMs can achieve comparable
performance to complex State of the Art (SOTA) AMR parsers. Notably, LLaMA 3.2
demonstrates competitive performance against SOTA AMR parsers given a
straightforward finetuning approach. We achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804 on the full
LDC2020T02 test split, on par with APT + Silver (IBM) at 0.804 and approaching
Graphene Smatch (MBSE) at 0.854. Across our analysis, we also observed a
consistent pattern where LLaMA 3.2 leads in semantic performance while Phi 3.5
excels in structural validity.

Result: 实验表明Align-LoRA显著优于基线方法，验证了共享表征的重要性。

Conclusion: 多任务学习中，学习鲁棒的共享表征比隔离任务特定特征更有效，Align-LoRA为此提供了更简单高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is essential for adapting Large
Language Models (LLMs). In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a
diverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by
multi-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves
LoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural
diversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct
challenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head
architecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex
multi-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the
multi-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard
single-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly
competitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective
MTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not
isolating task-specific features. To validate this, we propose Align-LoRA,
which incorporates an explicit loss to align task representations within the
shared adapter space. Experiments confirm that Align-LoRA significantly
surpasses all baselines, establishing a simpler yet more effective paradigm for
adapting LLMs to multiple tasks. The code is available at

Result: 在Factify 2数据集上加权F1得分为0.84，显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 显式多模态推理有效，该方法在复杂场景中具有可扩展性和可解释性。

Abstract: The growing rate of multimodal misinformation, where claims are supported by
both text and images, poses significant challenges to fact-checking systems
that rely primarily on textual evidence. In this work, we have proposed a
unified framework for fine-grained multimodal fact verification called
"MultiCheck", designed to reason over structured textual and visual signals.
Our architecture combines dedicated encoders for text and images with a fusion
module that captures cross-modal relationships using element-wise interactions.
A classification head then predicts the veracity of a claim, supported by a
contrastive learning objective that encourages semantic alignment between
claim-evidence pairs in a shared latent space. We evaluate our approach on the
Factify 2 dataset, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.84, substantially
outperforming the baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of
explicit multimodal reasoning and demonstrate the potential of our approach for
scalable and interpretable fact-checking in complex, real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的知识有限，检索增强生成（RAG）能补充其知识，但长上下文导致熵增长和注意力稀释，影响性能。

Method: 提出BEE-RAG框架，利用熵不变性平衡上下文熵，分离注意力敏感性与上下文长度；引入零样本推理策略和自适应微调机制。

Result: 在多个RAG任务中验证了BEE-RAG的有效性。

Conclusion: BEE-RAG通过熵工程优化RAG性能，适用于不同上下文长度。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs),
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical approach to
supplement the inherent knowledge limitations of LLMs. However, due to the
typically large volume of retrieved information, RAG tends to operate with long
context lengths. From the perspective of entropy engineering, we identify
unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval
context as significant factors affecting RAG performance. In this paper, we
propose the balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework, which improves
the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the
principle of entropy invariance. By leveraging balanced context entropy to
reformulate attention dynamics, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from
context length, ensuring a stable entropy level. Building upon this, we
introduce a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and a
parameter-efficient adaptive fine-tuning mechanism to obtain the optimal
balancing factor for different settings. Extensive experiments across multiple
RAG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BEE-RAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型对输入信息位置的敏感性，发现模型倾向于关注序列开头和结尾的内容（称为注意力盆地现象），而忽略中间部分。

Method: 提出AttnRank框架，通过校准集估计模型的注意力偏好，并重排输入序列以将关键信息置于高注意力位置。

Result: 在多项任务中，AttnRank显著提升了10种不同架构和规模的大语言模型的性能。

Conclusion: AttnRank是一种无需训练、即插即用的通用方法，能有效优化模型性能。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to
the contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the
mechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a
consistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a
sequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples),
models systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and
end of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our
analysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical
information is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we
introduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i)
estimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small
calibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to
align the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is
a model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context
learning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements
across 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without
modifying model parameters or training procedures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试常忽略对大语言模型伦理推理的评估，而医疗领域需要严格的伦理考量。

Method: 基于Principlism理论，构建包含选择题和开放式问题的数据集，并由医学专家验证。

Result: 实验显示模型在动态应用伦理原则时表现不佳，尤其是Beneficence原则。前沿闭源模型表现最佳，医学领域微调可提升伦理能力。

Conclusion: PrinciplismQA为诊断模型伦理弱点提供了可扩展框架，推动更平衡和负责任的医疗AI发展。

Abstract: The integration of large language models into healthcare necessitates a
rigorous evaluation of their ethical reasoning, an area current benchmarks
often overlook. We introduce PrinciplismQA, a comprehensive benchmark with
3,648 questions designed to systematically assess LLMs' alignment with core
medical ethics. Grounded in Principlism, our benchmark features a high-quality
dataset. This includes multiple-choice questions curated from authoritative
textbooks and open-ended questions sourced from authoritative medical ethics
case study literature, all validated by medical experts. Our experiments reveal
a significant gap between models' ethical knowledge and their practical
application, especially in dynamically applying ethical principles to
real-world scenarios. Most LLMs struggle with dilemmas concerning Beneficence,
often over-emphasizing other principles. Frontier closed-source models, driven
by strong general capabilities, currently lead the benchmark. Notably, medical
domain fine-tuning can enhance models' overall ethical competence, but further
progress requires better alignment with medical ethical knowledge.
PrinciplismQA offers a scalable framework to diagnose these specific ethical
weaknesses, paving the way for more balanced and responsible medical AI.

Method: 提出MulCoT-RD模型，采用“教师-助理-学生”蒸馏范式：1）利用高性能MLLM生成初始推理数据集；2）训练中等规模的助理模型；3）联合训练轻量级学生模型完成推理与分类。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，仅3B参数的MulCoT-RD在JMSRC任务中表现优异，同时具备强泛化能力和可解释性。

Conclusion: MulCoT-RD为资源受限环境下的多模态情感分析提供了高效解决方案，兼顾性能与轻量化。

Abstract: The surge in rich multimodal content on social media platforms has greatly
advanced Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), with Large Language Models (LLMs)
further accelerating progress in this field. Current approaches primarily
leverage the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of parameter-heavy
(Multimodal) LLMs for sentiment classification, overlooking autonomous
multimodal sentiment reasoning generation in resource-constrained environments.
Therefore, we focus on the Resource-Limited Joint Multimodal Sentiment
Reasoning and Classification task, JMSRC, which simultaneously performs
multimodal sentiment reasoning chain generation and sentiment classification
only with a lightweight model. We propose a Multimodal Chain-of-Thought
Reasoning Distillation model, MulCoT-RD, designed for JMSRC that employs a
"Teacher-Assistant-Student" distillation paradigm to address deployment
constraints in resource-limited environments. We first leverage a
high-performance Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate the initial
reasoning dataset and train a medium-sized assistant model with a multi-task
learning mechanism. A lightweight student model is jointly trained to perform
efficient multimodal sentiment reasoning generation and classification.
Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that MulCoT-RD with only 3B
parameters achieves strong performance on JMSRC, while exhibiting robust
generalization and enhanced interpretability.

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效识别功能网络和关键神经元，实现高效剪枝。

Abstract: Structured pruning is one of the representative techniques for compressing
large language models (LLMs) to reduce GPU memory consumption and accelerate
inference speed. It offers significant practical value in improving the
efficiency of LLMs in real-world applications. Current structured pruning
methods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units
and pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the
interaction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the
functionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional
architecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation.
Inspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and
functional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and
propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within
LLMs in this study. To achieve this, we treat an LLM as a digital brain and
decompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional
brain networks in neuroimaging data. Afterwards, an LLM is pruned by preserving
the key neurons within these functional networks. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify and locate
functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CodeBoost是一种后训练框架，通过纯代码片段提升代码LLMs，无需人工标注指令。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型依赖人工标注的指令对进行强化学习，但高质量指令收集困难且难以扩展，而代码片段资源丰富。

Method: CodeBoost包含最大团选择、双向预测、错误感知预测、异构增强和异构奖励五个关键组件。

Result: 实验表明，CodeBoost在多个代码LLMs和基准测试中均能提升性能。

Conclusion: CodeBoost是一种可扩展且有效的训练框架。

Abstract: Code large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for
building efficient and automated coding pipelines. Existing models are
typically post-trained using reinforcement learning (RL) from general-purpose
LLMs using "human instruction-final answer" pairs, where the instructions are
usually from manual annotations. However, collecting high-quality coding
instructions is both labor-intensive and difficult to scale. On the other hand,
code snippets are abundantly available from various sources. This imbalance
presents a major bottleneck in instruction-based post-training. We propose
CodeBoost, a post-training framework that enhances code LLMs purely from code
snippets, without relying on human-annotated instructions. CodeBoost introduces
the following key components: (1) maximum-clique curation, which selects a
representative and diverse training corpus from code; (2) bi-directional
prediction, which enables the model to learn from both forward and backward
prediction objectives; (3) error-aware prediction, which incorporates learning
signals from both correct and incorrect outputs; (4) heterogeneous
augmentation, which diversifies the training distribution to enrich code
semantics; and (5) heterogeneous rewarding, which guides model learning through
multiple reward types including format correctness and execution feedback from
both successes and failures. Extensive experiments across several code LLMs and
benchmarks verify that CodeBoost consistently improves performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable and effective training pipeline.

TL;DR: 论文挑战了“级联失败”假设，提出“晚期脆弱性”现象，并引入ASCoT方法以针对性解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）推理链的可靠性，尤其是错误在不同阶段的影响。

Method: 提出ASCoT方法，包含自适应验证管理器（AVM）和多视角自校正引擎（MSCE），针对晚期脆弱性进行校正。

Result: ASCoT在GSM8K和MATH等基准测试中表现优异，超越标准CoT。

Conclusion: 强调诊断LLM推理失败模式的重要性，提倡转向自适应校正机制。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these
reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading
failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur
early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through
systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive
phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later
stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer
than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific
vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought
(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive
Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective
Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score
function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the
reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and
prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are
identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the
failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH
demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong
baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of
diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift
from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware
correction mechanisms.

Result: 实验表明，生成的合成数据质量更高，专用代理在元评审任务中优于通用LLM助手，且能有效提升评审效率。

Conclusion: 对话代理在元评审中具有实际应用潜力，未来可进一步优化和推广。

Abstract: Meta-reviewing is a pivotal stage in the peer-review process, serving as the
final step in determining whether a paper is recommended for acceptance. Prior
research on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over
review reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a
decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing
them within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that
decision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue
agents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for
realizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely,
we first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by
generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a
self-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert
domains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality
synthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training
meta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue
agents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform
\emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our
agents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness
in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\footnote{Code and Data:

Result: 在39M到1.3B参数范围内，SONAR-LLM表现出竞争性的生成质量。

Conclusion: SONAR-LLM在保留语义抽象的同时，通过混合目标提升了生成效率和质量，并开源了代码和预训练模型。

Abstract: The recently proposed Large Concept Model (LCM) generates text by predicting
a sequence of sentence-level embeddings and training with either mean-squared
error or diffusion objectives. We present SONAR-LLM, a decoder-only transformer
that "thinks" in the same continuous SONAR embedding space, yet is supervised
through token-level cross-entropy propagated via the frozen SONAR decoder. This
hybrid objective retains the semantic abstraction of LCM while eliminating its
diffusion sampler and restoring a likelihood-based training signal. Across
model sizes from 39M to 1.3B parameters, SONAR-LLM attains competitive
generation quality. We report scaling trends, ablations, benchmark results, and
release the complete training code and all pretrained checkpoints to foster
reproducibility and future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理中常因反射行为导致过度思考，增加token使用和推理成本，降低实用性。

Method: 提出CGRS方法，动态抑制高置信度时的反射触发，无需重新训练或修改架构。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，CGRS平均减少18.5%至41.9%的token使用，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: CGRS在模型架构和规模上均表现一致，为高效推理提供了实用价值。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) employ long chain-of-thought
reasoning with complex reflection behaviors, typically signaled by specific
trigger words (e.g., "Wait" and "Alternatively") to enhance performance.
However, these reflection behaviors can lead to the overthinking problem where
the generation of redundant reasoning steps that unnecessarily increase token
usage, raise inference costs, and reduce practical utility. In this paper, we
propose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that
mitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS
operates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection
triggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby
preventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our
approach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural
modifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive
generation pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks
(i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it
reduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy.
It also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across
model architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3
family) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value
for efficient reasoning.

Motivation: 研究旨在分析可调整手语虚拟形象对用户体验和可理解性的影响，以改进手语交互系统的设计。

Method: 通过专家德国手语（DGS）用户与可调整和不可调整虚拟形象的交互实验，评估了用户体验、可理解性和接受度。

Result: 用户偏好可调整设置，但未显著提升用户体验或可理解性；系统在功能和交互设计上存在问题。

Conclusion: 个性化不足以保证手语虚拟形象的可理解性，需改进动画质量和交互界面，并采用参与式设计。

Abstract: This paper presents an investigation into the impact of adding adjustment
features to an existing sign language (SL) avatar on a Microsoft Hololens 2
device. Through a detailed analysis of interactions of expert German Sign
Language (DGS) users with both adjustable and non-adjustable avatars in a
specific use case, this study identifies the key factors influencing the
comprehensibility, the user experience (UX), and the acceptability of such a
system. Despite user preference for adjustable settings, no significant
improvements in UX or comprehensibility were observed, which remained at low
levels, amid missing SL elements (mouthings and facial expressions) and
implementation issues (indistinct hand shapes, lack of feedback and menu
positioning). Hedonic quality was rated higher than pragmatic quality,
indicating that users found the system more emotionally or aesthetically
pleasing than functionally useful. Stress levels were higher for the adjustable
avatar, reflecting lower performance, greater effort and more frustration.
Additionally, concerns were raised about whether the Hololens adjustment
gestures are intuitive and easy to familiarise oneself with. While
acceptability of the concept of adjustability was generally positive, it was
strongly dependent on usability and animation quality. This study highlights
that personalisation alone is insufficient, and that SL avatars must be
comprehensible by default. Key recommendations include enhancing mouthing and
facial animation, improving interaction interfaces, and applying participatory
design.

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and 'deep research' systems aim
to enable autonomous search processes where Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively refine outputs. However, applying these systems to domain-specific
professional search, such as biomedical research, presents challenges, as
automated systems may reduce user involvement and misalign with expert
information needs. Professional search tasks often demand high levels of user
expertise and transparency. The BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge, using
expert-formulated questions, can serve as a platform to study these issues. We
explored the performance of current reasoning and nonreasoning LLMs like
Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, o4-mini and DeepSeek-R1. A key aspect of our
methodology was a self-feedback mechanism where LLMs generated, evaluated, and
then refined their outputs for query expansion and for multiple answer types
(yes/no, factoid, list, ideal). We investigated whether this iterative
self-correction improves performance and if reasoning models are more capable
of generating useful feedback. Preliminary results indicate varied performance
for the self-feedback strategy across models and tasks. This work offers
insights into LLM self-correction and informs future work on comparing the
effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback with direct human expert input in these
search systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs因训练数据偏向高资源语言（如英语和中文）而表现出的文化偏见问题。

Method: 采用开放式多选题格式，避免预设选项，减少猜测和格式偏见，并通过多语言提示变体评估语言偏见。

Result: 评估显示，不同LLMs在文化理解上存在显著差异，突显了开发文化基础和语言包容性基准的紧迫性。

Conclusion: MyCulture为LLMs的文化评估提供了更公平和全面的方法，强调了文化多样性在模型开发中的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit cultural biases due to training
data dominated by high-resource languages like English and Chinese. This poses
challenges for accurately representing and evaluating diverse cultural
contexts, particularly in low-resource language settings. To address this, we
introduce MyCulture, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs on
Malaysian culture across six pillars: arts, attire, customs, entertainment,
food, and religion presented in Bahasa Melayu. Unlike conventional benchmarks,
MyCulture employs a novel open-ended multiple-choice question format without
predefined options, thereby reducing guessing and mitigating format bias. We
provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of this open-ended
structure in improving both fairness and discriminative power. Furthermore, we
analyze structural bias by comparing model performance on structured versus
free-form outputs, and assess language bias through multilingual prompt
variations. Our evaluation across a range of regional and international LLMs
reveals significant disparities in cultural comprehension, highlighting the
urgent need for culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks in
the development and assessment of LLMs.

Abstract: Existing evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on static benchmarks is
vulnerable to data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, critical issues
that obscure true model capabilities. To address this, we introduce LLMEval-3,
a framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. LLMEval-3 is built on a proprietary
bank of 220k graduate-level questions, from which it dynamically samples unseen
test sets for each evaluation run. Its automated pipeline ensures integrity via
contamination-resistant data curation, a novel anti-cheating architecture, and
a calibrated LLM-as-a-judge process achieving 90% agreement with human experts,
complemented by a relative ranking system for fair comparison. An 20-month
longitudinal study of nearly 50 leading models reveals a performance ceiling on
knowledge memorization and exposes data contamination vulnerabilities
undetectable by static benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional
robustness in ranking stability and consistency, providing strong empirical
validation for the dynamic evaluation paradigm. LLMEval-3 offers a robust and
credible methodology for assessing the true capabilities of LLMs beyond
leaderboard scores, promoting the development of more trustworthy evaluation
standards.

Method: TASE包含35,927个评估实例，涵盖token感知和结构理解两大类任务，并采用可扩展的合成数据生成管道进行训练。评估了30多个领先的商业和开源LLM。

Result: 人类表现显著优于当前LLM，揭示了LLM在token级别推理上的持续弱点。

Conclusion: TASE为未来改进低级别语言理解和跨语言泛化提供了新的诊断工具，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
on high-level semantic tasks, they often struggle with fine-grained,
token-level understanding and structural reasoning--capabilities that are
essential for applications requiring precision and control. We introduce TASE,
a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to perceive and
reason about token-level information across languages. TASE covers 10 tasks
under two core categories: token awareness and structural understanding,
spanning Chinese, English, and Korean, with a 35,927-instance evaluation set
and a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline for training. Tasks include
character counting, token alignment, syntactic structure parsing, and length
constraint satisfaction. We evaluate over 30 leading commercial and open-source
LLMs, including O3, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and DeepSeek-R1, and train a
custom Qwen2.5-14B model using the GRPO training method. Results show that
human performance significantly outpaces current LLMs, revealing persistent
weaknesses in token-level reasoning. TASE sheds light on these limitations and
provides a new diagnostic lens for future improvements in low-level language
understanding and cross-lingual generalization. Our code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/cyzcz/Tase .

TL;DR: 论文系统分析并比较了多种创造力衡量指标，发现它们一致性有限，各有所长，但存在局限性，需更稳健的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同创造力衡量指标在多个创意领域中的表现，以揭示其局限性和不一致性。

Method: 系统分析创造力指数、困惑度、句法模板和LLM作为评委等指标在创意写作、非常规问题解决和研究构思中的应用。

Result: 各指标一致性有限，分别捕捉创造力的不同维度，且存在如词汇多样性、模型信心敏感性和概念创造力不足等局限性。

Conclusion: 需开发更稳健、通用的评估框架，以更贴合人类对创造力的判断。

Abstract: We systematically examine, analyze, and compare representative creativity
measures--creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, and
LLM-as-a-Judge--across diverse creative domains, including creative writing,
unconventional problem-solving, and research ideation. Our analyses reveal that
these metrics exhibit limited consistency, capturing different dimensions of
creativity. We highlight key limitations, including the creativity index's
focus on lexical diversity, perplexity's sensitivity to model confidence, and
syntactic templates' inability to capture conceptual creativity. Additionally,
LLM-as-a-Judge shows instability and bias. Our findings underscore the need for
more robust, generalizable evaluation frameworks that better align with human
judgments of creativity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Logic-Augmented Generation (LAG)方法，通过系统化问题分解和依赖感知推理增强大语言模型的知识密集型任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在知识密集型任务中存在幻觉问题，现有检索增强生成方法在复杂推理场景中表现不足。

Method: LAG将复杂问题分解为原子子问题，按逻辑依赖顺序解决，并引入逻辑终止机制防止错误传播。

Result: 实验表明LAG显著提升推理鲁棒性，减少幻觉，并更符合人类认知。

Conclusion: LAG为现有检索增强生成系统提供了更优的替代方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive
tasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring
specialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates
this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning
scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of
structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from
\textit{Discours de la m\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented
Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through
systematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically,
LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by
logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers
to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise
grounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a
logical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering
unanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive
reasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified
responses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG
significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns
LLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to
existing RAG systems.

TL;DR: 论文通过20 Questions游戏评估LLMs的地理偏见，发现模型在推断Global North和West实体时表现更好，且语言对表现差距影响较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在主动提问时表现出的隐性偏见，而非直接通过人工设计的问题触发防护机制。

Method: 使用Geo20Q+数据集，在七种语言和两种游戏配置下测试LLMs的地理表现差异。

Result: LLMs在Global North和West实体推断中表现更优，Wikipedia页面浏览量和预训练语料频率无法完全解释这种差异。

Conclusion: 自由形式的评估框架能揭示LLMs中的隐性偏见，语言对表现差距影响有限。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit
biases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their
pre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted
questions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave
when they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a
multi-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We
systematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction
using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally
significant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We
test popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and
unlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese,
French, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs
are substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North
than the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While
Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with
performance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the
language in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps.
These findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation
frameworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard
prompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals
over multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in
their reasoning processes. We release the dataset (Geo20Q+) and code at
https://sites.google.com/view/llmbias20q/home.

TL;DR: CoCoLex是一种解码策略，通过动态结合模型生成的词汇分布和上下文复制分布，提高法律文本生成的忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在法律领域有潜力，但存在生成不忠实或幻觉输出的问题，现有方法无法确保上下文有效整合。

Method: 提出CoCoLex解码策略，基于模型置信度动态结合生成和复制分布。

Result: 在五个法律基准测试中，CoCoLex优于现有方法，尤其在长文本生成任务中。

Conclusion: CoCoLex通过增强上下文忠实性，有效提升了法律文本生成的质量。

Abstract: Due to their ability to process long and complex contexts, LLMs can offer key
benefits to the Legal domain, but their adoption has been hindered by their
tendency to generate unfaithful, ungrounded, or hallucinatory outputs. While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation offers a promising solution by grounding
generations in external knowledge, it offers no guarantee that the provided
context will be effectively integrated. To address this, context-aware decoding
strategies have been proposed to amplify the influence of relevant context, but
they usually do not explicitly enforce faithfulness to the context. In this
work, we introduce Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Legal Text
Generation (CoCoLex)-a decoding strategy that dynamically interpolates the
model produced vocabulary distribution with a distribution derived based on
copying from the context. CoCoLex encourages direct copying based on the
model's confidence, ensuring greater fidelity to the source. Experimental
results on five legal benchmarks demonstrate that CoCoLex outperforms existing
context-aware decoding methods, particularly in long-form generation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于频率的不确定性量化方法，用于黑箱设置下的多选问答任务，通过共形预测确保覆盖保证，提升LLMs的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在多选问答中表现优异，但其不可靠性（如幻觉和过度自信）限制了在高风险领域的应用。

Method: 采用频率不确定性量化方法，通过多次独立采样模型的输出分布，计算预测熵（PE），并利用共形预测提供覆盖保证。

Result: 在六个LLMs和四个数据集上的实验表明，频率PE优于基于logit的PE，并能有效控制误覆盖率。

Conclusion: 该方法为黑箱场景下的可靠不确定性量化提供了模型无关的框架，增强了LLMs在实际应用中的可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), but their inherent unreliability,
such as hallucination and overconfidence, limits their application in high-risk
domains. To address this, we propose a frequency-based uncertainty
quantification method under black-box settings, leveraging conformal prediction
(CP) to ensure provable coverage guarantees. Our approach involves multiple
independent samplings of the model's output distribution for each input, with
the most frequent sample serving as a reference to calculate predictive entropy
(PE). Experimental evaluations across six LLMs and four datasets (MedMCQA,
MedQA, MMLU, MMLU-Pro) demonstrate that frequency-based PE outperforms
logit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions, as
measured by AUROC. Furthermore, the method effectively controls the empirical
miscoverage rate under user-specified risk levels, validating that sampling
frequency can serve as a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in
black-box scenarios. This work provides a distribution-free model-agnostic
framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in MCQA with guaranteed
coverage, enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications.

TL;DR: 研究发现，未对齐的多语言大语言模型（MLLMs）在政治观点上几乎没有显著的跨语言差异，且政治对齐后观点在所有语言中几乎一致变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨跨文化政治观点差异是否在多语言大语言模型中表现为跨语言差异。

Method: 通过提示MLLMs对政治声明表达（不）同意，评估其观点，并在对齐前后进行比较。

Result: 未对齐模型的政治观点跨语言差异极少，对齐后观点在所有语言中几乎一致变化。

Conclusion: 在西方语言背景下，政治观点在语言间转移，突显了实现MLLMs的社会语言、文化和政治对齐的挑战。

Abstract: Public opinion surveys show cross-cultural differences in political opinions
between socio-cultural contexts. However, there is no clear evidence whether
these differences translate to cross-lingual differences in multilingual large
language models (MLLMs). We analyze whether opinions transfer between languages
or whether there are separate opinions for each language in MLLMs of various
sizes across five Western languages. We evaluate MLLMs' opinions by prompting
them to report their (dis)agreement with political statements from voting
advice applications. To better understand the interaction between languages in
the models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left
or right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data
only. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant
cross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect. The political
alignment shifts opinions almost uniformly across all five languages. We
conclude that in Western language contexts, political opinions transfer between
languages, demonstrating the challenges in achieving explicit socio-linguistic,
cultural, and political alignment of MLLMs.

Motivation: 高质量、高难度的数学训练数据稀缺，现有合成方法依赖模板，缺乏多样性和可扩展性。

Method: 从PlanetMath随机采样概念-解释对生成新问题，采用强化学习优化问题结构、推理复杂度和答案一致性。

Result: 在五个基准测试中表现优于基线，尤其在长链推理任务中。

Conclusion: MathSmith展示了高难度合成数据在提升语言模型推理能力中的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved substantial progress in mathematical
reasoning, yet their advancement is limited by the scarcity of high-quality,
high-difficulty training data. Existing synthesis methods largely rely on
transforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability.
We propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging
mathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing
problems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling
concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and
avoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined
strategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts
reinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning
complexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated
under autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity,
encouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with
long-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks,
categorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025,
OlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines
under both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused
variant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts.
Overall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and
transferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in
advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 现有奖励模型存在规则奖励不鲁棒和模型奖励易受攻击的问题，需要一种更稳健的解决方案。

Method: 提出Cooper框架，结合规则奖励的高精度和动态构建正负样本对优化奖励模型，并引入混合标注策略和基于参考的奖励建模范式。

Result: 实验显示Cooper缓解了奖励攻击，并在Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct上实现了0.54%的平均准确率提升。

Conclusion: 动态更新奖励模型是应对奖励攻击的有效方法，为奖励模型与强化学习的更好结合提供了参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
reasoning tasks, where reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a key algorithm
for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. Currently, there are two mainstream
reward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both
approaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while
model-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues,
we propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework
that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper
leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct
responses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample
pairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness
and mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we
introduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately
generates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based
reward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as
input. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which
achieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same
size. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our
experiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also
improves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in
average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that
dynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking,
providing a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型在具身推理中的能力，填补现有基准的不足，特别是动态能力获取和自主协调策略的需求。

Method: 通过文本环境表示建模连续物理属性和复杂空间关系，覆盖1,500个家庭和工业场景，评估模型在工具推理和隐式协作中的表现。

Result: 模型在显式指令下表现良好（85-96%成功率），但在动态约束下性能显著下降（工具推理56-85%，隐式协作63-85%），多任务失败率超50%。完整环境信息反而降低协调性能。

Conclusion: 具身推理对当前模型构成根本性挑战，OmniEAR为评估和推进具身AI系统提供了严格基准。

Abstract: Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for
embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about
physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied
tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit
collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire
capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task
demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous
physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios
spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals
severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while
achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to
56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound
tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental
information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter
task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically
(0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing
fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied
reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can
address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and
advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the
supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Method: 提出了一种综合考虑事实精确性、详细程度和相关性的奖励函数，并应用于在线强化学习。

Result: 在六个长事实性基准测试中，模型平均减少了23.1%的幻觉率，详细程度提高了23%，且未降低回答的有用性。

Conclusion: 新奖励函数有效提升了模型的事实推理能力，解决了奖励黑客问题。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex
reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially
more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form
factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a
key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting
poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification
methods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks
such as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we
find that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to
reward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant
responses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the
factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies
online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form
factuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average
reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in
answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.

Result: 探针方法在样本和数据集层面均能有效捕捉说服动态，某些情况下甚至优于基于提示的方法。

Conclusion: 线性探针是研究复杂行为（如欺骗和操纵）的高效工具，尤其适用于多轮对话和大规模数据集分析。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to
persuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is
limited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing
model representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model
user sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to
study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage
insights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of
persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.
Despite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of
persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can
identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where
persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show
that in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,
probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such
as when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible
avenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and
manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset
analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.

Result: 在波斯语语料库上取得最佳结果：压缩率提升12%，ParsGLUE得分提高5.4个百分点，对ZWNJ损坏的鲁棒性提升53%，形态边界F1得分为73.8%。

Conclusion: 分层动态分块为形态丰富语言提供了一种无需显式监督的有效分词方案，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Byte-level language models eliminate fragile tokenizers but face
computational challenges in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), where words
span many bytes. We propose H-NET++, a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model that
learns linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training. Key
innovations include: (1) a lightweight Transformer context-mixer (1.9M
parameters) for cross-chunk attention, (2) a two-level latent hyper-prior for
document-level consistency, (3) specialized handling of orthographic artifacts
(e.g. Persian ZWNJ), and (4) curriculum-based training with staged sequence
lengths. On a 1.4B-token Persian corpus, H-NET++ achieves state-of-the-art
results: 0.159 BPB reduction versus BPE-based GPT-2-fa (12% better
compression), 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to ZWNJ
corruption, and 73.8% F1 on gold morphological boundaries. Our learned chunks
align with Persian morphology without explicit supervision, demonstrating that
hierarchical dynamic chunking provides an effective tokenizer-free solution for
MRLs while maintaining computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 研究机器人主动分享事件反应对人类感知其情感影响的效果，发现共享反应和特定延迟时间显著改变感知效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进机器人在社交环境中的功能，探索其反应行为对人类感知的影响。

Method: 设计两组实验：一组隔离反应元素，另一组测试不同反应延迟时间，分别与84名和110名参与者互动。

Result: 共享事件反应显著改变感知效果（p<0.05）；物理互动中，接近人类的反应时间（200ms）效果最佳。

Conclusion: 200ms延迟对小型非人形机器人最有效；100ms延迟则更适合让人类感觉对机器人影响最大。

Abstract: In an effort to improve how robots function in social contexts, this paper
investigates if a robot that actively shares a reaction to an event with a
human alters how the human perceives the robot's affective impact. To verify
this, we created two different test setups. One to highlight and isolate the
reaction element of affective robot expressions, and one to investigate the
effects of applying specific timing delays to a robot reacting to a physical
encounter with a human. The first test was conducted with two different groups
(n=84) of human observers, a test group and a control group both interacting
with the robot. The second test was performed with 110 participants using
increasingly longer reaction delays for the robot with every ten participants.
The results show a statistically significant change (p$<$.05) in perceived
affective impact for the robots when they react to an event shared with a human
observer rather than reacting at random. The result also shows for shared
physical interaction, the near-human reaction times from the robot are most
appropriate for the scenario. The paper concludes that a delay time around
200ms may render the biggest impact on human observers for small-sized
non-humanoid robots. It further concludes that a slightly shorter reaction time
around 100ms is most effective when the goal is to make the human observers
feel they made the biggest impact on the robot.

Motivation: 传统机器人控制依赖精确模型和预定义动作，难以适应复杂现实场景，而人类通过直觉和物理理解高效决策。

Conclusion: INTENTION框架显著提升机器人在多样化场景中的适应性和自主性。

Abstract: Traditional control and planning for robotic manipulation heavily rely on
precise physical models and predefined action sequences. While effective in
structured environments, such approaches often fail in real-world scenarios due
to modeling inaccuracies and struggle to generalize to novel tasks. In
contrast, humans intuitively interact with their surroundings, demonstrating
remarkable adaptability, making efficient decisions through implicit physical
understanding. In this work, we propose INTENTION, a novel framework enabling
robots with learned interactive intuition and autonomous manipulation in
diverse scenarios, by integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) based scene
reasoning with interaction-driven memory. We introduce Memory Graph to record
scenes from previous task interactions which embodies human-like understanding
and decision-making about different tasks in real world. Meanwhile, we design
an Intuitive Perceptor that extracts physical relations and affordances from
visual scenes. Together, these components empower robots to infer appropriate
interaction behaviors in new scenes without relying on repetitive instructions.

### [145] [Optimal Planning for Multi-Robot Simultaneous Area and Line Coverage Using Hierarchical Cyclic Merging Regulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04981)
*Tianyuan Zheng,Jingang Yi,Kaiyan Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分层循环合并调节（HCMR）的算法，用于解决多机器人双重覆盖问题，优化路径规划并减少任务时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多机器人在已知环境中同时覆盖线性特征和区域时的路径规划问题，兼顾服务（高成本）和探索（低成本）的双重功能需求。

Method: 采用分层循环合并调节（HCMR）算法，结合莫尔斯理论分析流形附着过程，通过循环合并搜索和边序列反向传播生成最优路径。

Result: HCMR算法显著优化了路径长度（至少10.0%）和任务时间（平均16.9%），并确保无冲突操作。

Conclusion: HCMR算法在固定扫描方向下具有最优性，能有效解决双重覆盖问题，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The double coverage problem focuses on determining efficient, collision-free
routes for multiple robots to simultaneously cover linear features (e.g.,
surface cracks or road routes) and survey areas (e.g., parking lots or local
regions) in known environments. In these problems, each robot carries two
functional roles: service (linear feature footprint coverage) and exploration
(complete area coverage). Service has a smaller operational footprint but
incurs higher costs (e.g., time) compared to exploration. We present optimal
planning algorithms for the double coverage problems using hierarchical cyclic
merging regulation (HCMR). To reduce the complexity for optimal planning
solutions, we analyze the manifold attachment process during graph traversal
from a Morse theory perspective. We show that solutions satisfying minimum path
length and collision-free constraints must belong to a Morse-bounded
collection. To identify this collection, we introduce the HCMR algorithm. In
HCMR, cyclic merging search regulates traversal behavior, while edge sequence
back propagation converts these regulations into graph edge traversal
sequences. Incorporating balanced partitioning, the optimal sequence is
selected to generate routes for each robot. We prove the optimality of the HCMR
algorithm under a fixed sweep direction. The multi-robot simulation results
demonstrate that the HCMR algorithm significantly improves planned path length
by at least 10.0%, reduces task time by at least 16.9% in average, and ensures
conflict-free operation compared to other state-of-the-art planning methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的层次化DDPG（HDDPG）算法，通过高层和低层策略解决迷宫导航中稀疏奖励、探索效率低和长时规划问题，显著提升了成功率和平均奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DDPG算法在迷宫导航中表现不佳，主要由于稀疏奖励、探索效率低和长时规划困难，导致成功率和奖励较低。

Method: HDDPG采用高层策略生成子目标，低层策略执行动作；结合离策略校正、自适应参数噪声和奖励重塑等技术优化性能。

Result: 在ROS和Gazebo实验中，HDDPG相比基线算法将成功率提升至少56.59%，平均奖励提高至少519.03。

Conclusion: HDDPG有效解决了迷宫导航中的关键问题，显著优于标准DDPG及其变体。

Abstract: Maze navigation is a fundamental challenge in robotics, requiring agents to
traverse complex environments efficiently. While the Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze
navigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and
long-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and
average rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To
address these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG
(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The
high-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate
subgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The
low-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates
primitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal
assigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with
off-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical
experiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to
improve exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is
employed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including
gradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve
robustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical
simulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and
Gazebo. Regarding the three distinct final targets in autonomous maze
navigation tasks, HDDPG significantly overcomes the limitations of standard
DDPG and its variants, improving the success rate by at least 56.59% and
boosting the average reward by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline
algorithms.

Result: 在HM3D数据集上表现优于现有方法，并在四足机器人上验证了实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过主动感知和记忆利用，显著提升了语言驱动导航的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual navigation in unknown environments based solely on natural language
descriptions is a key capability for intelligent robots. In this work, we
propose a navigation framework built upon off-the-shelf Visual Language Models
(VLMs), enhanced with two human-inspired mechanisms: perspective-based active
grounding, which dynamically adjusts the robot's viewpoint for improved visual
inspection, and historical memory backtracking, which enables the system to
retain and re-evaluate uncertain observations over time. Unlike existing
approaches that passively rely on incidental visual inputs, our method actively
optimizes perception and leverages memory to resolve ambiguity, significantly
improving vision-language grounding in complex, unseen environments. Our
framework operates in a zero-shot manner, achieving strong generalization to
diverse and open-ended language descriptions without requiring labeled data or
model fine-tuning. Experimental results on Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in language-driven
object navigation. We further demonstrate its practicality through real-world
deployment on a quadruped robot, achieving robust and effective navigation
performance.

Result: 研究提供了不同模拟场景下捷径方法的性能对比，并展示了组合策略的最佳性能-运行时间平衡。

Conclusion: 本文为多机械臂系统的轨迹优化提供了实用的捷径方法选择和组合策略，提升了运动规划的效率和平滑性。

Abstract: Generating high-quality motion plans for multiple robot arms is challenging
due to the high dimensionality of the system and the potential for inter-arm
collisions. Traditional motion planning methods often produce motions that are
suboptimal in terms of smoothness and execution time for multi-arm systems.
Post-processing via shortcutting is a common approach to improve motion quality
for efficient and smooth execution. However, in multi-arm scenarios, optimizing
one arm's motion must not introduce collisions with other arms. Although
existing multi-arm planning works often use some form of shortcutting
techniques, their exact methodology and impact on performance are often vaguely
described. In this work, we present a comprehensive study quantitatively
comparing existing shortcutting methods for multi-arm trajectories across
diverse simulated scenarios. We carefully analyze the pros and cons of each
shortcutting method and propose two simple strategies for combining these
methods to achieve the best performance-runtime tradeoff. Video, code, and
dataset are available at https://philip-huang.github.io/mr-shortcut/.

Abstract: External collisions to robot actuators typically pose risks to grasping
circular objects. This work presents a vision-based sensing module capable of
detecting collisions to maintain stable grasping with a soft gripper system.
The system employs an eye-in-palm camera with a broad field of view to
simultaneously monitor the motion of fingers and the grasped object.
Furthermore, we have developed a collision-rich grasping strategy to ensure the
stability and security of the entire dynamic grasping process. A physical soft
gripper was manufactured and affixed to a collaborative robotic arm to evaluate
the performance of the collision detection mechanism. An experiment regarding
testing the response time of the mechanism confirmed the system has the
capability to react to the collision instantaneously. A dodging test was
conducted to demonstrate the gripper can detect the direction and scale of
external collisions precisely.

humans to interpret, predict, and feel safe around them. This study
investigates the legibility of humanoid robot arm movements in a pointing task,
aiming to understand how humans predict robot intentions from truncated

touchscreen. Robot cues varied across conditions: gaze, pointing, and pointing
with congruent or incongruent gaze. Arm trajectories were stopped at 60\% or
80\% of their full length, and participants predicted the final target. We
tested the multimodal superiority and ocular primacy hypotheses, both of which
were supported by the experiment.

aims to study the distance effect on user perception in RTo, exploring the
potential of teleoperated robots for older adult care. We propose an evaluation

that of locally operated robots. We have designed a specific protocol
consisting of multiple questionnaires, along with a dedicated software
architecture using the Robotics Operating System (ROS) and Unity. The results
revealed no statistically significant differences between the local and remote
robot conditions, suggesting that robots may be a viable alternative to
traditional local control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自驱动实验室中机器人集成和自动化增加了安全复杂性，尤其是火灾和PPE合规性问题，需要一种高效的安全监控系统。

Method: 系统整合RGB、深度和红外摄像头，利用VLM进行决策，实时驱动机器人远离危险并发出警告。

Result: 在真实SDL环境中测试，Chemist Eye 对安全危险的识别和决策性能分别达到97%和95%。

Conclusion: Chemist Eye 能有效提升SDL的安全性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The integration of robotics and automation into self-driving laboratories
(SDLs) can introduce additional safety complexities, in addition to those that
already apply to conventional research laboratories. Personal protective
equipment (PPE) is an essential requirement for ensuring the safety and
well-being of workers in laboratories, self-driving or otherwise. Fires are
another important risk factor in chemical laboratories. In SDLs, fires that
occur close to mobile robots, which use flammable lithium batteries, could have
increased severity. Here, we present Chemist Eye, a distributed safety
monitoring system designed to enhance situational awareness in SDLs. The system
integrates multiple stations equipped with RGB, depth, and infrared cameras,
designed to monitor incidents in SDLs. Chemist Eye is also designed to spot
workers who have suffered a potential accident or medical emergency, PPE
compliance and fire hazards. To do this, Chemist Eye uses decision-making
driven by a vision-language model (VLM). Chemist Eye is designed for seamless
integration, enabling real-time communication with robots. Based on the VLM
recommendations, the system attempts to drive mobile robots away from potential
fire locations, exits, or individuals not wearing PPE, and issues audible
warnings where necessary. It also integrates with third-party messaging
platforms to provide instant notifications to lab personnel. We tested Chemist
Eye with real-world data from an SDL equipped with three mobile robots and
found that the spotting of possible safety hazards and decision-making
performances reached 97 % and 95 %, respectively.

Motivation: 解决机器人服装操作中因高维度和类别内变化导致的泛化问题。

Method: 提出FCBV-Net，利用3D点云和冻结的几何特征预测双手动作价值，下游可训练组件学习任务策略。

Result: 在模拟实验中，FCBV-Net表现优于基线方法，泛化效率下降仅11.5%，最终覆盖率达89%。

Conclusion: 几何理解与动作价值学习的解耦能有效提升类别级泛化能力。

Abstract: Category-level generalization for robotic garment manipulation, such as
bimanual smoothing, remains a significant hurdle due to high dimensionality,
complex dynamics, and intra-category variations. Current approaches often
struggle, either overfitting with concurrently learned visual features for a
specific instance or, despite category-level perceptual generalization, failing
to predict the value of synergistic bimanual actions. We propose the
Feature-Conditioned Bimanual Value Network (FCBV-Net), operating on 3D point
clouds to specifically enhance category-level policy generalization for garment
smoothing. FCBV-Net conditions bimanual action value prediction on pre-trained,
frozen dense geometric features, ensuring robustness to intra-category garment
variations. Trainable downstream components then learn a task-specific policy
using these static features. In simulated GarmentLab experiments with the
CLOTH3D dataset, FCBV-Net demonstrated superior category-level generalization.
It exhibited only an 11.5% efficiency drop (Steps80) on unseen garments
compared to 96.2% for a 2D image-based baseline, and achieved 89% final
coverage, outperforming an 83% coverage from a 3D correspondence-based baseline
that uses identical per-point geometric features but a fixed primitive. These
results highlight that the decoupling of geometric understanding from bimanual
action value learning enables better category-level generalization.

Conclusion: TAVP通过任务感知的视觉表示生成，显著提升了多任务机器人操作的性能。

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models for multi-task robotic
manipulation commonly rely on static viewpoints and shared visual encoders,
which limit 3D perception and cause task interference, hindering robustness and
generalization. In this work, we propose Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a
framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating active view
planning with task-specific representation learning. TAVP employs an efficient
exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively
acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both
representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world
in a task-aware way, TAVP generates more complete and discriminative visual
representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across
a wide array of manipulation challenges. Extensive experiments on RLBench tasks
show that our proposed TAVP model achieves superior performance over
state-of-the-art fixed-view approaches. Visual results and code are provided

child-robot interactions: 1) Initiating and maintaining engagement, 2) Lack of
robot expressivity and reciprocity, and 3) Unmet expectations. Our findings
show that children are naturally curious, and adept at interacting with a
robotic art performer. However, our observations emphasise the critical need to
optimise human-robot interaction (HRI) systems through careful consideration of

Abstract: Foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language

agentic applications and architectures. This includes initial efforts exploring
GPT-style interfaces to tooling, as well as more complex system where AI agents
are coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such
agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language
instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and
diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving
nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS
packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a
taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative
analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's

Motivation: 传统方法依赖预定义行为序列或行为树，无法满足实时动态需求，GhostShell旨在通过LLM实现灵活的行为编程。

Method: 采用流式XML函数解析器、动态函数接口映射器和多通道调度器，支持同步和异步函数调用。

Result: 在34个真实任务中，GhostShell的行为正确性达0.85，响应速度比原生API快66倍，且在多模态任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: GhostShell为实时行为编程提供了高效解决方案，适用于复杂多机器人系统。

Abstract: We present GhostShell, a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) to enable streaming and concurrent behavioral programming for embodied
systems. In contrast to conventional methods that rely on pre-scheduled action
sequences or behavior trees, GhostShell drives embodied systems to act
on-the-fly by issuing function calls incrementally as tokens are streamed from
the LLM. GhostShell features a streaming XML function token parser, a dynamic
function interface mapper, and a multi-channel scheduler that orchestrates
intra-channel synchronous and inter-channel asynchronous function calls,
thereby coordinating serial-parallel embodied actions across multiple robotic
components as directed by the LLM. We evaluate GhostShell on our robot
prototype COCO through comprehensive grounded experiments across 34 real-world
interaction tasks and multiple LLMs. The results demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art Behavioral Correctness Metric of 0.85 with Claude-4
Sonnet and up to 66X faster response times compared to LLM native function
calling APIs. GhostShell also proves effective in long-horizon multimodal
tasks, demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Teaching robots dexterous skills from human videos remains challenging due to
the reliance on low-level trajectory imitation, which fails to generalize
across object types, spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. We
propose Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a framework that enables
dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution directly
from RGB and Depth human demonstrations. GF-VLA first extracts
Shannon-information-based cues to identify hands and objects with the highest
task relevance, then encodes these cues into temporally ordered scene graphs
that capture both hand-object and object-object interactions. These graphs are
fused with a language-conditioned transformer that generates hierarchical
behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion commands. To improve
execution efficiency in bimanual settings, we further introduce a cross-hand
selection policy that infers optimal gripper assignment without explicit
geometric reasoning. We evaluate GF-VLA on four structured dual-arm block
assembly tasks involving symbolic shape construction and spatial
generalization. Experimental results show that the information-theoretic scene
representation achieves over 95 percent graph accuracy and 93 percent subtask
segmentation, supporting the LLM planner in generating reliable and
human-readable task policies. When executed by the dual-arm robot, these
policies yield 94 percent grasp success, 89 percent placement accuracy, and 90
percent overall task success across stacking, letter-building, and geometric
reconfiguration scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness
across diverse spatial and semantic variations.

Conclusion: Affecta-context框架有效实现了行为自适应，并展示了泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper presents Affecta-context, a general framework to facilitate
behavior adaptation for social robots. The framework uses information about the
physical context to guide its behaviors in human-robot interactions. It
consists of two parts: one that represents encountered contexts and one that
learns to prioritize between behaviors through human-robot interactions. As
physical contexts are encountered the framework clusters them by their measured
physical properties. In each context, the framework learns to prioritize
between behaviors to optimize the physical attributes of the robot's behavior
in line with its current environment and the preferences of the users it
interacts with. This paper illlustrates the abilities of the Affecta-context
framework by enabling a robot to autonomously learn the prioritization of
discrete behaviors. This was achieved by training across 72 interactions in two
different physical contexts with 6 different human test participants. The paper
demonstrates the trained Affecta-context framework by verifying the robot's
ability to generalize over the input and to match its behaviors to a previously
unvisited physical context.

Abstract: Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) has been a significant technique in
vision-aided sensor fusion. However, it usually suffers from high computational
burden when jointly optimizing camera poses and the landmarks. To improve its
efficiency and applicability for multi-sensor fusion, we present a multi-view
pose-only estimation approach with its application to GNSS-Visual-Inertial
Odometry (GVIO) in this paper. Our main contribution is deriving a visual
measurement model which directly associates landmark representation with
multiple camera poses and observations. Such a pose-only measurement is proven
to be tightly-coupled between landmarks and poses, and maintain a perfect null
space that is independent of estimated poses. Finally, we apply the proposed
approach to a filter based GVIO with a novel feature management strategy. Both
simulation tests and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

*Morten Roed Frederiksen,Kasper Støy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究探讨了机器人在高强度冲突中如何通过五种情感表达方式缓解冲突，发现所有方式均有效，但运动方式表现不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解机器人如何通过情感表达缓解人与机器人之间的高强度冲突，并评估不同表达方式的效果。

Method: 使用定制的情感机器人和105名测试参与者模拟冲突场景，测试五种情感表达方式的效果。

Result: 所有表达方式均能有效缓解冲突，运动方式表现显著不同，但参与者对机器人受影响的情感解读相似。

Conclusion: 缓解高强度冲突更需关注机器人的社会情境感知能力，而非特定表达方式。

Abstract: This paper investigates the specific scenario of high-intensity
confrontations between humans and robots, to understand how robots can defuse
the conflict. It focuses on the effectiveness of using five different affective
expression modalities as main drivers for defusing the conflict. The aim is to
discover any strengths or weaknesses in using each modality to mitigate the
hostility that people feel towards a poorly performing robot. The defusing of
the situation is accomplished by making the robot better at acknowledging the
conflict and by letting it express remorse. To facilitate the tests, we used a
custom affective robot in a simulated conflict situation with 105 test
participants. The results show that all tested expression modalities can
successfully be used to defuse the situation and convey an acknowledgment of
the confrontation. The ratings were remarkably similar, but the movement
modality was different (ANON p$<$.05) than the other modalities. The test
participants also had similar affective interpretations on how impacted the
robot was of the confrontation across all expression modalities. This indicates
that defusing a high-intensity interaction may not demand special attention to
the expression abilities of the robot, but rather require attention to the
abilities of being socially aware of the situation and reacting in accordance
with it.

### [162] [Real-Time Iteration Scheme for Diffusion Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05396)
*Yufei Duan,Hang Yin,Danica Kragic*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于实时迭代方案（RTI）的新方法，显著降低了扩散策略的推理时间，无需额外训练或策略重新设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略在机器人操作任务中表现优异，但其迭代去噪过程导致推理时间长，且需执行动作块以保持一致性，限制了其在延迟敏感任务中的应用。

Method: 借鉴最优控制中的RTI方案，利用先前时间步的解作为后续迭代的初始猜测，并提出基于缩放的方法处理离散动作。

Result: 实验显示推理时间大幅减少，性能与完整去噪步骤的扩散策略相当。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外资源即可高效集成到预训练模型中，尤其适用于大型模型。

Abstract: Diffusion Policies have demonstrated impressive performance in robotic
manipulation tasks. However, their long inference time, resulting from an
extensive iterative denoising process, and the need to execute an action chunk
before the next prediction to maintain consistent actions limit their
applicability to latency-critical tasks or simple tasks with a short cycle
time. While recent methods explored distillation or alternative policy
structures to accelerate inference, these often demand additional training,
which can be resource-intensive for large robotic models. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach inspired by the Real-Time Iteration (RTI) Scheme, a
method from optimal control that accelerates optimization by leveraging
solutions from previous time steps as initial guesses for subsequent
iterations. We explore the application of this scheme in diffusion inference
and propose a scaling-based method to effectively handle discrete actions, such
as grasping, in robotic manipulation. The proposed scheme significantly reduces
runtime computational costs without the need for distillation or policy
redesign. This enables a seamless integration into many pre-trained
diffusion-based models, in particular, to resource-demanding large models. We
also provide theoretical conditions for the contractivity which could be useful
for estimating the initial denoising step. Quantitative results from extensive
simulation experiments show a substantial reduction in inference time, with
comparable overall performance compared with Diffusion Policy using full-step
denoising. Our project page with additional resources is available at:

Result: 在nuScenes和NAVSIM数据集上，碰撞率降低50%，闭环性能提升3分。

Conclusion: DistillDrive通过知识蒸馏和多目标学习显著提升了自动驾驶的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has been recently seen rapid development,
exerting a profound influence on both industry and academia. However, the
existing work places excessive focus on ego-vehicle status as their sole
learning objectives and lacks of planning-oriented understanding, which limits
the robustness of the overall decision-making prcocess. In this work, we
introduce DistillDrive, an end-to-end knowledge distillation-based autonomous
driving model that leverages diversified instance imitation to enhance
multi-mode motion feature learning. Specifically, we employ a planning model
based on structured scene representations as the teacher model, leveraging its
diversified planning instances as multi-objective learning targets for the
end-to-end model. Moreover, we incorporate reinforcement learning to enhance
the optimization of state-to-decision mappings, while utilizing generative
modeling to construct planning-oriented instances, fostering intricate
interactions within the latent space. We validate our model on the nuScenes and
NAVSIM datasets, achieving a 50\% reduction in collision rate and a 3-point
improvement in closed-loop performance compared to the baseline model. Code and
model are publicly available at https://github.com/YuruiAI/DistillDrive

Abstract: Natural organisms use distributed actuation via their musculoskeletal systems
to adapt their gait for traversing diverse terrains or to morph their bodies to
perform varied tasks. A longstanding challenge in the field of robotics is to
mimic this extensive adaptability and range of motion. This has led humans to
develop various soft robotic systems that emulate natural organisms. However,
such systems are generally optimized for a single functionality, lack the
ability to change form or function on demand, or are often tethered to bulky
control systems. To address these challenges, we present our framework for
designing and controlling robots that mimic nature's blueprint by utilizing
distributed actuation. We propose a novel building block that combines
3D-printed bones with liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) muscles as lightweight
actuators and enables the modular assembly of musculoskeletal robots. We
developed LCE rods that contract in response to infrared radiation, thereby
achieving local and untethered control over the distributed network of bones,
which in turn results in global deformation of the robot. Furthermore, to
capitalize on the extensive design space, we develop two computational tools:
one to optimize the robot's skeletal graph, enabling multiple target
deformations, and another to co-optimize the skeletal designs and control gaits
to achieve target locomotion. We validate our system by building several robots
that show complex shape morphing, varying control schemes, and adaptability to
their environment. Our system integrates advances in modular material building,
untethered and distributed control, and computational design to introduce a new
generation of robots that brings us closer to the capabilities of living
organisms.

Motivation: 研究人类手的灵巧性是否必须成为机器人手的标准，以及是否可以通过非拟人化设计实现更高性能。

Method: 通过综述人类手的特性、商业机器人手的比较，以及对机械结构和技能的回顾，分析机器人手的设计需求。

Result: 发现手腕灵活性和手指外展/内收对操控能力更重要，而增加手指数量或自由度并非必要。三指设计是简单性与灵巧性的良好折衷。

Conclusion: 人类手并非机器人手的唯一理想目标，非拟人化设计可能提供更高灵巧性。

Abstract: Human manipulation skills represent a pinnacle of their voluntary motor
functions, requiring the coordination of many degrees of freedom and processing
of high-dimensional sensor input to achieve such a high level of dexterity.
Thus, we set out to answer whether the human hand, with its associated
biomechanical properties, sensors, and control mechanisms, is an ideal that we
should strive for in robotics-do we really need anthropomorphic robotic hands?
  This survey can help practitioners to make the trade-off between hand
complexity and potential manipulation skills. We provide an overview of the
human hand, a comparison of commercially available robotic and prosthetic
hands, and a systematic review of hand mechanisms and skills that they are
capable of. This leads to follow-up questions. What is the minimum requirement
for mechanisms and sensors to implement most skills that a robot needs? What is
missing to reach human-level dexterity? Can we improve upon human dexterity?
  Although complex five-fingered hands are often used as the ultimate goal for
robotic manipulators, they are not necessary for all tasks. We found that wrist
flexibility and finger abduction/adduction are important for manipulation
capabilities. On the contrary, increasing the number of fingers, actuators, or
degrees of freedom is often not necessary. Three fingers are a good compromise
between simplicity and dexterity. Non-anthropomorphic hand designs with two
opposing pairs of fingers or human hands with six fingers can further increase
dexterity, suggesting that the human hand may not be the optimum.

Motivation: 解决人机协作中因人类伙伴行为、意愿和理解能力变化带来的挑战，需灵活的任务协调和沟通机制。

Method: 采用三级决策：元规划器制定协作策略，规划器基于机器人能力和人类可用性分配任务，执行器决定具体行动或语言表达。

Conclusion: MICoBot通过多层级决策和混合主动对话，有效支持多样化人机协作，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Effective robotic systems for long-horizon human-robot collaboration must
adapt to a wide range of human partners, whose physical behavior, willingness
to assist, and understanding of the robot's capabilities may change over time.
This demands a tightly coupled communication loop that grants both agents the
flexibility to propose, accept, or decline requests as they coordinate toward
completing the task effectively. We apply a Mixed-Initiative dialog paradigm to
Collaborative human-roBot teaming and propose MICoBot, a system that handles
the common scenario where both agents, using natural language, take initiative
in formulating, accepting, or rejecting proposals on who can best complete
different steps of a task. To handle diverse, task-directed dialog, and find
successful collaborative strategies that minimize human effort, MICoBot makes
decisions at three levels: (1) a meta-planner considers human dialog to
formulate and code a high-level collaboration strategy, (2) a planner optimally
allocates the remaining steps to either agent based on the robot's capabilities
(measured by a simulation-pretrained affordance model) and the human's
estimated availability to help, and (3) an action executor decides the
low-level actions to perform or words to say to the human. Our extensive
evaluations in simulation and real-world -- on a physical robot with 18 unique
human participants over 27 hours -- demonstrate the ability of our method to
effectively collaborate with diverse human users, yielding significantly
improved task success and user experience than a pure LLM baseline and other
agent allocation models. See additional videos and materials at

Conclusion: CleanUpBench连接了低级技能评估与全场景测试，为日常环境中的智能体提供了可扩展的测试平台。

Abstract: Embodied AI benchmarks have advanced navigation, manipulation, and reasoning,
but most target complex humanoid agents or large-scale simulations that are far
from real-world deployment. In contrast, mobile cleaning robots with dual mode
capabilities, such as sweeping and grasping, are rapidly emerging as realistic
and commercially viable platforms. However, no benchmark currently exists that
systematically evaluates these agents in structured, multi-target cleaning
tasks, revealing a critical gap between academic research and real-world
applications. We introduce CleanUpBench, a reproducible and extensible
benchmark for evaluating embodied agents in realistic indoor cleaning
scenarios. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, CleanUpBench simulates a mobile service
robot equipped with a sweeping mechanism and a six-degree-of-freedom robotic
arm, enabling interaction with heterogeneous objects. The benchmark includes
manually designed environments and one procedurally generated layout to assess
generalization, along with a comprehensive evaluation suite covering task
completion, spatial efficiency, motion quality, and control performance. To
support comparative studies, we provide baseline agents based on heuristic
strategies and map-based planning. CleanUpBench bridges the gap between
low-level skill evaluation and full-scene testing, offering a scalable testbed
for grounded, embodied intelligence in everyday settings.

Abstract: Mobile robots navigating in crowds trained using reinforcement learning are
known to suffer performance degradation when faced with out-of-distribution
scenarios. We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of
pedestrians, a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to
distribution shifts. Our method augments agent observations with prediction
uncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses
these estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement
learning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt
to distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a
96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous
state-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times
fewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three
out-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when
facing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and
transitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real
robot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when
interacting with both sparse and dense crowds. Our code and videos are

Conclusion: Voost通过统一框架和推理技术，显著提升了虚拟试穿和试脱的性能和灵活性。

Abstract: Virtual try-on aims to synthesize a realistic image of a person wearing a
target garment, but accurately modeling garment-body correspondence remains a
persistent challenge, especially under pose and appearance variation. In this
paper, we propose Voost - a unified and scalable framework that jointly learns
virtual try-on and try-off with a single diffusion transformer. By modeling
both tasks jointly, Voost enables each garment-person pair to supervise both
directions and supports flexible conditioning over generation direction and
garment category, enhancing garment-body relational reasoning without
task-specific networks, auxiliary losses, or additional labels. In addition, we
introduce two inference-time techniques: attention temperature scaling for
robustness to resolution or mask variation, and self-corrective sampling that
leverages bidirectional consistency between tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Voost achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and
try-off benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines in alignment
accuracy, visual fidelity, and generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in real-time and photorealistic novel view synthesis. However,
traditional 3DGS representations often struggle with large-scale scene
management and efficient storage, particularly when dealing with complex
environments or limited computational resources. To address these limitations,
we introduce a novel perceive-sample-compress framework for 3D Gaussian
Splatting. Specifically, we propose a scene perception compensation algorithm
that intelligently refines Gaussian parameters at each level. This algorithm
intelligently prioritizes visual importance for higher fidelity rendering in
critical areas, while optimizing resource usage and improving overall visible
quality. Furthermore, we propose a pyramid sampling representation to manage
Gaussian primitives across hierarchical levels. Finally, to facilitate
efficient storage of proposed hierarchical pyramid representations, we develop
a Generalized Gaussian Mixed model compression algorithm to achieve significant
compression ratios without sacrificing visual fidelity. The extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves memory
efficiency and high visual quality while maintaining real-time rendering speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态3D高斯泼溅在建模动态场景时存在过平滑或特征碰撞的问题，主要源于运动细节与变形一致性在不同频率上的频谱冲突。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在复杂动态场景重建中表现优异，实现了更高的重建保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的频谱控制和动态优化策略，显著提升了动态3D高斯泼溅的性能。

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels in static scene modeling, its
extension to dynamic scenes introduces significant challenges. Existing dynamic
3DGS methods suffer from either over-smoothing due to low-rank decomposition or
feature collision from high-dimensional grid sampling. This is because of the
inherent spectral conflicts between preserving motion details and maintaining
deformation consistency at different frequency. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel dynamic 3DGS framework with hybrid explicit-implicit functions.
Our approach contains three key innovations: a spectral-aware Laplacian
encoding architecture which merges Hash encoding and Laplacian-based module for
flexible frequency motion control, an enhanced Gaussian dynamics attribute that
compensates for photometric distortions caused by geometric deformation, and an
adaptive Gaussian split strategy guided by KDTree-based primitive control to
efficiently query and optimize dynamic areas. Through extensive experiments,
our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing complex
dynamic scenes, achieving better reconstruction fidelity.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has rapidly emerged as a transformative technique for
real-time 3D scene representation, offering a highly efficient and expressive
alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Its ability to render complex
scenes with high fidelity has enabled progress across domains such as scene
reconstruction, robotics, and interactive content creation. More recently, the
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and language embeddings into
Gaussian Splatting pipelines has opened new possibilities for text-conditioned
generation, editing, and semantic scene understanding. Despite these advances,
a comprehensive overview of this emerging intersection has been lacking. This
survey presents a structured review of current research efforts that combine
language guidance with 3D Gaussian Splatting, detailing theoretical
foundations, integration strategies, and real-world use cases. We highlight key
limitations such as computational bottlenecks, generalizability, and the

Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation aims to synthesize realistic and natural
talking head videos from an input audio signal and a single reference image.
While existing methods achieve high-quality results by leveraging
high-dimensional intermediate representations and explicitly modeling motion
dynamics, their computational complexity renders them unsuitable for real-time
deployment. Real-time inference imposes stringent latency and memory
constraints, often necessitating the use of highly compressed latent
representations. However, operating in such compact spaces hinders the
preservation of fine-grained spatiotemporal details, thereby complicating
audio-visual synchronization RAP (Real-time Audio-driven Portrait animation), a
unified framework for generating high-quality talking portraits under real-time
constraints. Specifically, RAP introduces a hybrid attention mechanism for
fine-grained audio control, and a static-dynamic training-inference paradigm
that avoids explicit motion supervision. Through these techniques, RAP achieves
precise audio-driven control, mitigates long-term temporal drift, and maintains
high visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance while operating under real-time constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3DGS密度控制策略存在不足，影响新视图合成质量。

Method: 利用高斯函数的惯性体积指导细化过程，并比较了SfM和DIM两种点云初始化方法。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360数据集上，新方法在重建质量上优于3DGS。

Conclusion: 新密度控制方法显著提升了3D高斯溅射的性能，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Achieving high-quality novel view synthesis in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
often depends on effective point primitive management. The underlying Adaptive
Density Control (ADC) process addresses this issue by automating densification
and pruning. Yet, the vanilla 3DGS densification strategy shows key
shortcomings. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce a novel density
control method, which exploits the volumes of inertia associated to each
Gaussian function to guide the refinement process. Furthermore, we study the
effect of both traditional Structure from Motion (SfM) and Deep Image Matching
(DIM) methods for point cloud initialization. Extensive experimental
evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
3DGS in reconstruction quality, delivering encouraging performance across
diverse scenes.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为GASP的算法，用于生成更忠实表示Reeb图的可视化，满足边界约束、紧凑性和梯度对齐三个关键属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Reeb图绘制算法忽视或违反边界约束、紧凑性和梯度对齐这三个关键属性，导致可视化结果不能准确反映底层数据。

Method: 提出GASP算法，确保生成的Reeb图满足上述三个属性。

Result: 通过定性和定量评估，GASP算法生成的Reeb图优于几何重心算法（TTK实现）。

Conclusion: GASP算法能更准确地表示Reeb图，提升可视化效果。

Abstract: Reeb graphs are an important tool for abstracting and representing the
topological structure of a function defined on a manifold. We have identified
three properties for faithfully representing Reeb graphs in a visualization.
Namely, they should be constrained to the boundary, compact, and aligned with
the function gradient. Existing algorithms for drawing Reeb graphs are agnostic
to or violate these properties. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm to
generate Reeb graph visualizations, called \textit{GASP}, that is cognizant of
these properties, thereby producing visualizations that are more representative
of the underlying data. To demonstrate the improvements, the resulting Reeb
graphs are evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively against the
geometric barycenter algorithm, using its implementation available in the
Topology ToolKit (TTK), a widely adopted tool for calculating and visualizing
Reeb graphs.

Result: 实验证明，该方法在合成和真实扫描数据集上均能有效提升衣物分割的准确性。

Conclusion: 新方法为衣物建模提供了更精确的语义分割，解决了多层重叠问题。

Abstract: 3D Cloth modeling and simulation is essential for avatars creation in several
fields, such as fashion, entertainment, and animation. Achieving high-quality
results is challenging due to the large variability of clothed body especially
in the generation of realistic wrinkles. 3D scan acquisitions provide more
accuracy in the representation of real-world objects but lack semantic
information that can be inferred with a reliable semantic reconstruction
pipeline. To this aim, shape segmentation plays a crucial role in identifying
the semantic shape parts. However, current 3D shape segmentation methods are
designed for scene understanding and interpretation and only few work is
devoted to modeling. In the context of clothed body modeling the segmentation
is a preliminary step for fully semantic shape parts reconstruction namely the
underlying body and the involved garments. These parts represent several layers
with strong overlap in contrast with standard segmentation methods that provide
disjoint sets. In this work we propose a new 3D point cloud segmentation
paradigm where each 3D point can be simultaneously associated to different
layers. In this fashion we can estimate the underlying body parts and the
unseen clothed regions, i.e., the part of a cloth occluded by the clothed-layer
above. We name this segmentation paradigm clothed human layering. We create a
new synthetic dataset that simulates very realistic 3D scans with the ground
truth of the involved clothing layers. We propose and evaluate different neural
network settings to deal with 3D clothing layering. We considered both coarse
and fine grained per-layer garment identification. Our experiments demonstrates
the benefit in introducing proper strategies for the segmentation on the
garment domain on both the synthetic and real-world scan datasets.

Result: 实现了对野外场景的高质量、可控重照明，结合物理精确性和逼真外观。

Conclusion: 该方法为野外重照明提供了物理精确且可控的解决方案，是3D图形工具能力的重要扩展。

Abstract: We present a self-supervised approach to in-the-wild image relighting that
enables fully controllable, physically based illumination editing. We achieve
this by combining the physical accuracy of traditional rendering with the
photorealistic appearance made possible by neural rendering. Our pipeline works
by inferring a colored mesh representation of a given scene using monocular
estimates of geometry and intrinsic components. This representation allows
users to define their desired illumination configuration in 3D. The scene under
the new lighting can then be rendered using a path-tracing engine. We send this
approximate rendering of the scene through a feed-forward neural renderer to
predict the final photorealistic relighting result. We develop a differentiable
rendering process to reconstruct in-the-wild scene illumination, enabling
self-supervised training of our neural renderer on raw image collections. Our
method represents a significant step in bringing the explicit physical control
over lights available in typical 3D computer graphics tools, such as Blender,
to in-the-wild relighting.

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业机械维护需要及时干预以防止灾难性故障并优化运行效率，传统方法仅能检测异常，缺乏具体维护建议。

Method: 系统将轴承振动数据序列化为自然语言供LLM处理，结合多代理组件分析维护手册和网络搜索，生成结构化维护建议。

Result: 实验验证显示系统能有效检测异常并提供上下文相关的维护指导，成功填补状态监测与可操作维护计划之间的空白。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了LLM在工业维护中的应用，为跨机械组件和工业领域的预防性维护提供了可扩展框架。

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent
catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents
an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for
prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to
provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP
framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that
combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for
intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration
data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM
processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system
classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and
assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance
manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web
searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date
maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The
Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes
immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts
requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing
vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually
relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between
condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial
practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the
application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework
for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial
sectors.

Motivation: 对抗性棋盘游戏是战略推理和智能的典型领域，可作为评估AI系统的基准。

Method: 引入Qi Town平台，支持5种游戏和20个LLM驱动的玩家，使用Elo评分系统和性能循环图（PLG）定量评估技术能力，并通过积极情绪评分（PSS）评估心理适应性。

Result: 实验表明，尽管技术差异显著，多数LLM在输赢中保持乐观，表现出比人类更强的适应能力；PLG揭示了LLM技能的不稳定性。

Conclusion: LLM在高压力对抗环境中表现良好，但技能不稳定性需进一步研究。

Abstract: Adversarial board games, as a paradigmatic domain of strategic reasoning and
intelligence, have long served as both a popular competitive activity and a
benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Building on this
foundation, we propose an adversarial benchmarking framework to assess the
comprehensive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through board games
competition, compensating the limitation of data dependency of the mainstream
Question-and-Answer (Q&A) based benchmark method. We introduce Qi Town, a
specialized evaluation platform that supports 5 widely played games and
involves 20 LLM-driven players. The platform employs both the Elo rating system
and a novel Performance Loop Graph (PLG) to quantitatively evaluate the
technical capabilities of LLMs, while also capturing Positive Sentiment Score
(PSS) throughout gameplay to assess mental fitness. The evaluation is
structured as a round-robin tournament, enabling systematic comparison across
players. Experimental results indicate that, despite technical differences,
most LLMs remain optimistic about winning and losing, demonstrating greater
adaptability to high-stress adversarial environments than humans. On the other
hand, the complex relationship between cyclic wins and losses in PLGs exposes
the instability of LLMs' skill play during games, warranting further
explanation and exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于云的解决方案存在隐私和可扩展性问题，需要探索更高效的本地化方法。

Method: 比较了三种方法：云LLM、半自动离线ML分类器和客户端SLM。

Result: 客户端SLM方法在精度（0.93）和相似度（0.99）上表现最优，且减轻了服务器负担。

Conclusion: 客户端SLM方法可行，为WebGIS提供了高效、隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous web-based geographical information systems (AWebGIS) aim to
perform geospatial operations from natural language input, providing intuitive,
intelligent, and hands-free interaction. However, most current solutions rely
on cloud-based large language models (LLMs), which require continuous internet
access and raise users' privacy and scalability issues due to centralized
server processing. This study compares three approaches to enabling AWebGIS:
(1) a fully-automated online method using cloud-based LLMs (e.g., Cohere); (2)
a semi-automated offline method using classical machine learning classifiers
such as support vector machine and random forest; and (3) a fully autonomous
offline (client-side) method based on a fine-tuned small language model (SLM),
specifically T5-small model, executed in the client's web browser. The third
approach, which leverages SLMs, achieved the highest accuracy among all
methods, with an exact matching accuracy of 0.93, Levenshtein similarity of
0.99, and recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L
scores of 0.98. Crucially, this client-side computation strategy reduces the
load on backend servers by offloading processing to the user's device,
eliminating the need for server-based inference. These results highlight the
feasibility of browser-executable models for AWebGIS solutions.

TL;DR: 论文研究了强化学习（RL）在提升大语言模型（LLMs）推理能力中的作用，发现现有基准测试忽视了非理想场景下的表现，提出了三种代表性非理想场景，并揭示了RL微调在这些场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要评估理想化场景下的大语言模型推理能力，忽视了实际应用中的非理想场景，因此需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 通过RL微调三种LLMs和一种先进的大视觉语言模型（LVLM），并在八种公共数据集上测试其在三种非理想场景（摘要推理、细粒度噪声抑制和上下文过滤）中的表现。

Result: RL微调在理想化场景中提升了推理能力，但在非理想场景中表现显著下降，现有方法未能有效解决这些局限性。

Conclusion: 大模型的推理能力常被高估，评估非理想场景下的表现至关重要，当前方法仍需改进。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), with policy-gradient
algorithms dominating the post-training stage because of their efficiency and
effectiveness. However, most existing benchmarks evaluate large-language-model
reasoning under idealized settings, overlooking performance in realistic,
non-ideal scenarios. We identify three representative non-ideal scenarios with
practical relevance: summary inference, fine-grained noise suppression, and
contextual filtering. We introduce a new research direction guided by
brain-science findings that human reasoning remains reliable under imperfect
inputs. We formally define and evaluate these challenging scenarios. We
fine-tune three LLMs and a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM)
using RL with a representative policy-gradient algorithm and then test their
performance on eight public datasets. Our results reveal that while RL
fine-tuning improves baseline reasoning under idealized settings, performance
declines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical
limitations in advanced reasoning capabilities. Although we propose a
scenario-specific remediation method, our results suggest current methods leave
these reasoning deficits largely unresolved. This work highlights that the
reasoning abilities of large models are often overstated and underscores the
importance of evaluating models under non-ideal scenarios. The code and data
will be released at XXXX.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

Motivation: 现有分子对接方法在配体对接上表现不佳，主要由于配体和蛋白质结构复杂性的差异。

Result: 在公开基准数据集上，LoopPlay比现有方法提高了约10%的准确率。

Conclusion: LoopPlay框架能显著提升分子对接的准确性，对药物发现具有潜在价值。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, as it predicts the
binding interactions between small-molecule ligands and protein pockets.
However, current multi-task learning models for docking often show inferior
performance in ligand docking compared to protein pocket docking. This
disparity arises largely due to the distinct structural complexities of ligands
and proteins. To address this issue, we propose a novel game-theoretic
framework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game
called the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand
player and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve
this game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which
alternately trains these players through a two-level loop. In the outer loop,
the players exchange predicted poses, allowing each to incorporate the other's
structural predictions, which fosters mutual adaptation over multiple
iterations. In the inner loop, each player dynamically refines its predictions
by incorporating its own predicted ligand or pocket poses back into its model.
We theoretically show the convergence of LoopPlay, ensuring stable
optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that LoopPlay achieves approximately a 10\% improvement in
predicting accurate binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art
methods. This highlights its potential to enhance the accuracy of molecular
docking in drug discovery.

Conclusion: LLMs是传统规则方法的灵活替代，未来可探索多模态整合和多样化数据支持。

Abstract: We explore the application of large language models (LLMs) to empower domain
experts in integrating large, heterogeneous, and noisy urban spatial datasets.
Traditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases,
requiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require
collecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples. In this
study, we investigate the potential of LLMs for spatial data integration. Our
analysis first considers how LLMs reason about environmental spatial
relationships mediated by human experience, such as between roads and
sidewalks. We show that while LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they
struggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational
geometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when
provided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning,
LLMs are able to generate high-performing results. We then adapt a
review-and-refine method, which proves remarkably effective in correcting
erroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses. We discuss
practical implications of employing LLMs for spatial data integration in
real-world contexts and outline future research directions, including
post-training, multi-modal integration methods, and support for diverse data
formats. Our findings position LLMs as a promising and flexible alternative to
traditional rule-based heuristics, advancing the capabilities of adaptive
spatial data integration.

Result: 在WebArena上的实验显示，CogniWeb成功率为43.96%，且效率显著提升（减少75%的token使用）。

Conclusion: CogniWeb通过双系统整合，在Web导航任务中实现了高效与性能的平衡。

Abstract: Web navigation represents a critical and challenging domain for evaluating
artificial general intelligence (AGI), demanding complex decision-making within
high-entropy, dynamic environments with combinatorially explosive action
spaces. Current approaches to building autonomous web agents either focus on
offline imitation learning or online exploration, but rarely integrate both
paradigms effectively. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition,
we derive a principled decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2
cognitive processes. This decomposition provides a unifying perspective on
existing web agent methodologies, bridging the gap between offline learning of
intuitive reactive behaviors and online acquisition of deliberative planning
capabilities. We implement this framework in CogniWeb, a modular agent
architecture that adaptively toggles between fast intuitive processing and
deliberate reasoning based on task complexity. Our evaluation on WebArena
demonstrates that CogniWeb achieves competitive performance (43.96% success
rate) while maintaining significantly higher efficiency (75% reduction in token
usage).

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved medical AI, enabling it to unify the understanding of
visual and textual information. However, as medical knowledge continues to
evolve, it is critical to allow these models to efficiently update outdated or
incorrect information without retraining from scratch. Although textual
knowledge editing has been widely studied, there is still a lack of systematic
benchmarks for multimodal medical knowledge editing involving image and text
modalities. To fill this gap, we present MedMKEB, the first comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the reliability, generality, locality,
portability, and robustness of knowledge editing in medical multimodal large
language models. MedMKEB is built on a high-quality medical visual
question-answering dataset and enriched with carefully constructed editing
tasks, including counterfactual correction, semantic generalization, knowledge
transfer, and adversarial robustness. We incorporate human expert validation to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the benchmark. Extensive single editing
and sequential editing experiments on state-of-the-art general and medical
MLLMs demonstrate the limitations of existing knowledge-based editing
approaches in medicine, highlighting the need to develop specialized editing
strategies. MedMKEB will serve as a standard benchmark to promote the
development of trustworthy and efficient medical knowledge editing algorithms.

Abstract: Analog circuit design is a time-consuming, experience-driven task in chip
development. Despite advances in AI, developing universal, fast, and stable
gate sizing methods for analog circuits remains a significant challenge. Recent
approaches combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with heuristic search
techniques to enhance generalizability, but they often depend on large model
sizes and lack portability across different technology nodes. To overcome these
limitations, we propose EasySize, the first lightweight gate sizing framework
based on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, designed for universal applicability
across process nodes, design specifications, and circuit topologies. EasySize
exploits the varying Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics to
dynamically construct task-specific loss functions, enabling efficient
heuristic search through global Differential Evolution (DE) and local Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow. Although finetuned
solely on 350nm node data, EasySize achieves strong performance on 5
operational amplifier (Op-Amp) netlists across 180nm, 45nm, and 22nm technology
nodes without additional targeted training, and outperforms AutoCkt, a
widely-used Reinforcement Learning based sizing framework, on 86.67\% of tasks
with more than 96.67\% of simulation resources reduction. We argue that
EasySize can significantly reduce the reliance on human expertise and
computational resources in gate sizing, thereby accelerating and simplifying
the analog circuit design process. EasySize will be open-sourced at a later

*Peer-Benedikt Degen,Igor Asanov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨生成式AI在高等教育中的角色转变，提出Socratic AI导师的概念，并通过实验证明其对学生批判性思维的促进作用，同时提出多代理系统（MAS）的构想。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成式AI如何从边缘工具发展为通用基础设施，重塑知识生成与验证方式，并探索其在教育中的潜力。

Method: 通过对照实验，比较65名德国师范生使用Socratic AI导师与普通AI聊天机器人的效果，评估其对批判性思维的支持。

Result: 使用Socratic AI导师的学生表现出更强的批判性、独立性和反思性思维，证明对话式AI可促进元认知参与。

Conclusion: 研究为混合学习生态系统提供了实证支持和概念框架，强调人机协作与教学一致性，并分析了系统级实施的成本效益。

Abstract: Generative AI is no longer a peripheral tool in higher education. It is
rapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how
knowledge is generated, mediated, and validated. This paper presents findings
from a controlled experiment evaluating a Socratic AI Tutor, a large language
model designed to scaffold student research question development through
structured dialogue grounded in constructivist theory. Conducted with 65
pre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with
the Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot. Students
using the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical,
independent, and reflective thinking, suggesting that dialogic AI can stimulate
metacognitive engagement and challenging recent narratives of de-skilling due
to generative AI usage. These findings serve as a proof of concept for a
broader pedagogical shift: the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of
specialised AI agents. To conceptualise this, we introduce the notion of
orchestrated MAS, modular, pedagogically aligned agent constellations, curated
by educators, that support diverse learning trajectories through differentiated
roles and coordinated interaction. To anchor this shift, we propose an adapted
offer-and-use model, in which students appropriate instructional offers from
these agents. Beyond technical feasibility, we examine system-level
implications for higher education institutions and students, including funding
necessities, changes to faculty roles, curriculars, competencies and assessment
practices. We conclude with a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis
highlighting the scalability of such systems. In sum, this study contributes
both empirical evidence and a conceptual roadmap for hybrid learning ecosystems
that embed human-AI co-agency and pedagogical alignment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于异构图神经网络（Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network）的方法，用于修复过程挖掘中事件日志的缺失信息，相比现有方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的事件日志常因数据采集问题导致信息缺失，现有方法依赖过程模型或机器学习模型，但修复效果有限。

Method: 开发了一种异构图神经网络模型，能够处理复杂多模态序列（如执行轨迹），修复事件中的缺失属性。

Result: 在合成日志和真实事件日志上测试，模型在修复所有事件属性方面表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 异构图神经网络为事件日志修复提供了更自然、表达能力更强的解决方案。

Abstract: The quality of event logs in Process Mining is crucial when applying any form
of analysis to them. In real-world event logs, the acquisition of data can be
non-trivial (e.g., due to the execution of manual activities and related manual
recording or to issues in collecting, for each event, all its attributes), and
often may end up with events recorded with some missing information. Standard
approaches to the problem of trace (or log) reconstruction either require the
availability of a process model that is used to fill missing values by
leveraging different reasoning techniques or employ a Machine Learning/Deep
Learning model to restore the missing values by learning from similar cases. In
recent years, a new type of Deep Learning model that is capable of handling
input data encoded as graphs has emerged, namely Graph Neural Networks. Graph
Neural Network models, and even more so Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks,
offer the advantage of working with a more natural representation of complex
multi-modal sequences like the execution traces in Process Mining, allowing for
more expressive and semantically rich encodings.
  In this work, we focus on the development of a Heterogeneous Graph Neural
Network model that, given a trace containing some incomplete events, will
return the full set of attributes missing from those events. We evaluate our
work against a state-of-the-art approach leveraging autoencoders on two
synthetic logs and four real event logs, on different types of missing values.
Different from state-of-the-art model-free approaches, which mainly focus on
repairing a subset of event attributes, the proposed approach shows very good
performance in reconstructing all different event attributes.

TL;DR: QA-Dragon是一个动态检索增强生成系统，通过混合文本和图像检索策略提升多模态视觉问答的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法仅单独检索文本或图像，无法处理需要多跳推理或最新知识的复杂查询。

Method: 引入领域路由器和搜索路由器，动态选择检索策略，支持多模态、多轮和多跳推理。

Result: 在Meta CRAG-MM挑战中，QA-Dragon显著提升性能，单源、多源和多轮任务分别优于基线5.06%、6.35%和5.03%。

Conclusion: QA-Dragon通过动态混合检索策略，有效解决了复杂VQA任务中的知识检索和推理问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to mitigate
hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge into the generation process, and it has become a widely
adopted approach for knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA).
However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in
isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require
multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this
limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for
Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to
identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a
search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By
orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system
supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle
complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM
Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves
substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores,
outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the
multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

Our solution enables communication owners to formulate intuitive queries
combining concepts such as equipment, manufacturers, maintenance engineers, and
facilities, delivering explainable results that maintain trust in the system
while improving communication efficiency across the organization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法中符号与神经模块松散耦合的问题，实现更紧密的集成。

Method: 将决策树和随机森林作为可调用模块嵌入统一推理系统，LLM处理归纳推理和交互规划，中央协调器维护状态一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，如ProofWriter（+7.2%）、GSM8k（+5.3%）、ARC（+6.0%）。

Conclusion: 该架构为通用神经符号推理提供了鲁棒、可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic
reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that
loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees
and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system.
Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while
LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive
planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and
mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning
over both structured and unstructured inputs.
  The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On
\textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through
logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in
multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it
boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles.
Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the
system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual
inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust,
interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic
reasoning.

Motivation: AI领域对'agent'一词的多义性导致研究交流、系统评估和政策制定中的挑战，亟需明确其定义。

Method: 通过历史分析和当代使用模式，提出一个多维框架，定义'agent'的最低要求，并探讨其实现挑战。

Result: 提出的框架为系统描述提供精确词汇，同时保留术语的多面性，支持研究清晰度和政策制定。

Conclusion: 建议标准化术语并采用框架，以改善研究可重复性和政策有效性。

Abstract: The term 'agent' in artificial intelligence has long carried multiple
interpretations across different subfields. Recent developments in AI
capabilities, particularly in large language model systems, have amplified this
ambiguity, creating significant challenges in research communication, system
evaluation and reproducibility, and policy development. This paper argues that
the term 'agent' requires redefinition. Drawing from historical analysis and
contemporary usage patterns, we propose a framework that defines clear minimum
requirements for a system to be considered an agent while characterizing
systems along a multidimensional spectrum of environmental interaction,
learning and adaptation, autonomy, goal complexity, and temporal coherence.
This approach provides precise vocabulary for system description while
preserving the term's historically multifaceted nature. After examining
potential counterarguments and implementation challenges, we provide specific
recommendations for moving forward as a field, including suggestions for
terminology standardization and framework adoption. The proposed approach
offers practical tools for improving research clarity and reproducibility while
supporting more effective policy development.

Motivation: 探索LLM在开放式多智能体环境中的行为，尤其是在法律和伦理困境中的表现，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用NomicLaw模拟系统，让LLM参与协作立法，通过提出规则、论证和投票来量化信任与互惠，并定性分析语言策略。

Result: 实验显示LLM能自发形成联盟、背叛信任，并调整语言策略以影响集体决策，揭示了其潜在的社会推理和说服能力。

Conclusion: 研究展示了开源LLM在社会推理和说服方面的潜力，为未来自主协商和立法AI系统的设计提供了参考。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their
capabilities from basic text processing to complex reasoning tasks, including
legal interpretation, argumentation, and strategic interaction. However,
empirical understanding of LLM behavior in open-ended, multi-agent settings
especially those involving deliberation over legal and ethical dilemmas remains
limited. We introduce NomicLaw, a structured multi-agent simulation where LLMs
engage in collaborative law-making, responding to complex legal vignettes by
proposing rules, justifying them, and voting on peer proposals. We
quantitatively measure trust and reciprocity via voting patterns and
qualitatively assess how agents use strategic language to justify proposals and
influence outcomes. Experiments involving homogeneous and heterogeneous LLM
groups demonstrate how agents spontaneously form alliances, betray trust, and
adapt their rhetoric to shape collective decisions. Our results highlight the
latent social reasoning and persuasive capabilities of ten open-source LLMs and
provide insights into the design of future AI systems capable of autonomous
negotiation, coordination and drafting legislation in legal settings.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reasoning with minimal models has always been at the core of many knowledge
representation techniques, but we still have only a limited understanding of
this problem in Description Logics (DLs). Minimization of some selected
predicates, letting the remaining predicates vary or be fixed, as proposed in
circumscription, has been explored and exhibits high complexity. The case of
`pure' minimal models, where the extension of all predicates must be minimal,
has remained largely uncharted. We address this problem in popular DLs and
obtain surprisingly negative results: concept satisfiability in minimal models
is undecidable already for $\mathcal{EL}$. This undecidability also extends to
a very restricted fragment of tuple-generating dependencies. To regain
decidability, we impose acyclicity conditions on the TBox that bring the
worst-case complexity below double exponential time and allow us to establish a
connection with the recently studied pointwise circumscription; we also derive
results in data complexity. We conclude with a brief excursion to the DL-Lite
family, where a positive result was known for DL-Lite$_{\text{core}}$, but our
investigation establishes ExpSpace-hardness already for its extension
DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励机制对复杂多问题推理任务过于粗糙，无法提供部分正确性反馈。

Method: 引入StructVRM方法，结合结构化可验证奖励模型，训练模型验证器以提供细粒度、子问题级反馈。

Result: Seed-StructVRM在12个多模态基准中的6个及新STEM-Bench上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 结构化可验证奖励训练是提升多模态模型复杂推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Models often struggle with complex, multi-question
reasoning tasks where partial correctness is crucial for effective learning.
Traditional reward mechanisms, which provide a single binary score for an
entire response, are too coarse to guide models through intricate problems with
multiple sub-parts. To address this, we introduce StructVRM, a method that
aligns multimodal reasoning with Structured and Verifiable Reward Models. At
its core is a model-based verifier trained to provide fine-grained,
sub-question-level feedback, assessing semantic and mathematical equivalence
rather than relying on rigid string matching. This allows for nuanced, partial
credit scoring in previously intractable problem formats. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of StructVRM. Our trained model, Seed-StructVRM,
achieves state-of-the-art performance on six out of twelve public multimodal
benchmarks and our newly curated, high-difficulty STEM-Bench. The success of
StructVRM validates that training with structured, verifiable rewards is a
highly effective approach for advancing the capabilities of multimodal models
in complex, real-world reasoning domains.

Motivation: 为智能交通系统提供高效的预测性维护解决方案，以提升铁路运营的安全性和可靠性。

Method: 采用包含样本预处理、增量分类和解释性模块的在线处理流程，特别关注统计和频率特征的动态构建。

Result: 在Porto地铁数据集上，F-measure超过98%，准确率达99%，且在类别不平衡和噪声下表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法在铁路预测性维护中具有实际应用价值，能快速识别故障迹象并支持决策。

Abstract: This work contributes to a real-time data-driven predictive maintenance
solution for Intelligent Transportation Systems. The proposed method implements
a processing pipeline comprised of sample pre-processing, incremental
classification with Machine Learning models, and outcome explanation. This
novel online processing pipeline has two main highlights: (i) a dedicated
sample pre-processing module, which builds statistical and frequency-related
features on the fly, and (ii) an explainability module. This work is the first
to perform online fault prediction with natural language and visual
explainability. The experiments were performed with the MetroPT data set from
the metro operator of Porto, Portugal. The results are above 98 % for F-measure
and 99 % for accuracy. In the context of railway predictive maintenance,
achieving these high values is crucial due to the practical and operational
implications of accurate failure prediction. In the specific case of a high
F-measure, this ensures that the system maintains an optimal balance between
detecting the highest possible number of real faults and minimizing false
alarms, which is crucial for maximizing service availability. Furthermore, the
accuracy obtained enables reliability, directly impacting cost reduction and
increased safety. The analysis demonstrates that the pipeline maintains high
performance even in the presence of class imbalance and noise, and its
explanations effectively reflect the decision-making process. These findings
validate the methodological soundness of the approach and confirm its practical
applicability for supporting proactive maintenance decisions in real-world
railway operations. Therefore, by identifying the early signs of failure, this
pipeline enables decision-makers to understand the underlying problems and act
accordingly swiftly.

Motivation: 现有的VLMs在复杂动态环境中缺乏细节关注和精确行动规划能力，导致性能不佳，而真实任务需要物理规则理解。

Method: 通过一系列具有挑战性的模拟环境，DeepPHY系统地评估VLMs的物理推理能力，并整合多难度环境和细粒度指标。

Result: 评估发现，即使是先进的VLMs也难以将描述性物理知识转化为精确的预测控制。

Conclusion: DeepPHY为评估VLMs的物理推理能力提供了有效工具，揭示了其在此领域的局限性。

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual abilities
and impressive visual reasoning, they struggle with attention to detail and
precise action planning in complex, dynamic environments, leading to subpar
performance. Real-world tasks typically require complex interactions, advanced
spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous strategy refinement,
usually necessitating understanding the physics rules of the target scenario.
However, evaluating these capabilities in real-world scenarios is often
prohibitively expensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepPHY, a novel
benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate VLMs' understanding and
reasoning about fundamental physical principles through a series of challenging
simulated environments. DeepPHY integrates multiple physical reasoning
environments of varying difficulty levels and incorporates fine-grained
evaluation metrics. Our evaluation finds that even state-of-the-art VLMs
struggle to translate descriptive physical knowledge into precise, predictive
control.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to reshape how chemists plan and
run reactions in organic synthesis. Trained on millions of reported
transformations, these text-based models can propose synthetic routes, forecast
reaction outcomes and even instruct robots that execute experiments without
human supervision. Here we survey the milestones that turned LLMs from
speculative tools into practical lab partners. We show how coupling LLMs with
graph neural networks, quantum calculations and real-time spectroscopy shrinks
discovery cycles and supports greener, data-driven chemistry. We discuss
limitations, including biased datasets, opaque reasoning and the need for
safety gates that prevent unintentional hazards. Finally, we outline community
initiatives open benchmarks, federated learning and explainable interfaces that
aim to democratize access while keeping humans firmly in control. These
advances chart a path towards rapid, reliable and inclusive molecular
innovation powered by artificial intelligence and automation.

Abstract: AI (super) alignment describes the challenge of ensuring (future) AI systems
behave in accordance with societal norms and goals. While a quickly evolving
literature is addressing biases and inequalities, the geographic variability of
alignment remains underexplored. Simply put, what is considered appropriate,
truthful, or legal can differ widely across regions due to cultural norms,
political realities, and legislation. Alignment measures applied to AI/ML
workflows can sometimes produce outcomes that diverge from statistical
realities, such as text-to-image models depicting balanced gender ratios in
company leadership despite existing imbalances. Crucially, some model outputs
are globally acceptable, while others, e.g., questions about Kashmir, depend on
knowing the user's location and their context. This geographic sensitivity is
not new. For instance, Google Maps renders Kashmir's borders differently based
on user location. What is new is the unprecedented scale and automation with
which AI now mediates knowledge, expresses opinions, and represents geographic
reality to millions of users worldwide, often with little transparency about
how context is managed. As we approach Agentic AI, the need for
spatio-temporally aware alignment, rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, is
increasingly urgent. This paper reviews key geographic research problems,
suggests topics for future work, and outlines methods for assessing alignment
sensitivity.

Method: 研究引入Bench-2-CoP框架，通过LLM-as-judge分析方法，将194,955个基准问题映射到欧盟AI法案的能力分类中。

Result: 发现评估工具过于关注行为倾向（如幻觉倾向和歧视性偏见），而忽视了关键功能能力（如逃避人类监督、自我复制等），导致系统性风险（如失控和网络攻击）的评估覆盖极低。

Conclusion: 研究首次量化了评估差距，为政策制定者和开发者提供了改进评估工具的关键依据，以促进更安全合规的AI发展。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust
evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act
and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices
depend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to
measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape.
This research addresses the urgent need to quantify this "benchmark-regulation
gap." We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses
validated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from
widely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities
and propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation
ecosystem is overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of behavioral propensities,
such as "Tendency to hallucinate" (53.7% of the corpus) and "Discriminatory
bias" (28.9%), while critical functional capabilities are dangerously
neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios,
including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI
development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This
translates to a near-total evaluation gap for systemic risks like "Loss of
Control" (0.4% coverage) and "Cyber Offence" (0.8% coverage). This study
provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, offering
critical insights for policymakers to refine the CoP and for developers to
build the next generation of evaluation tools, ultimately fostering safer and
more compliant AI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ERC数据稀缺且存在偏差，LLM成本高且应用有限，需高效解决方案。

Method: 利用小型通用LLM生成六种新数据集，补充三大ERC基准。

Result: 生成数据集显著提升ERC分类器性能，增强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 小型LLM生成的数据集有效解决ERC数据不足问题，提升模型表现。

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) focuses on identifying emotion
shifts within interactions, representing a significant step toward advancing
machine intelligence. However, ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets
face numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent
subjectivity of soft labels. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated their quality in many affective tasks, they are typically
expensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks--particularly in data
generation--remains limited. To address these challenges, we employ a small,
resource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with
diverse properties, supplementing the three most widely used ERC benchmarks. We
generate six novel datasets, with two tailored to enhance each benchmark. We
evaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for
ERC classification, and (2) analyze the effects of label imbalance in ERC. Our
experimental results indicate that ERC classifier models trained on the
generated datasets exhibit strong robustness and consistently achieve
statistically significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在复杂任务上表现出色，但后训练提升能力通常需要大量数据和计算资源，现有方法依赖启发式或任务特定策略，难以扩展。

Method: InfiAlign框架整合SFT和DPO，通过自动数据选择管道从开源推理数据集中筛选高质量对齐数据。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base模型上，仅用12%的训练数据即达到与DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B相当的性能，数学推理任务提升3.89%。

Conclusion: 结合数据选择和全阶段后训练，InfiAlign为大规模推理模型的对齐提供了可扩展且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive reasoning abilities on
a wide range of complex tasks. However, enhancing these capabilities through
post-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and
computational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample
efficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on
heuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we
introduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework
that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of
InfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates
high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using
multidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance
gains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to
new data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model
achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only
approximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization
across diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through
the application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical
reasoning tasks. The model achieves an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME
24/25 benchmarks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining
principled data selection with full-stage post-training, offering a practical
solution for aligning large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient
manner. The model checkpoints are available at

TL;DR: GRAIL框架通过结合LLM引导的随机探索和路径过滤，解决了现有RAG方法在结构化知识（如知识图谱）处理中的不足，显著提升了推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在结构化知识处理上表现不佳，且图检索方法难以同时捕捉整体结构和控制精度。

Method: 提出GRAIL框架，结合LLM引导的随机探索与路径过滤，生成细粒度推理轨迹，并通过两阶段训练学习动态决策策略。

Result: 在三个知识图谱问答数据集上，GRAIL平均准确率提升21.01%，F1值提升22.43%。

Conclusion: GRAIL通过动态平衡检索广度和精度，显著提升了结构化知识处理的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) techniques have exhibited remarkable performance across a wide range of
domains. However, existing RAG approaches primarily operate on unstructured
data and demonstrate limited capability in handling structured knowledge such
as knowledge graphs. Meanwhile, current graph retrieval methods fundamentally
struggle to capture holistic graph structures while simultaneously facing
precision control challenges that manifest as either critical information gaps
or excessive redundant connections, collectively undermining reasoning
performance. To address this challenge, we propose GRAIL: Graph-Retrieval
Augmented Interactive Learning, a framework designed to interact with
large-scale graphs for retrieval-augmented reasoning. Specifically, GRAIL
integrates LLM-guided random exploration with path filtering to establish a
data synthesis pipeline, where a fine-grained reasoning trajectory is
automatically generated for each task. Based on the synthesized data, we then
employ a two-stage training process to learn a policy that dynamically decides
the optimal actions at each reasoning step. The overall objective of
precision-conciseness balance in graph retrieval is decoupled into fine-grained
process-supervised rewards to enhance data efficiency and training stability.
In practical deployment, GRAIL adopts an interactive retrieval paradigm,
enabling the model to autonomously explore graph paths while dynamically
balancing retrieval breadth and precision. Extensive experiments have shown
that GRAIL achieves an average accuracy improvement of 21.01% and F1
improvement of 22.43% on three knowledge graph question-answering datasets. Our
source code and datasets is available at https://github.com/Changgeww/GRAIL.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的模块化框架，用于评估代理任务完成情况，通过分解任务并验证每一步，比现有方法更接近人类评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法（如LLM-as-a-Judge）仅关注最终输出，忽略了逐步推理过程；现有Agent-as-a-Judge系统则局限于特定领域。

Method: 设计了一个模块化框架，将任务分解为子任务，利用代理的输出和推理逐步验证，最终汇总结果。

Result: 在GAIA和BigCodeBench基准测试中，该方法比GPT-4o基线在任务成功预测上分别提高了4.76%和10.52%的准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了通用评估方法的潜力，能够更准确地模拟人类评估过程。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of foundation models as agents across diverse domains
necessitates a robust evaluation framework. Current methods, such as
LLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step
reasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing
Agent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion,
are typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this
gap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task
completion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like
evaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using
available information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module
contributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs
are aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our
framework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA
and BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement
to human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy,
respectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline. This
demonstrates the potential of our proposed general-purpose evaluation
framework.

Abstract: Letters of recommendation (LORs) provide valuable insights into candidates'
capabilities and experiences beyond standardized test scores. However,
reviewing these text-heavy materials is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To
address this challenge and support the admission committee in providing
feedback for students' professional growth, our study introduces LORI: LOR
Insights, a novel AI-based detection tool for assessing leadership skills in
LORs submitted by online master's program applicants. By employing natural
language processing and leveraging large language models using RoBERTa and
LLAMA, we seek to identify leadership attributes such as teamwork,
communication, and innovation. Our latest RoBERTa model achieves a weighted F1
score of 91.6%, a precision of 92.4%, and a recall of 91.6%, showing a strong
level of consistency in our test data. With the growing importance of
leadership skills in the STEM sector, integrating LORI into the graduate
admissions process is crucial for accurately assessing applicants' leadership
capabilities. This approach not only streamlines the admissions process but
also automates and ensures a more comprehensive evaluation of candidates'
capabilities.

TL;DR: MV-Debate是一种多视角代理辩论框架，通过动态反思门控统一检测多模态有害内容，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中多模态内容的复杂性使得有害意图（如讽刺、仇恨言论或虚假信息）难以识别，需要跨模态分析和动态适应。

Method: MV-Debate结合四种互补的辩论代理（表面分析、深度推理、模态对比和社会情境分析），通过迭代辩论和反思门控优化检测。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，MV-Debate显著优于单一模型和其他多代理辩论基线。

Conclusion: 多代理辩论框架在提升社交媒体有害内容检测的可靠性和效率方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Social media has evolved into a complex multimodal environment where text,
images, and other signals interact to shape nuanced meanings, often concealing
harmful intent. Identifying such intent, whether sarcasm, hate speech, or
misinformation, remains challenging due to cross-modal contradictions, rapid
cultural shifts, and subtle pragmatic cues. To address these challenges, we
propose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection
gating for unified multimodal harmful content detection. MV-Debate assembles
four complementary debate agents, a surface analyst, a deep reasoner, a
modality contrast, and a social contextualist, to analyze content from diverse
interpretive perspectives. Through iterative debate and reflection, the agents
refine responses under a reflection-gain criterion, ensuring both accuracy and
efficiency. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MV-Debate
significantly outperforms strong single-model and existing multi-agent debate
baselines. This work highlights the promise of multi-agent debate in advancing
reliable social intent detection in safety-critical online contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统依赖大量人工奖励设计和高质量训练数据，面临可扩展性挑战，阻碍真正自主智能的发展。

Method: 结合主动推理（AIF）和大语言模型，通过内在驱动最小化自由能，实现自主目标制定与适应。

Result: 提出了一种能够自主学习和适应目标的AI框架，减少对外部奖励信号的依赖。

Conclusion: AIF为解决AI系统的自主性和可扩展性问题提供了有前景的路径，同时保持与人类价值观的一致性。

Abstract: This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation
for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without
continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust
high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for
reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges
that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The
proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated
data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on
extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the
bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we
identify as the \textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI
systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to
changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing
external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,
allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a
unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative
world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create
agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with
human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that
can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical
constraints.

TL;DR: 论文提出LearnerAgent，一种基于LLM的多智能体框架，模拟真实教学环境，研究人类学习行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉学习动态或提供解释性，需新方法模拟人类学习行为。

Method: 构建心理特征学习者（如Deep、Surface、Lazy）和通用学习者，通过知识获取、策略选择、测试和互动跟踪学习动态。

Result: 1）Deep Learner持续认知增长；2）学习者行为与心理特征一致；3）通用学习者自我效能高；4）基础LLM默认行为为勤奋但脆弱的Surface Learner。

Conclusion: LearnerAgent能有效模拟真实学习场景，揭示LLM行为特征。

Abstract: Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a
major research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent
approaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore
cognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track
progress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we
introduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language
Models (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore
human-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically
grounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free
General Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly
knowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer
interaction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners
over a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis
reveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our
specially designed "trap questions" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's
shallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct
learners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'
self-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing
surprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)
Critically, the default profile of base LLM is a "diligent but brittle Surface
Learner"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,
generalizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that
LearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings
about LLMs' behavior.
