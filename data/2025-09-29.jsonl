Recent research suggested that\nlegged robots with direct-drive and low-gear ratio actuators can sensitively\ndetect external forces, and therefore possess the potential to measure terrain\nproperties with their legs during locomotion, providing unprecedented sampling\nspeed and density while accessing terrains previously too risky to sample. This\npaper explores these ideas by investigating the impact of gait on\nproprioceptive terrain sensing accuracy, particularly comparing a\nsensing-oriented gait, Crawl N' Sense, with a locomotion-oriented gait,\nTrot-Walk. Each gait's ability to measure the strength and texture of\ndeformable substrate is quantified as the robot locomotes over a laboratory\ntransect consisting of a rigid surface, loose sand, and loose sand with\nsynthetic surface crusts.

Effective operation involves not\nonly physical interaction but also the ability to interpret dynamic\nenvironments, understand tasks, and choose appropriate actions based on\ncontext. This requires integrating both hardware components (e.g. sensors,\nactuators) and software systems capable of reasoning about tasks, environments,\nand robot capabilities. Frameworks such as the Robot Operating System (ROS)\nprovide open-source tools that help connect low-level hardware with\nhigher-level functionalities. However, real-world deployments remain tightly\ncoupled to specific platforms. As a result, solutions are often isolated and\nhard-coded, limiting interoperability, reusability, and knowledge sharing.\nOntologies and knowledge graphs offer a structured way to represent tasks,\nenvironments, and robot capabilities. Existing ontologies, such as the\nSocio-physical Model of Activities (SOMA) and the Descriptive Ontology for\nLinguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE), provide models for activities,\nspatial relationships, and reasoning structures. However, they often focus on\nspecific domains and do not fully capture the connection between environment,\naction, robot capabilities, and system-level integration. In this work, we\npropose the Ontology for roBOts and acTions (OntoBOT), which extends existing\nontologies to provide a unified representation of tasks, actions, environments,\nand capabilities. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we unify these aspects\ninto a cohesive ontology to support formal reasoning about task execution, and\n(2) we demonstrate its generalizability by evaluating competency questions\nacross four embodied agents - TIAGo, HSR, UR3, and Stretch - showing how\nOntoBOT enables context-aware reasoning, task-oriented execution, and knowledge\nsharing in service robotics."}

Underwater operations remain difficult due to\nhydrodynamic disturbances, limited communication bandwidth, and degraded\nsensing in turbid waters. To address these challenges, we introduce three\ninnovations. First, a dual-brain architecture decouples high-level mission\nreasoning from low-level reactive control, enabling robust operation under\ncommunication and computational constraints. Second, we apply\nVision-Language-Action(VLA) models to underwater robotics for the first time,\nincorporating structured chain-of-thought reasoning for interpretable\ndecision-making. Third, a hydrodynamics-informed Model Predictive Control(MPC)\nscheme compensates for fluid effects in real time without costly task-specific\ntraining.

To test this\nhypothesis, we present WoW, a 14-billion-parameter generative world model\ntrained on 2 million robot interaction trajectories. Our findings reveal that\nthe model's understanding of physics is a probabilistic distribution of\nplausible outcomes, leading to stochastic instabilities and physical\nhallucinations.
