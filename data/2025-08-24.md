### [1] [Image-Conditioned 3D Gaussian Splat Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15372)
*Xinshuang Liu,Runfa Blark Li,Keito Suzuki,Truong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ICGS-Quantizer方法，通过联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性，使用跨场景共享码本，将3D高斯泼溅压缩到千字节级别，并支持基于图像的场景更新


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS压缩方法只能压缩到兆字节级别，不适用于大规模场景或场景集合的长期归档，且缺乏对归档后场景变化的适应机制

Method: 使用图像条件化的高斯泼溅量化器，联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性，采用跨训练场景共享的固定码本，编码、量化和解码过程联合训练，支持基于解码时图像的场景重建

Result: 将3DGS存储需求降低到千字节范围，在压缩效率和场景变化适应性方面均优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: ICGS-Quantizer显著提升了3D高斯泼溅的压缩效率，实现了千字节级别的压缩，同时提供了对归档后场景变化的适应能力，为大规模3D场景的长期存储和更新提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

### [2] [Heatmap Regression without Soft-Argmax for Facial Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14929)
*Chiao-An Yang,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了人脸关键点检测中广泛使用的Soft-argmax方法，提出了一种基于结构化预测框架的替代训练目标，在三个基准数据集上实现了SOTA性能，训练收敛速度提升2.2倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于热图回归的人脸关键点检测方法普遍使用Soft-argmax作为argmax的可微分近似，但作者认为这不是实现高性能的唯一途径，希望探索更有效的替代方案。

Method: 提出基于经典结构化预测框架的训练目标，替代传统的Soft-argmax方法，实现了端到端的可微分训练。

Result: 在WFLW、COFW和300W三个人脸关键点基准数据集上达到了最先进的性能，训练收敛速度比传统方法快2.2倍，同时保持更好或相当的精度。

Conclusion: Soft-argmax并非人脸关键点检测中实现高性能的唯一选择，基于结构化预测的替代方法能够提供更快的收敛速度和竞争性的精度表现。

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available
here: https://github.com/ca-joe-yang/regression-without-softarg.

### [3] [Fast Graph Neural Network for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14958)
*Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过结合图卷积神经网络和Voronoi图的新方法，将图像表示为图形结构，使用Delaunay三角剖优化表征，在多个标准数据集上实现了预处理效率和分类准确性的显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图卷积神经网络能够有效处理复杂数据结构，但传统卷积神经网络在图像分类中存在限制。研究者想要利用Voronoi图来增强图像的关系数据建模能力，以提升分类性能

Method: 将图像表示为图形（像素或区域作为顶点），然后使用对应的Delaunay三角剖来精炼图形表征，最后集成图卷积神经网络进行分类

Result: 在多个标准数据集上实现了显著的预处理效率和分类准确性提升，超越了最先进的方法，特别是在复杂场景和细粒度分类任务中表现优异，通过交叉验证确认了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 这项研究不仅为图像分类提供了新的视角，还扩展了基于图形的学习范式在计算机视觉和非结构化数据分析中的应用潜力

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

### [4] [Scaling Group Inference for Diverse and High-Quality Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15773)
*Gaurav Parmar,Or Patashnik,Daniil Ostashev,Kuan-Chieh Wang,Kfir Aberman,Srinivasa Narasimhan,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的组推理方法，通过将组推理建模为二次整数分配问题，在保证样本质量的同时最大化组内多样性，解决了独立采样导致的冗余问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，用户通常需要获得一组多样化的输出（如4-8张图像），但传统的独立采样方法往往产生冗余结果，限制了用户选择和创意探索。

Method: 将组推理建模为二次整数分配问题：候选输出作为图节点，通过优化样本质量（一元项）和最大化组多样性（二元项）来选择子集。采用渐进式剪枝策略提高运行效率，可扩展到大型候选集。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法相比独立采样基线和近期推理算法，显著提高了组多样性和质量。框架可泛化到文本到图像、图像到图像、图像提示和视频生成等多种任务。

Conclusion: 该框架使生成模型能够将多个输出视为有凝聚力的组而非独立样本，为实际应用提供了更丰富的输出选择。

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

### [5] [You Only Pose Once: A Minimalist's Detection Transformer for Monocular RGB Category-level 9D Multi-Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14965)
*Hakjin Lee,Junghoon Seo,Jaehoon Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOPO是一个单阶段、基于查询的框架，将类别级9自由度姿态估计作为2D检测的自然扩展，无需额外数据即可实现高性能的物体检测和姿态估计统一


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案依赖伪深度、CAD模型或多级级联方法，需要开发更简单的仅使用RGB图像的替代方案，直接在类别级别学习

Method: 在transformer检测器基础上增加轻量级姿态头、边界框条件平移模块和6D感知匈牙利匹配成本，仅使用RGB图像和类别级姿态标签进行端到端训练

Result: 在三个基准测试中达到新SOTA，REAL275数据集上实现79.6% IoU50和54.1%的10°10cm指标，超越先前RGB-only方法并接近RGB-D系统性能

Conclusion: YOPO证明了无需额外数据即可统一物体检测和9自由度姿态估计的可行性，为机器人学和自动化提供了简洁高效的解决方案

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

### [6] [Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework for Joint Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14980)
*Andrei Balykin,Anvar Ganiev,Denis Kondranin,Kirill Polevoda,Nikolai Liudkevich,Artem Petrov*

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的训练框架Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework，通过自动匹配的真实和攻击自拍对来学习模态无关的活体检测线索，在物理和数字攻击检测任务上取得了2.10%的平均分类错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人脸识别系统使用单独的模型处理物理呈现攻击和数字伪造攻击，这增加了系统复杂性、推理延迟，并且容易受到组合攻击向量的威胁。

Method: 使用配对采样对比学习框架，利用自动匹配的真实和攻击自拍对来学习模态无关的活体检测特征，实现统一的攻击检测。

Result: 在第6届人脸反欺骗挑战赛统一物理-数字攻击检测基准上取得了2.10%的平均分类错误率(ACER)，优于现有解决方案，模型轻量(4.46 GFLOPs)且训练时间短于1小时。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种高效统一的解决方案，能够同时处理物理和数字攻击，具有实际部署的可行性，代码和预训练模型已开源。

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at

### [7] [TAIGen: Training-Free Adversarial Image Generation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15020)
*Susim Roy,Anubhooti Jain,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAIGen是一种无需训练的黑盒对抗图像生成方法，仅需3-20个采样步骤即可从无条件扩散模型生成高质量对抗样本，攻击成功率高且计算效率提升10倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有生成模型对抗攻击方法产生的图像质量低、计算资源消耗大的问题，特别是扩散模型需要数百个采样步骤的局限性

Method: 在混合步骤区间注入扰动，采用选择性RGB通道策略：对红色通道应用注意力图，对绿色和蓝色通道使用GradCAM引导的扰动，在保持图像结构的同时最大化目标模型的误分类

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，对VGGNet源模型，攻击ResNet成功率达70.6%，MNASNet达80.8%，ShuffleNet达97.8%；PSNR超过30dB，生成速度比现有扩散攻击快10倍

Conclusion: TAIGen实现了高效高质量的对抗样本生成，具有最低的鲁棒准确率，表明防御机制对其生成的图像净化效果最差，是最具影响力的攻击方法

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

*Chunming He,Fengyang Xiao,Rihan Zhang,Chengyu Fang,Deng-Ping Fan,Sina Farsiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUN++是一个可逆展开网络，通过生成式细化解决隐蔽视觉感知问题，结合掩码和RGB域的可逆建模，使用针对性扩散模型精细修复不确定区域


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐蔽视觉感知方法主要局限于掩码域，未能充分利用RGB域的潜力，需要一种能够在两个域同时应用可逆建模并有效解决不确定性的方法

Method: 提出可逆展开网络RUN++，将任务建模为数学优化问题并展开为多阶段深度网络，包含CORE模块（掩码域可逆建模）、CARE模块（RGB域可逆建模）和FINE模块（针对性Bernoulli扩散模型细化）

Result: RUN++能够有效减少假阳性和假阴性，在真实世界退化条件下保持鲁棒性，计算成本低于全图像处理

Conclusion: 该方法通过展开网络和扩散模型的协同作用，为构建鲁棒的隐蔽视觉感知系统提供了新范式，并扩展为双层优化框架

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

making automated monitoring critical for climate mitigation strategies. We
introduce GasTwinFormer, a hybrid vision transformer for real-time methane
emission segmentation and dietary classification in optical gas imaging through
a novel Mix Twin encoder alternating between spatially-reduced global attention
and locally-grouped attention mechanisms. Our architecture incorporates a
lightweight LR-ASPP decoder for multi-scale feature aggregation and enables
simultaneous methane segmentation and dietary classification in a unified
framework. We contribute the first comprehensive beef cattle methane emission
dataset using OGI, containing 11,694 annotated frames across three dietary
treatments. GasTwinFormer achieves 74.47% mIoU and 83.63% mF1 for segmentation
while maintaining exceptional efficiency with only 3.348M parameters, 3.428G
FLOPs, and 114.9 FPS inference speed. Additionally, our method achieves perfect
dietary classification accuracy (100%), demonstrating the effectiveness of
leveraging diet-emission correlations. Extensive ablation studies validate each

### [10] [CurveFlow: Curvature-Guided Flow Matching for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15093)
*Yan Luo,Drake Du,Hao Huang,Yi Fang,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CurveFlow提出了一种新的流匹配框架，通过引入曲率正则化来学习平滑的非线性轨迹，显著提升了文本到图像生成中的语义一致性和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的整流流模型基于数据和噪声分布之间的线性轨迹，这种线性性强制零曲率，可能迫使图像生成过程通过数据流形的低概率区域，影响生成图像与文本描述的语义对齐。

Method: 引入CurveFlow框架，直接在流路径中融入曲率指导，采用鲁棒的曲率正则化技术来惩罚轨迹内在动态的突变，学习平滑的非线性轨迹。

Result: 在MS COCO 2014和2017数据集上的实验表明，CurveFlow在文本到图像生成任务中达到最先进性能，在BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE和CLAIR等语义一致性指标上显著优于标准整流流变体和其他非线性基线。

Conclusion: 曲率感知建模显著增强了模型忠实遵循复杂指令的能力，同时保持高质量的图像生成效果。

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is
made publicly available at
https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/CurveFlow.

### [11] [HiRQA: Hierarchical Ranking and Quality Alignment for Opinion-Unaware Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15130)
*Vaishnav Ramesh,Haining Wang,Md Jahidul Islam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiRQA是一个自监督的无参考图像质量评估框架，通过分层排序和质量对齐方法，仅使用输入图像就能预测质量分数，无需参考图像或辅助模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无参考图像质量评估方法存在数据集偏差和依赖主观标签的问题，限制了其泛化性能。需要一种不依赖原始参考图像或推理时辅助模态的方法。

Method: 提出分层排序和质量对齐框架，结合排序学习和对比学习。使用高阶排序损失通过失真对的关系排序来监督质量预测，嵌入距离损失确保特征距离与感知差异的一致性，以及基于结构化文本提示的对比对齐损失。

Result: 仅在合成失真上训练的HiRQA能有效泛化到真实退化场景，在镜头光晕、雾霾、运动模糊和低光等各种失真条件下表现优异。轻量级变体HiRQA-S每张图像推理时间仅3.5ms。

Conclusion: HiRQA在合成和真实基准测试中展现出最先进的性能、强大的泛化能力和可扩展性，为实时部署提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

Conclusion: 提出的投资组合理论方法能有效保证多视图3D重建在边缘环境中的可靠性，为关键任务应用提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological

These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

Abstract: Existing approaches in reinforcement learning train an agent to learn desired
optimal behavior in an environment with rule based surrounding agents. In
safety critical applications such as autonomous driving it is crucial that the
rule based agents are modelled properly. Several behavior modelling strategies
and IDM models are used currently to model the surrounding agents. We present a
learning based method to derive the adversarial behavior for the rule based
agents to cause failure scenarios. We evaluate our adversarial agent against
all the rule based agents and show the decrease in cumulative reward.

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

TL;DR: TriMM是首个前馈式3D原生生成模型，通过多模态协作编码（RGB、RGBD、点云）和triplane潜在扩散模型，有效利用多模态数据生成高质量3D资产。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成模型大多局限于单模态或纯3D结构，忽略了多模态数据的互补优势，限制了训练数据集的范围和模型性能。

Method: 1）引入协作多模态编码整合模态特定特征；2）采用2D和3D辅助监督提升鲁棒性；3）基于triplane潜在扩散模型生成高质量3D资产。

Result: 在多个知名数据集上的实验表明，TriMM利用少量训练数据即可达到与大规模数据集训练模型相竞争的性能，并在RGB-D数据集上验证了多模态数据集整合的可行性。

Conclusion: TriMM通过有效利用多模态数据，在3D生成任务中实现了优异的性能，证明了多模态方法在3D内容建模中的重要性。

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效避免类间冲突、减少原型漂移，并提供可靠的原型计算保证

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

Motivation: 传播模型的顺序生成过程需要长序列步骤，现有方法如DDIM尝试减少采样步骤但构建非马尔可夫过程，但是不确定原始传播过程是否能以马尔可夫方式实现同样的效率。

Method: 提出跳过式采样机制，跳过多个中间去噪步骤，这种方法来自于与标准传播模型相同的训练目标。还将该加速技术与DDIM结合提出了增强生成方法。

Result: 在OpenAI ADM、Stable Diffusion和Open Sora等预训练传播模型上进行了大量实验，结果显示该方法能够在显著减少采样步骤的情况下实现高质量生成。

Conclusion: 通过跳过式采样进行马尔可夫方式的加速采样是预训练传播模型的内在特性，无需构建非马尔可夫过程。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence

Conclusion: 冗余分配策略通过数量丰富和几何多样化的拓扑监督，有效解决了现有方法监督范围有限的问题，提升了自动驾驶中的车道拓扑推理能力

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent
domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal
approaches in advancing patent analysis. The codebase is available here:

Motivation: 当前超声视频CHD检测方法存在图像噪声、探头位置变异性问题，现有机器学习方法往往忽略时序信息、仅限于二元分类且缺乏预测校准，需要更可靠的自动化诊断工具。

Conclusion: TPA框架通过整合时序建模、对比学习和不确定性量化，显著提升了胎儿先天性心脏病超声视频分类的准确性和临床可靠性，为自动化CHD诊断提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAG-SEG是一个无需训练的两阶段伪装目标检测方法，首先使用检索增强生成粗掩码作为提示，然后通过SAM进行精细分割，在个人笔记本上就能达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决伪装目标检测中现有方法需要大量训练和计算资源的问题，以及基础模型如SAM需要高质量提示但在COD任务中表现不佳的挑战。

Method: 将COD任务解耦为两个阶段：1）RAG阶段通过无监督聚类构建检索数据库生成粗掩码提示；2）SEG阶段使用SAM2进行精细分割。整个过程无需训练。

Result: 在基准COD数据集上的大量实验表明，RAG-SEG的性能与或超过最先进方法，且所有实验均在个人笔记本上完成，计算效率高。

Conclusion: RAG-SEG提供了一个无需训练的高效COD解决方案，在保持竞争力的同时显著降低了计算需求，具有很好的实用性。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

TL;DR: VideoEraser是一个无需训练的即插即用框架，通过选择性提示嵌入调整和抗干扰噪声引导两阶段过程，有效防止文本到视频扩散模型生成不良内容，在四个任务中平均减少46%的不良内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到视频扩散模型的快速发展引发了隐私、版权和安全方面的担忧，这些模型可能在未经授权的情况下使用个人身份、艺术作品和有害材料进行训练，导致不良内容的无控制生产和传播。

Method: 提出VideoEraser框架，采用两阶段过程：1）选择性提示嵌入调整（SPEA）来修改文本嵌入；2）抗干扰噪声引导（ARNG）来增强对不良概念的抑制。该框架无需训练，可作为即插即用模块集成到现有T2V扩散模型中。

Result: 在对象擦除、艺术风格擦除、名人擦除和显式内容擦除四个任务上进行了广泛评估，VideoEraser在效能、完整性、保真度、鲁棒性和泛化性方面均优于现有方法，平均减少46%的不良内容生成。

Conclusion: VideoEraser在抑制T2V生成中的不良内容方面达到了最先进的性能，为解决扩散模型可能带来的隐私、版权和安全问题提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

Abstract: The world is constantly moving towards AI based systems and autonomous
vehicles are now reality in different parts of the world. These vehicles
require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that.
It becomes important to for such vehicles to also predict from a distant if a
person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

Motivation: 现有Video-LLMs研究主要关注性能提升，对其内部工作机制理解有限，需要系统性的实证研究来填补这一空白。

Method: 采用注意力敲除作为主要分析工具，设计三种敲除变体（时间、空间、语言到视频），通过控制敲除层窗口进行全局和细粒度设置分析。

Result: 发现视频信息提取主要在早期层完成；中间某些层对视频问答有超常影响；时空建模更依赖语言引导检索而非视频token自注意力。

Conclusion: 这些发现可用于减少Video-LLMs的注意力计算，为未来研究提供可解释性和效率视角，是首个系统揭示Video-LLMs内部视频处理机制的工作。

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法需要更新所有模型参数，容易导致过拟合和计算成本高昂。深度学习模型计算需求大，需要更高效的迁移学习策略

Method: 采用进化算法识别需要微调的层子集，选择性微调相关层而不是全部参数，优化目标任务的模型性能

Result: 在9个图像分类数据集上评估，BioTune相比AutoRGN和LoRA等方法实现了竞争性或改进的准确率和效率

Conclusion: 通过集中微调相关层子集，BioTune减少了可训练参数数量，降低了计算成本，促进了跨不同数据特征和分布的更高效迁移学习

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

TL;DR: DriveSplat是一种基于神经高斯表示的动态-静态解耦方法，专门针对驾驶场景的高质量3D重建，通过区域体素初始化、可变形神经高斯和深度法线先验监督，在Waymo和KITTI数据集上实现了最先进的新视角合成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶场景中存在快速移动的车辆、行人和大规模静态背景，给3D场景重建带来挑战。现有基于3D高斯泼溅的方法虽然通过解耦动态静态组件处理运动模糊，但忽略了背景优化的几何关系，仅通过添加高斯来拟合训练视图，导致新视角渲染鲁棒性有限且几何表示不准确。

Method: 1) 采用区域体素初始化方案，将场景划分为近、中、远区域以增强近景细节表示；2) 引入可变形神经高斯建模非刚性动态物体，通过可学习变形网络进行时间参数调整；3) 使用预训练模型的深度和法线先验监督整个框架，提高几何结构准确性。

Conclusion: DriveSplat通过创新的动态-静态解耦策略和几何先验监督，有效解决了驾驶场景3D重建中的挑战，为高质量新视角合成提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Conclusion: 论文识别了当前方法在抽象推理任务中的局限性，并提出了改进方向，为提升深度学习模型的抽象推理能力提供了新的研究思路和方法框架。

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

Result: 在SumMe、TVSum、VideoXum和QFVS等多个数据集上超越了现有方法

Conclusion: SpiVG网络通过结合SNN的事件驱动计算和变分推理，有效提升了视频摘要的信息密度并降低了计算复杂度

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes
and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/SpiVG.

Method: 通过分析推导线性MAE学习的特征，并将分析扩展到非线性MAE，研究MAE表示如何适应数据集的空间相关性。

Result: 发现掩码比例和补丁大小可以选择捕获不同范围空间相关性的特征，MAE表示能够适应超越二阶统计量的数据集空间相关性。

Conclusion: 为实践中选择MAE超参数提供了理论见解，揭示了MAE如何通过学习空间相关性来提升表示学习效果。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Conclusion: BIRD方法通过双向时间信息传播有效解决了现有滑动窗口方法的局限性，实现了更好的检测性能和效率

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

TL;DR: MATR是一个基于Transformer的视频到视频时刻检索模型，通过双阶段序列对齐和自监督预训练，在ActivityNet-VRL和SportsMoments数据集上显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频到视频时刻检索任务需要语义帧级对齐和建模查询视频与目标视频间的复杂依赖关系，现有方法在这方面存在挑战。

Method: 提出MATR模型，使用Transformer架构进行双阶段序列对齐，编码查询和目标视频的相关性，并采用自监督预训练技术来定位视频中的随机片段。

Result: 在ActivityNet-VRL数据集上R@1提升13.1%，mIoU提升8.1%；在SportsMoments数据集上R@1提升14.7%，mIoU提升14.4%。

Conclusion: MATR通过有效的序列对齐和预训练策略，显著提升了视频到视频时刻检索的性能，证明了其在复杂视频语义匹配任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需SfM的3D高斯泼溅方法，能够在极稀疏视图（仅2张训练视图）下联合估计相机位姿和重建3D场景，显著提升渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3DGS方法严重依赖密集多视图输入和精确相机位姿，在极稀疏视图条件下SfM初始化失败导致渲染质量下降，需要解决稀疏视图下的3D重建问题。

Method: 提出密集立体模块替代SfM进行相机位姿估计和全局稠密点云重建；设计连贯视图插值模块生成额外监督信号；引入多尺度拉普拉斯一致性正则化和自适应空间感知多尺度几何正则化。

Result: 在极稀疏视图条件下（仅2张训练视图）PSNR提升2.75dB，合成图像失真最小且保留丰富高频细节，视觉质量优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了极稀疏视图下的3D重建挑战，无需SfM初始化，在渲染质量和几何结构重建方面均取得显著改进。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有轻量级模型在医学图像分割中性能与效率的权衡问题，特别是缺乏全局上下文感知能力和通道冗余问题

Method: 采用异构层内卷积核提取局部高频信息并减少通道冗余，集成稀疏Transformer-卷积混合分支捕获低频全局信息

Result: 在六个公共数据集上超越现有最先进方法，在四个未见数据集上保持优异的零样本泛化性能

Conclusion: LGMSNet在资源有限的医疗场景中具有实际部署潜力，为轻量级医学图像分割提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project
code is in https://github.com/cq-dong/LGMSNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单视角方法ECON在重建精度上存在局限，需要利用多视角信息来提升穿衣人体三维重建的几何准确性和细节捕捉能力。

Method: 提出联合多视角人体优化(JMBO)算法，跨所有输入视图拟合单个SMPL-X人体模型，确保多视角一致性；随后通过法线图集成添加几何细节，整合前后视角的法线图来捕捉服装褶皱和发型等精细表面细节。

Result: 实验结果表明，MExECON相比单视角基线方法在保真度上持续提升，与现代少样本三维重建方法相比具有竞争力，且无需重新训练网络。

Conclusion: MExECON成功扩展了单视角方法的能力，通过多视角一致性约束和法线图融合，实现了高质量穿衣人体三维重建，为稀疏多视角图像重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态图像融合方法面临模态不对齐、高频细节破坏和任务特定限制等挑战，需要开发一种能够适应不同场景和任务的通用融合框架。

Method: 提出AdaSFFuse框架，包含自适应近似小波变换(AdaWAT)进行频率解耦，以及空间-频率Mamba块进行跨域融合，通过可学习映射动态调整实现鲁棒融合。

Result: 在红外-可见光、多焦点、多曝光和医学图像融合四个任务上的大量实验表明，AdaSFFuse具有优越的融合性能，同时保持低计算成本和紧凑网络结构。

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse通过创新的频率解耦和跨域融合机制，显著提升了多模态图像融合的性能和泛化能力，在性能和效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于生成先验的方法在外推驾驶场景视图时存在几何一致性差和渲染过度平滑的问题，需要一种能够同时保持几何准确性和视觉真实性的解决方案。

Method: 提出ExtraGS框架，包含：1）基于混合高斯-SDF设计的Road Surface Gaussian表示；2）使用可学习缩放因子的Far Field Gaussians处理远距离物体；3）基于球谐函数的自监督不确定性估计框架，选择性集成生成先验。

Result: 在多个数据集、不同多相机设置和各种生成先验上的广泛实验表明，ExtraGS显著提升了外推视图的真实性和几何一致性，同时在原始轨迹上保持高保真度。

Conclusion: ExtraGS通过整合几何和生成先验的创新方法，有效解决了驾驶场景外推中的关键挑战，为自动驾驶模拟提供了更高质量的视图合成解决方案。

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

Motivation: 现有草图动画方法在处理多对象交互和复杂运动时存在困难，要么仅限于单对象情况，要么存在时间不一致性和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）运动初始化阶段交互式分割语义组并定义关键帧，通过插值生成粗略动画；2）运动细化阶段使用基于组的位移网络（GDN）预测组特定位移场，利用文本到视频模型的先验，并包含上下文条件特征增强（CCFE）等专门模块来提高时间一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在生成复杂多对象草图的高质量、时间一致动画方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GroupSketch方法扩展了草图动画的实际应用范围，能够有效处理多对象交互和复杂运动场景。

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

TL;DR: D3FNet是一种用于高分辨率遥感图像中细粒度窄路分割的深度学习网络，通过差分注意力扩张提取、双流解码融合机制和多尺度扩张策略，有效解决了窄路宽度有限、拓扑结构碎片化和遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型在处理高分辨率遥感图像中的窄路时存在困难，因为窄路宽度有限、拓扑结构碎片化且经常被遮挡，需要专门针对细粒度、遮挡和低对比度路段的方法。

Method: 基于D-LinkNet编码器-解码器架构，提出三个关键创新：差分注意力扩张提取模块增强细微道路特征并抑制背景噪声；双流解码融合机制整合原始和注意力调制特征；多尺度扩张策略（1,3,5,9）减少网格伪影并改善连续性。

Result: 在DeepGlobe和CHN6-CUG基准测试中，D3FNet在具有挑战性的道路区域实现了优异的IoU和召回率，优于最先进的基线方法。消融研究验证了注意力引导编码和双路径解码的互补协同作用。

Conclusion: D3FNet被证实为复杂遥感和协同感知场景中细粒度窄路提取的鲁棒解决方案，特别适用于处理细粒度、遮挡和低对比度的道路段。

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法存在两个主要问题：1）依赖反向传播或迭代优化，限制了可扩展性和实时部署；2）缺乏对类别条件特征分布的显式建模，影响决策边界可靠性和预测校准。

Method: 将TTA重新构建为高斯概率推理任务，使用逐渐更新的类别均值和共享协方差矩阵建模类别条件似然，实现闭式、无训练推理。引入基于CLIP先验和历史知识库的轻量级正则化来纠正可能的似然偏差。

Conclusion: ADAPT方法无需源数据、梯度更新或完整目标数据访问，支持在线和转导设置，为测试时自适应提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

Motivation: 隐式神经表示(INR)存在频谱偏差问题，倾向于学习低频分量而难以捕捉高频细节如锐利边缘和精细纹理

Method: 两阶段训练策略：第一阶段使用邻域感知软掩码自适应地为局部变化强烈的像素分配更高权重，鼓励模型早期关注细节；第二阶段进行全图像训练

Result: 实验结果表明该方法持续改善重建质量，并能与现有INR方法互补

Conclusion: 作为首个在图像INR中为像素分配频率感知重要性的尝试，为缓解频谱偏差问题提供了新途径

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了点云配准问题的求解效率，虽然目前不能解决完整的6自由度问题，但在旋转轴已知的情况下实现了快速全局最优求解。

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with

Motivation: 现有视频LLM在时间感知方面存在不足：时间戳编码隐式、帧级特征连续性差、语言视觉对齐漂移，需要更精确的时间定位和实体交互理解能力。

Method: 1. 扩散时序潜在编码器增强边界敏感性和时间一致性；2. 对象接地表示显式绑定查询实体到局部视觉证据；3. 混合令牌方案使用离散时间令牌进行显式时间戳建模

Result: 在Charades STA、NExT GQA和多个VideoQA基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，验证了强大的接地能力

Conclusion: Grounded VideoDiT通过三个关键创新成功解决了视频LLM的时间感知局限性，为细粒度时间推理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督方法，通过人工质量评级来训练评分模型，进而优化ALS数据中的树木实例分割，在正确识别树木实例方面提升了34%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机载激光扫描数据中的树木实例分割对森林监测至关重要，但由于传感器分辨率、植被状态、地形特征等因素导致数据变化大，且获取精确标注数据训练全监督方法成本高昂。

Method: 采用弱监督方法：先通过非微调模型或闭式算法获得初始分割结果，由人工操作员进行质量评级；然后使用这些评级标签训练评分模型；最后利用评分模型的反馈来微调分割模型。

Result: 该方法将原始分割模型在正确识别树木实例方面的性能提升了34%，同时显著减少了非树木实例的预测数量。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了ALS数据树木分割的挑战，但在稀疏林区（小树<2米）和复杂环境（灌木、岩石等）中性能仍有待提升，这些区域容易将非树木物体误判为树木。

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

TL;DR: 提出CFG方法，通过关键特征引导提高3D点云对抗样本的迁移性，在无需目标模型信息的情况下实现高效黑盒攻击


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中难以获取目标模型信息，现有3D对抗攻击方法依赖模型参数或输出，需要开发无需目标模型信息的迁移攻击方法

Method: 基于不同DNN架构使用一致关键特征的观察，提出关键特征引导(CFG)方法，通过计算特征重要性来正则化对抗点云搜索，优先破坏跨架构通用的关键特征，并在损失函数中约束最大偏差以确保不可感知性

Result: 在ModelNet40和ScanObjectNN基准数据集上的大量实验表明，CFG方法大幅优于现有最先进的攻击方法

Conclusion: CFG方法通过关键特征引导有效提高了3D点云对抗样本的迁移性，为黑盒攻击场景提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

Motivation: 现有在线高精地图构建方法依赖离线地图先验和多模态传感器，导致推理时计算开销大且受限于过时地图信息，需要开发更高效、低成本的视觉中心解决方案

Method: 提出MapKD框架：1）多模态教师模型（相机-LiDAR融合+SD/HD地图先验）；2）视觉中心教练模型（带先验知识和模拟LiDAR）；3）轻量级学生模型。采用Token引导2D补丁蒸馏和掩码语义响应蒸馏策略

Conclusion: MapKD通过知识蒸馏成功实现了从多模态模型到轻量级视觉模型的有效知识转移，为自动驾驶系统提供了高效、低成本的在线高精地图构建解决方案

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoD1和LoD2建筑模型缺乏详细的立面元素（如窗户、门等），而LoD3模型虽然包含这些细节但传统上需要手动建模，难以大规模应用

Method: 利用光线到模型先验分析获得冲突图(CMs)，开发语义冲突图生成器(SCMG)生成合成冲突图进行语义分割，并通过置信度分数将纹理模型分割结果与冲突图融合

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在建筑开口分割和重建方面表现有效，通过不确定性感知的纹理分割融合达到61%的性能

Conclusion: 该方法推动了自动化LoD3模型重建的进步，为可扩展和高效的三维城市建模铺平了道路

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在类别不平衡场景下微调时存在偏差，现有方法忽略了VLM预训练中固有的类别不平衡问题，导致下游任务中的偏差累积

Method: 构建包含五个视觉语义维度的综合知识库，采用动态路由机制对齐全局视觉类别、检索最优提示、平衡细粒度语义，并通过logits融合获得稳定预测

Result: 在CIFAR-LT、ImageNet-LT和Places-LT等长尾基准测试中取得了与当前SOTA方法相当的结果，动态路由计算开销极小

Conclusion: MDPR为数据不平衡下的VLM微调提供了一个灵活高效的增强方案，语义库对尾部类别特别有效

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

TL;DR: StreamMem是一种查询无关的KV缓存内存机制，用于流式视频理解，通过注意力分数压缩视觉token和通用查询token之间的KV缓存，在内存受限的长视频场景中实现高效问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理长视频时面临内存和计算开销大的问题，现有视觉压缩方法需要预先编码整个视觉上下文或提前获取问题，不适用于长视频理解和多轮对话场景。

Method: 提出StreamMem方法，以流式方式编码新视频帧，使用视觉token和通用查询token之间的注意力分数压缩KV缓存，并维护固定大小的KV内存。

Result: 在三个长视频理解和两个流式视频问答基准测试中，StreamMem在查询无关的KV缓存压缩方面达到最先进性能，与查询感知压缩方法相竞争。

Conclusion: StreamMem为长视频理解和多轮对话提供了一种高效的流式KV缓存压缩解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低了内存和计算开销。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

Motivation: 当前生成视频建模方法主要依赖RGB信号，导致在长序列中对象结构和运动出现累积错误，需要解决长视频生成中的时间一致性问题。

Method: 提出了WorldWeaver框架，联合预测感知条件和颜色信息；利用深度线索构建记忆库；采用分段噪声调度训练预测组。

Result: 在扩散模型和整流流模型上的广泛实验表明，WorldWeaver有效减少了时间漂移，提高了生成视频的保真度。

Conclusion: WorldWeaver通过统一的长期建模方案，显著提升了长视频生成的时间一致性和运动动态，为生成视频建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型（如SAM）在细粒度语义分割方面存在挑战，特别是在识别特定细胞亚型时表现不佳。需要开发能够利用分子信息来增强分割精度的新方法。

Method: 采用全栈方法：1) 通过分子赋能的标注减少像素级标注需求；2) 使用SAM适配器调整模型以关注特定语义；3) 整合分子导向校正学习(MOCL)来提升分割精度。

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

Motivation: 现有参数化人体模型在捕捉多样化姿态和形状细节方面存在困难，主要由于训练数据多样性有限和建模假设限制，且内部骨骼与外部软组织之间存在问题依赖关系，限制了直接控制身体高度和骨骼长度的能力。

Method: 使用240个同步相机捕获的60万高分辨率扫描数据学习模型，显式解耦形状和骨骼基础，将网格表示基于人体骨骼，采用非线性姿态校正来更有效地捕捉复杂姿态。

Conclusion: ATLAS通过骨骼基础的显式解耦实现了增强的形状表达能力、细粒度的身体属性定制以及独立于外部软组织特征的关键点拟合，为高保真人体建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

Conclusion: VAREdit通过自回归框架和尺度对齐机制，显著提升了图像编辑的指令遵循度和效率，为指令引导的图像编辑提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

### [66] [CineScale: Free Lunch in High-Resolution Cinematic Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15774)
*Haonan Qiu,Ning Yu,Ziqi Huang,Paul Debevec,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CineScale是一种无需调优的推理范式，能够实现更高分辨率的视觉生成，支持8K图像和4K视频生成，解决了现有方法在高分辨率生成时出现的重复模式问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉扩散模型由于缺乏高分辨率数据和计算资源限制，通常在有限分辨率下训练，限制了其生成高保真高分辨率图像或视频的能力。现有免调优方法在高分辨率生成时容易产生重复模式的低质量内容。

Method: 提出了CineScale推理范式，针对两种视频生成架构设计了专门的变体。该方法基于开源视频生成框架，支持高分辨率T2I、T2V、I2V和V2V合成。

Result: 实验验证了该范式在扩展图像和视频模型高分辨率生成能力方面的优越性，实现了无需调优的8K图像生成和仅需最小LoRA调优的4K视频生成。

Conclusion: CineScale成功解决了高分辨率视觉生成中的重复模式问题，显著提升了生成质量，为高分辨率视觉内容生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated
video samples are available at our website:

*Jianfeng Si,Lin Sun,Zhewen Tan,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 一种统一的共同训练框架，通过单个SFT阶段集成多种安全行为，支持通过系统指令动态切换行为模式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前LLM内容安全方法存在的问题：多阶段训练流程复杂、缺乏细粒度控制能力和部署后可控性

Method: 统一共同训练框架，在单个SFT阶段集成三种安全行为：积极（合法/利他）、消极（无过滤/风险倾向）和拒绝（拒绝导向/保守），通过系统指令动态激活

Result: 方法达到了与SFT+DPO相当的安全对齐质量，8B模型在安全性能上显著超过DeepSeek-R1(671B)，同时大幅降低训练复杂度和部署成本

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展、高效且高度可控的LLM内容安全解决方案，通过安全对齐边际实现了细粒度控制和部署灵活性

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

Motivation: 为WMT25机器翻译共享任务的参与者提供初步的自动评估结果，帮助他们准备系统提交论文，同时说明自动评估的局限性

Method: 使用自动指标对机器翻译系统进行评估和排名，但指出自动评估可能对使用重排序技术的系统存在偏好

Result: 生成了基于自动指标的初步排名，但强调这个排名可能存在偏差，不是最终结果

Conclusion: 自动评估排名仅供参考，最终的WMT25官方排名将基于更可靠的人工评估，届时将取代当前的自动排名

Abstract: We present the preliminary ranking of the WMT25 General Machine Translation
Shared Task, in which MT systems have been evaluated using automatic metrics.
As this ranking is based on automatic evaluations, it may be biased in favor of
systems that employ re-ranking techniques, such as Quality Estimation
re-ranking or Minimum Bayes Risk decoding. The official WMT25 ranking will be
based on human evaluation, which is more reliable and will supersede the
automatic ranking.
  The purpose of this report is not to present the final findings of the
General MT task, but rather to share preliminary results with task
participants, which may be useful when preparing their system submission
papers.

*Israel Abebe Azime,Tadesse Destaw Belay,Dietrich Klakow,Philipp Slusallek,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于大语言模型的文化本土化框架，自动化生成包含本土实体（人名、组织、货币）的多语言数学应用题数据集，以解决低资源语言中的多语言数学推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多语言数学推理在低资源语言中较英语欠缺，主要原因是缺乏反映本土文化实体的社会文化任务数据集。现有多语言指标主要通过翻译生成，保留了英语中心实体，影响了真实的多语言数学能力评估。

Method: 设计了一种LLM驱动的文化本土化框架，能够自动从现有数据源构建包含本土名称、组织和货币的数据集。该框架免除了人工注释的高成本问题，实现了真正的本土化。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，该框架能够有效减少英语中心实体偏差，并在各种语言中引入本土实体时提高模型的稳健性。还发现翻译的指标可能隐藏了真实的多语言数学能力。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有效的解决方案，通过自动化文化本土化技术，最终提升了多语言数学推理的性能和可靠性，为低资源语言的数学人工智能应用扩展了可能性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

TL;DR: 通过DPO策略使用程序化筛选的语料对语言模型进行精细调整，在斯洛文翻译任务上获得显著提升，翻译质量和一致性都超越基准模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何用较少的简单生成的数据资源来改进通用指令调整的大语言模型的机器翻译能力

Method: 使用直接偏好优化(DPO)技术，通过程序化筛选公开数据集生成质量排名的翻译对，以苹果苷等自动评估指标作为排名依据

Result: 精细调整后的模型在翻译英文维基百科文章时，COMET得分比两个基准模型分别提高0.04和0.02，更一致地避免语言和格式错误

Conclusion: 通过少量高质量数据的DPO训练可以有效提升通用语言模型的专业翻译能力，为小语种语言的机器翻译提供了可行方案

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了MultiCoXQL多语言数据集和Compass数据集，用于改进多语言对话式可解释AI系统的意图识别和自定义输入处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的对话式可解释AI系统在英语意图识别方面表现良好，但面临多语言训练数据稀缺和自定义输入支持有限的挑战。

Method: 1) 扩展MultiCoXQL多语言数据集覆盖5种语言；2) 提出新的解析方法提升多语言解析性能；3) 创建Compass数据集支持自定义输入提取；4) 使用不同规模的LLM和BERT模型进行评估。

Result: 在MultiCoXQL上评估了三种LLM的多种解析策略，在Compass上进行了单语、跨语言和多语言评估，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的多语言数据集和解析方法有效解决了ConvXAI系统在多语言环境和自定义输入处理方面的局限性，为多语言对话式可解释AI的发展提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,
employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出奖励偏移推测采样（SSS）算法，通过对齐草稿模型来降低测试时对齐的推理成本，同时保持目标模型不变，实现高效的人类偏好对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时对齐技术虽然能提升LLM的安全性和推理能力，但带来显著的推理成本，限制了实际应用。受推测采样加速技术的启发，希望解决测试时对齐的效率瓶颈。

Method: 使用奖励偏移推测采样算法，让草稿模型与人类偏好对齐，目标模型保持不变。通过修改接受标准和奖励token分布来利用对齐草稿模型与未对齐目标模型之间的分布偏移。

Result: 在测试时弱到强对齐实验中，以显著降低的推理成本获得了优越的黄金奖励分数，验证了算法的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: SSS算法能够在不实际获得RLHF最优解的情况下恢复最优解，为测试时对齐提供了一种高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

*MohamamdJavad Ardestani,Ehsan Kamalloo,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongRecall是一个三阶段召回评估框架，通过分解答案为独立事实、进行词汇和语义过滤、结构化蕴含检查来提升长文本问答的完整性评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学、法律等领域，机器生成文本的完整性至关重要，现有召回指标依赖词汇重叠容易产生错误，而LLM评估方法存在错位和幻觉问题。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) 将答案分解为自包含事实 2) 通过词汇和语义过滤逐步缩小候选匹配范围 3) 通过结构化蕴含检查验证对齐

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的长文本问答基准测试中，相比强基线方法，LongRecall在召回准确性方面取得显著提升。

Conclusion: LongRecall作为一个基础构建模块，能够减少假阳性和假阴性，适应不同的表达方式和上下文变化，为系统性召回评估提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在结构化预测任务中的幻觉和复杂推理问题，将LLM的预测能力与推理方法的结构一致性相结合

Method: 采用组合推理与LLM结合的方法，研究不同提示策略来估计LLM置信度值，并进行校准和基于结构化预测目标的微调

Result: 无论采用何种提示策略，在提示基础上增加符号推理都能带来更一致和准确的预测；结构化学习能提升挑战性任务的性能

Conclusion: 符号推理能有效提升LLM在结构化预测中的表现，结构化学习在LLM时代仍然具有重要意义

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数学数据集存在质量问题，包括弱膜的提取算法、损失的HTML到文本转换以及无法可靠保持数学结构，影响了大语言模型的推理能力培养。

Method: 设计了一个新的、域无关的管道，利用布局感知渲染和目标LLM清理阶段来恢复各种格式的数学内容，保持方程和代码块的结构完整性，同时移除模板文本并将符号标准化为LaTeX表示。

Result: 构建了Nemotron-CC-Math-3+(133B标记)和Nemotron-CC-Math-4+(52B标记)两个大规模高质量数据集。在Nemotron-T 8B模型上进行预训练后，在MATH测试集上获得+4.8到+12.6的提升，在MBPP+上获得+4.6到+14.3的提升，同时在MMLU和MMLU-Stem通用域性能上也有改善。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了第一个能够从噪声网络数据中可靠提取科学内容（包括数学）的管道，在数学、代码和通用推理能力方面都得到了可观测的提升，并为开源社区提供了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们经常提出包含错误假设的问题，这类问题没有常规答案。大型语言模型(LLM)由于幻觉现象往往会生成误导性回答，需要先识别错误假设。

Method: 将问题简化为事实验证，利用外部证据来缓解幻觉。通过检索证据、生成和验证原子假设的方法，提供可解释的答案。

Result: 在五个LLM上的实验表明：(1)整合检索到的证据是有益的；(2)生成和验证原子假设能带来更多改进，并通过指定错误假设提供可解释的答案。

Conclusion: 利用外部证据和原子假设验证的方法能有效识别和回答包含错误假设的问题，减少LLM的幻觉，提高回答的可解释性。

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

TL;DR: 提出了MMDR-Bench多模态对话推理基准和CoLVLM Agent框架，通过记忆-感知-规划-执行循环提升多模态模型的复杂推理能力，在多项指标上超越GPT-4o和Gemini 1.5 Pro。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型和多模态大模型在处理复杂多轮视觉对话任务时存在上下文丢失、视觉幻觉等问题，现有基准无法充分评估真实世界多模态交互的复杂性。

Method: 构建包含300个复杂多轮对话场景的MMDR-Bench数据集；提出CoLVLM Agent框架，采用迭代式"记忆-感知-规划-执行"循环机制，无需重新训练底层模型。

Result: CoLVLM Agent在MMDR-Bench上平均人类评估得分4.03，显著超越GPT-4o(3.92)和Gemini 1.5 Pro(3.85)，在推理深度、指令遵循和错误抑制方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架通过模块化设计和迭代方法有效解决了复杂多模态交互中的挑战，验证了在不重新训练底层模型的情况下提升多模态推理能力的可行性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

### [78] [SemToken: Semantic-Aware Tokenization for Efficient Long-Context Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15190)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemToken是一个语义感知的分词框架，通过语义聚类和异构粒度分配，显著减少token数量并提升计算效率，在长上下文建模中实现2.4倍token减少和1.9倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词方法如BPE和WordPiece仅基于频率统计，忽略了文本的语义结构，导致语义冗余span的过度分词和上下文连贯性的利用不足，特别是在长上下文场景中。

Method: 首先通过轻量级编码器提取上下文语义嵌入，进行局部语义聚类以合并语义等价的token；然后基于语义密度分配异构token粒度，在内容丰富区域使用细粒度分词，在重复或低熵span中使用粗粒度压缩。

Result: 在WikiText-103和LongBench等长上下文语言建模基准测试中，SemToken实现了高达2.4倍的token减少和1.9倍的加速，困惑度和下游任务准确率几乎没有下降。

Conclusion: 语义结构为优化大语言模型中的分词和计算提供了一个有前景的新方向，SemToken框架可以无缝集成到现代语言模型和注意力加速方法中。

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

TL;DR: Fin-PRM是一个专门针对金融领域的流程奖励模型，通过整合步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，在金融推理任务中显著优于通用PRMs和领域基线模型。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的流程奖励模型(PRMs)主要针对通用或STEM领域训练，在金融等专业领域中表现不足，因为金融推理更具结构化、符号化特征，且对事实和监管准确性更敏感。

Method: 开发了Fin-PRM，一个领域专业化的轨迹感知PRM，整合步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，支持离线/在线奖励学习，应用于监督微调、强化学习和测试时推理三个关键场景。

Result: 在CFLUE和FinQA金融推理基准测试中，Fin-PRM在轨迹选择质量上持续优于通用PRMs和强领域基线。下游模型性能提升显著：监督学习提升12.9%，强化学习提升5.2%，测试时性能提升5.1%。

Conclusion: 领域专业化的奖励建模对于使大语言模型与专家级金融推理对齐具有重要价值，Fin-PRM为金融领域的中间推理监督提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our

### [80] [SparK: Query-Aware Unstructured Sparsity with Recoverable KV Cache Channel Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15212)
*Huanxuan Liao,Yixing Xu,Shizhu He,Guanchen Li,Xuanwu Yin,Dong Li,Emad Barsoum,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARK是一种无需训练即插即用的KV缓存压缩方法，通过在通道级别应用非结构化稀疏性来减少内存使用，同时保持模型精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法主要沿时间轴进行压缩，忽略了特征维度（通道轴）上的细粒度重要性变化，导致效率和准确性平衡受限

Method: 提出通道级别的KV剪枝方法，在注意力计算过程中动态恢复被剪枝的条目，与现有压缩和量化技术正交兼容

Result: 在相同内存预算下可处理更长序列，同等序列长度下KV缓存存储减少30%以上，即使80%剪枝率下性能下降小于5%

Conclusion: SPARK通过通道级别的稀疏性处理有效解决了KV缓存瓶颈问题，在保持模型精度的同时显著提升了内存效率

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Selct2Know (S2K) 是一个成本效益高的框架，通过内部-外部知识自选择策略和选择性监督微调来内化领域知识，在医疗、法律和金融QA基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用QA表现良好，但在领域特定场景中表现不佳。检索增强生成存在幻觉和延迟问题，而持续预训练成本高且缺乏跨域灵活性。领域知识的长尾分布导致部分有用内部知识未被充分利用。

Method: 提出Selct2Know框架，采用内部-外部知识自选择策略和选择性监督微调。引入结构化推理数据生成流程，并整合GRPO来增强推理能力。模拟人类学习的渐进式知识获取过程：先理解概念，再应用于复杂推理。

Result: 在医疗、法律和金融QA基准测试中，S2K始终优于现有方法，并以显著更低的成本达到领域预训练LLM的水平。

Conclusion: S2K框架通过渐进式知识内化策略有效解决了领域特定QA的挑战，证明了模拟人类学习过程的知识获取方法的有效性，为领域适应提供了成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEER是一种自引导方法，通过从持续更新的经验池中进行细粒度逐步检索，解决LLM在多步骤工具使用中的工具选择、参数生成和工具链规划问题，无需手动设计演示或检索静态库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动设计任务特定演示或从策划库中检索，需要大量专家努力，随着工具多样性和任务难度增加，提示工程变得复杂低效。

Method: 提出Stepwise Experience Recall (SEER)方法，从持续更新的经验池进行细粒度逐步检索，增量式扩充经验池，包含过去成功的轨迹。

Result: 在ToolQA基准测试中，SEER在简单问题上平均提升6.1%，困难问题上提升4.7%。在τ-bench真实场景中，使用Qwen2.5-7B和Qwen2.5-72B模型分别获得7.44%和23.38%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: SEER方法能够有效解决LLM在多步骤工具使用中的挑战，通过自引导的经验检索实现持续性能改进，无需依赖静态或手动策划的库。

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在生成任务自动评估中选择性使用检查表的有效性，发现选择性使用在成对比较任务中能提升评估性能，但在直接评分中效果不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成任务自动评估中面临标准模糊的挑战，自动生成检查表是一种有前景但尚未充分探索的方法。

Method: 使用六种方法生成检查表，在八种模型规模上进行实验，通过成对比较和直接评分任务评估检查表效果，并分析检查表项与人工评估的相关性。

Result: 选择性使用检查表在成对比较设置中倾向于提高评估性能，但在直接评分中益处不太一致。即使与人工评分相关性低的检查表项也常反映人工编写的标准。

Conclusion: 需要更清晰地定义客观评估标准来指导人工和自动评估，因为研究发现人工评估存在潜在的不一致性。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

*Hanling Zhang,Yayu Zhou,Tongcheng Fang,Zhihang Yuan,Guohao Dai,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VocabTailor是一个解耦的动态词汇选择框架，通过卸载嵌入和混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，显著减少小语言模型词汇相关组件的内存占用达99%，且性能损失极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在资源受限环境中部署时，词汇相关组件（嵌入和语言建模头）由于词汇量大而占用大量内存，现有静态词汇剪枝方法存在信息损失和灵活性不足的问题。

Method: 基于词汇局部性原则和计算特性不对称性，提出VocabTailor框架：通过卸载嵌入实现内存优化，采用混合静态-动态词汇选择策略按需加载词汇组件。

Result: 在多样化下游任务中，VocabTailor将词汇相关组件内存使用减少高达99%，任务性能仅有极小或没有下降，显著优于现有静态词汇剪枝方法。

Conclusion: VocabTailor有效解决了小语言模型在边缘设备部署中的内存瓶颈问题，通过动态词汇选择实现了内存效率与模型性能的良好平衡。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在英语中指令跟随表现优异，但在泰语等低资源语言中的性能很少被研究。现有的测试集多依赖翻译，缺乏真实使用所需的文化和领域特定细节。

Method: 构建WangchanThaiInstruct数据集，覆盛56个专业领域和7种任务类型。通过注释员、领域专家和AI研究人员的多阶段质量控制过程制作。进行两个研究：(1)零样本评估显示在文化和专业特定任务上的性能差距；(2)指令微调研究分离原生监督的效果。

Result: 使用WangchanThaiInstruct微调的模型在领域内外测试中都超过使用翻译数据的模型。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了需要基于文化和专业背景的指令数据来改善LLM在低资源、语言多样性环境中的对齐性能。

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决代码切换语音技术中数据集稀缺的问题，推动多语言语音系统的发展

Method: 使用SWORDS算法（同义词替换单词），在保持句子语义的前提下，通过翻译替换选定单词来生成代码切换语音

Result: CS-FLEURS语料库在客观和主观指标上都表现出高可懂度和自然度，与现有数据集性能相当

Conclusion: 该方法有望推动代码切换语音技术的发展，构建更具包容性的多语言系统

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了EMNLP框架，用于评估教师角色大语言模型的心理特征、道德发展阶段和伦理风险，发现教师角色LLM比人类教师更理想化、在抽象道德推理上表现更好但情感复杂情境处理较差，且推理能力强的模型更容易受到有害提示注入攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型职业模拟缺乏全面的心理和伦理评估，特别是在教育领域需要评估教师角色的道德规范和伦理风险。

Method: 构建EMNLP框架，扩展现有量表并创建88个教师特定道德困境，使用针对性软提示注入集评估教师角色LLM的合规性和脆弱性，在12个LLM上进行实验。

Result: 教师角色LLM表现出比人类教师更理想化和两极化的个性特征，在抽象道德推理方面表现优异但在情感复杂情境中表现不佳；推理能力强的模型更容易受到有害提示注入攻击；模型温度等超参数对风险行为影响有限。

Conclusion: 本文提出了首个评估教师角色LLM伦理和心理对齐的基准，揭示了能力与安全性之间的悖论，为教育AI的伦理安全评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.
This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological
alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at

Motivation: 解决检索增强生成(RAG)中当检索到的外部知识与LLM参数知识冲突时，模型无法正确处理的上下文-记忆冲突问题

Method: 提出Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation (CARE)，包含上下文评估器和基础LLM。上下文评估器通过压缩记忆token嵌入和基于grounded/adversarial的软提示训练，来识别不可靠上下文并指导推理

Result: 在QA和事实核查基准测试中平均获得5.0%的性能提升，有效缓解了上下文-记忆冲突

Conclusion: CARE为构建可信赖和自适应的RAG系统提供了一个有前景的方向

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种利用大语言模型自动挖掘时间常识的管道，构建了TComQA数据集，并在时间问答任务中取得了优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解事件需要掌握其时间上下文，但时间常识在自然语言中往往不会明确表述。即使先进的大语言模型也难以生成需要时间常识推理的文本，因此自动挖掘时间常识对于构建鲁棒的语言模型至关重要。

Method: 提出了一个时间常识提取管道，利用大语言模型从SAMSum和RealNews语料库中自动挖掘时间常识，构建TComQA数据集，并通过众包验证数据质量。

Result: TComQA数据集在提取时间常识方面达到了超过80%的精确度，使用该数据集训练的模型在时间问答任务上表现优于基于现有数据集微调的大语言模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效自动挖掘时间常识，构建高质量数据集，并提升模型在时间推理任务上的性能，为构建更鲁棒的语言模型提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

Motivation: 许多语音处理任务需要不受上下文影响的纯音素表示，但现有方法通常需要分析长语音段和语言特定模式

Method: 处理短固定宽度窗口（约一个音素长度），独立分析每个窗口，学习所有语言共有的基本声学模式

Result: 在监督和自监督训练中，包括UCLA语音语料库的零样本测试，展现出强大的跨语言泛化能力

Conclusion: 通过建模音素长度窗口内的基本声学模式，可以实现有效的通用语音处理

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

Motivation: 知识图补全模型的评估存在跨数据集和多指标不一致性问题，同一模型在不同数据集或不同指标下表现冲突，影响模型选择和评估的可靠性

Method: 提出EDAS（Distance from Average Solution）元评估指标，通过计算模型与平均解决方案的距离，将多个数据集和多种评估指标（如MRR、Hit@k等）的性能继效果集成为一个标准化的单一分数（M_i ∈ [0,1]）

Result: 在FB15k-237和WN18RR等标准数据集上的实验结果显示，EDAS能够有效整合多指标多数据集的性能表现，产生统一的模型排名，提供了一致、稳健且可推广的评估框架

Conclusion: EDAS作为一种新的元评估指标，充分解决了知识图补全模型评估中的跨数据集和多指标不一致性问题，为更加可靠和可解释的模型选择提供了全局视角，促进了跨数据集评估的公平性

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

### [93] [Unveiling Trust in Multimodal Large Language Models: Evaluation, Analysis, and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15370)
*Yichi Zhang,Yao Huang,Yifan Wang,Yitong Sun,Chang Liu,Zhe Zhao,Zhengwei Fang,Huanran Chen,Xiao Yang,Xingxing Wei,Hang Su,Yinpeng Dong,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiTrust-X是一个全面的多模态大语言模型可信度评估基准，包含32个任务和28个数据集，评估了30多个模型，揭示了当前模型在真实性、鲁棒性、安全性、公平性和隐私方面的显著漏洞，并提出了推理增强的安全对齐方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型评估方法往往关注狭窄方面，忽视了多模态性带来的风险，需要建立一个全面的可信度评估框架。

Method: 提出了三维框架：五个可信度维度（真实性、鲁棒性、安全性、公平性、隐私）、两种新型风险类型（多模态风险和跨模态影响）、多种缓解策略（数据、模型架构、训练、推理算法）。基于此构建了MultiTrust-X基准。

Result: 实验发现当前模型存在显著漏洞，可信度与通用能力之间存在差距，多模态训练和推理会放大基础LLM的潜在风险。现有缓解策略存在局限性，多数方法在改善特定方面时会产生意外权衡。

Conclusion: 提出了推理增强的安全对齐（RESA）方法，通过思维链推理能力发现潜在风险，取得了最先进的结果，为未来改进提供了实用见解。

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于信息论的置信度调制推测解码框架，通过动态调整推测生成长度和灵活验证标准，在保持生成质量的同时显著加速自回归推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法使用静态生成长度和刚性验证标准，无法适应不同模型不确定性和输入复杂度，限制了加速效果和适应性

Method: 基于信息熵和边界不确定性的置信度调制机制，动态调整每轮推测生成的token数量，并使用相同置信度信号调制验证过程，实现更灵活的token接受

Result: 在机器翻译和摘要任务上相比标准推测解码获得显著加速，同时保持或改进了BLEU和ROUGE分数

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个原则性的即插即用解决方案，能够在不同不确定性条件下实现高效稳健的大语言模型解码

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

### [95] [Exploiting Vocabulary Frequency Imbalance in Language Model Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15390)
*Woojin Chung,Jeonghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过实验证明较大的词汇表能够降低文本的复杂性，主要通过减少高频词的不确定性来改善语言模型性能，而非减少词汇不平衡的负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型中较大词汇表带来性能改善的真正原因，因为当前实践偏向于使用越来越大的词汇表，但其好处源头不清。

Method: 进行受控实验，在保持数据、计算资源和优化固定的情况下，将语言模型的词汇表从24K扩展到196K，并使用Kolmogorov复杂性来量化分词文本的复杂性。

Result: 较大词汇表能降低分词文本的复杂性，主要通过降低前2,500个高频词的交叉熵来改善模型性能，而尾部稀有词的损失反而上升。约77%的下游测试分数来自这些高频词。

Conclusion: 词汇表扩大的好处实质上是通过降低分词文本的复杂性来实现的，模型利用了词汇不平衡而非受其影响。这为分词器与模型的协同设计提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a
result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation
with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to
inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified
benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on
approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics
and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges
and outline promising directions for future work.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MCR-BENCH基准测试，发现大型音频-语言模型在处理音频-文本冲突信息时存在明显的文本偏向性，导致音频中心任务性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频-语言模型的多模态处理能力虽然增强，但其在处理音频与文本冲突信息时的表现尚未得到充分研究，存在可靠性隐患。

Method: 开发MCR-BENCH基准测试，通过不一致的音频-文本对评估模型的信息优先级选择，并进行监督微调实验和置信度分析。

Result: 模型在模态冲突时显著偏向文本输入，忽视音频证据，导致音频任务性能大幅下降，且即使在矛盾输入下仍表现出过度自信。

Conclusion: 需要在训练中改进模态平衡，开发更复杂的融合机制来增强处理冲突多模态输入的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

TL;DR: LLaSO是首个完全开源的大规模语音语言建模端到端框架，包含对齐语料库、指令调优数据集和可复现基准测试，并发布了3.8B参数的参考模型，建立了一个强大的可复现基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语音语言模型（LSLMs）的发展因架构碎片化和缺乏透明度而受阻，社区普遍只发布模型权重而不公开训练数据和配置，阻碍了系统比较和研究的可复现性。

Method: 提出了LLaSO框架，包含三个核心资源：1）1200万实例的语音-文本对齐语料库LLaSO-Align；2）1350万实例的多任务指令调优数据集LLaSO-Instruct；3）可复现的标准化评估基准LLaSO-Eval。基于这些资源训练了3.8B参数的LLaSO-Base参考模型。

Result: LLaSO-Base模型取得了0.72的标准化分数，超越了同类可比模型，建立了强大的可复现基线。分析发现，虽然更广泛的训练覆盖能提升性能，但在未见任务上仍存在显著的泛化差距，特别是在纯音频场景中。

Conclusion: 通过完整发布数据、基准测试和模型，LLaSO为LSLMs研究建立了基础性的开放标准，有助于统一研究努力并加速社区驱动的进展。

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

Abstract: Recent developments in language modeling have increased their use in various
applications and domains. Language models, often trained on sensitive data, can
memorize and disclose this information during privacy attacks, raising concerns
about protecting individuals' privacy rights. Preserving privacy in language
models has become a crucial area of research, as privacy is one of the
fundamental human rights. Despite its significance, understanding of how much
privacy risk these language models possess and how it can be mitigated is still
limited. This research addresses this by providing a comprehensive study of the
privacy-preserving language modeling approaches. This study gives an in-depth
overview of these approaches, highlights their strengths, and investigates
their limitations. The outcomes of this study contribute to the ongoing
research on privacy-preserving language modeling, providing valuable insights

Conclusion: 虽然部分非对应词汇已经有专业转换方法，但仍有很多词汇需要进一步研究，本研究为语言翻译领域提供了有用的方法论和实践案例。

Abstract: These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into
English and Russian languages.

Motivation: 现有的可编程任务导向对话代理的有效性依赖于准确的对话状态跟踪，需要一种更有效的状态跟踪和错误校正方法。

Method: PyTOD生成可执行代码来跟踪对话状态，采用简单的约束解码方法，使用语言模型而非语法规则来遵循API模式，利用策略和执行反馈进行高效错误校正。

Result: 在具有挑战性的SGD基准测试中实现了最先进的对话状态跟踪性能，在准确性和鲁棒性用户目标估计方面均超越了强基线模型。

Conclusion: 执行感知的状态跟踪方法有效，PyTOD展示了通过代码生成和约束解码实现高效对话状态跟踪的可行性。

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,
demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

TL;DR: RadReason是一个新的放射学报告评估框架，提供细粒度错误类型评分和人类可读的解释，超越了现有方法并达到与GPT-4相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前放射学报告自动评估缺乏临床基础、可解释性和细粒度指标，现有方法要么评分粗糙，要么依赖不透明的黑盒模型，限制了在真实临床工作中的应用价值。

Method: 基于Group Relative Policy Optimization，引入了两个关键创新：(1)子分数动态加权，根据实时F1统计自适应优先处理临床挑战性错误类型；(2)多数引导优势缩放，基于子分数一致性调整策略梯度更新。

Result: 在ReXVal基准测试中，RadReason超越了所有现有离线指标，达到与GPT-4评估相当的性能，同时保持可解释性、成本效益和临床部署适用性。

Conclusion: RadReason提供了一个临床基础、可解释且细粒度的放射学报告评估框架，解决了现有方法的局限性，为临床工作流程提供了实用且可靠的评估工具。

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 个性化营销能显著提升转化率和客户满意度，研究表明良好执行的个性化策略可使收入提升达40%，因此需要开发智能的、数据驱动的优惠生成方法。

Method: 通过对比学习方法微调预训练的T5-Small编码器-解码器语言模型，使用InfoNCE损失在共享嵌入空间中对齐客户画像和相关优惠，引入自适应学习行为重塑潜在空间。

Result: 在模拟客户行为和优惠接受模式的合成数据集上评估，实验结果显示相比监督微调基线，优惠接受率提升了17%。

Conclusion: 对比学习目标在推进个性化营销方面具有显著效果，SLM4Offer模型通过创新的对比学习方法有效提升了优惠生成的个性化效果。

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

Motivation: 质疑大型语言模型能否有效处理用户主观性的浏览行为和偏好，这种行为形成了每个用户独特的"浏览语言"。

Method: 提出HeTLM方法，采用页面级别分词器训练小型模型，通过异质性聚类特定参数集来捕捉不同用户群体的行为特征。

Conclusion: 对于主观性行为模拟，小型专门化模型组合异质性聚类训练比单一大型模型更有效，能够提升用户层面的对齐效果。

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，使用基于模型训练影响的难度度量（训练数据影响力）进行课程学习，相比传统人为定义的难度度量，能够使语言模型预训练性能提升超过10个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的课程学习在语言模型预训练中效果有限，主要是因为人类定义的难度度量与模型实际训练过程中观察到的示例难度不匹配。

Method: 提出使用训练数据影响力作为难度度量来排序训练示例，这种方法更贴近模型训练过程中观察到的示例难度。

Result: 使用基于训练数据影响力的课程学习方法训练的模型，在基准测试中比随机顺序训练的模型性能高出10个百分点以上。

Conclusion: 课程学习对语言模型预训练是有益的，但需要采用更符合模型中心视角的难度概念，而不是传统的人类中心难度度量。

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric

TL;DR: SLM-Bench是首个专门评估小型语言模型(SLMs)的基准测试，从准确性、计算效率和可持续性三个维度对15个SLM在9个NLP任务上进行全面评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对小型语言模型性能和环境影响系统性评估的基准测试，需要建立标准化的评估框架来比较不同SLM的效率权衡。

Method: 开发SLM-Bench基准测试，在4种硬件配置下评估15个SLM在9个NLP任务上的表现，使用23个数据集覆盖14个领域，量化11个正确性、计算和能耗指标。

Result: 评估发现不同SLM在准确性和能效方面存在显著权衡，部分模型准确性优异，而另一些模型能效表现更佳。

Conclusion: SLM-Bench为SLM评估设立了新标准，填补了资源效率与实际应用之间的评估空白，提供了开源基准测试工具促进可复现性研究。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and
accessibility, yet a systematic evaluation of their performance and
environmental impact remains lacking. We introduce SLM-Bench, the first
benchmark specifically designed to assess SLMs across multiple dimensions,
including accuracy, computational efficiency, and sustainability metrics.
SLM-Bench evaluates 15 SLMs on 9 NLP tasks using 23 datasets spanning 14
domains. The evaluation is conducted on 4 hardware configurations, providing a
rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench
quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption,
enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation
considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across
models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized
evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our
findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel
in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a
new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency
and real-world applicability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HebID是首个希伯来语多标签社会身份检测语料库，包含5536个以色列政客Facebook帖子，标注了12种细粒度社会身份，使用希伯来语调优的LLM获得最佳性能（F1=0.74），用于分析精英话语与公众身份认同的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有身份检测数据集主要针对英语、单标签且类别粗糙，缺乏对希伯来语等非英语政治语境中 nuanced 社会身份的研究。

Method: 构建HebID语料库（5536个句子，12种社会身份标注），比较多标签/单标签编码器和2B-9B参数生成式LLM，应用分类器分析政客社交媒体和议会演讲。

Result: 希伯来语调优的LLM表现最佳（macro-F1=0.74），发现了身份表达的流行度差异、时间趋势、聚类模式和性别相关变化。

Conclusion: HebID为希伯来语社会身份研究提供了全面基础，可作为其他非英语政治语境类似研究的模型，揭示了精英话语与公众身份优先级的差异。

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

Abstract: We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model
to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially,
Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel
through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing
diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B
demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including
arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed
trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training
techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive
token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct
to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.

TL;DR: 首个大规模政治去合法化话语(PDD)计算研究，构建希伯来语语料库并开发两阶段分类模型，发现PDD在过去30年显著增加，社交媒体比议会辩论更普遍，右翼政客使用更多。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究政治去合法化话语(PDD)的自动分析可行性，通过大规模计算研究理解民主话语中的规范性攻击模式。

Method: 构建包含10,410个句子的希伯来语语料库，手动标注1,812个PDD实例；开发两阶段分类管道，结合微调编码器模型和解码器LLM。

Result: 最佳模型(DictaLM 2.0)在二元PDD检测中F1得分0.74，特征分类中宏F1得分0.67；发现PDD在过去30年显著增加，社交媒体比议会辩论更普遍，右翼政客使用更多。

Conclusion: 自动化PDD分析对于理解民主话语具有可行性和重要价值，能够揭示政治话语中的去合法化模式及其随时间、平台和政治倾向的变化。

Abstract: We present the first large-scale computational study of political
delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative
validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel
Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches
(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which
1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To
this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However,
existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which
causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant
redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce
SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction
of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive
safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by
orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and
resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure
process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the
automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains
23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our
contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a
comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on
our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and
efficiency.

TL;DR: SDGO是一个自判别引导的强化学习框架，通过利用LLM自身的判别能力作为奖励信号来增强生成安全性，无需额外标注数据或外部模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLM作为判别器识别有害请求的能力强于作为生成器防御有害请求的能力，存在安全不一致性，希望通过对齐这两种能力来提升模型安全性。

Method: 提出SDGO框架，使用强化学习，将模型自身的判别能力作为奖励信号，通过迭代自我改进来增强生成安全性。

Result: SDGO显著提高了模型安全性，在保持通用基准上有用性的同时，对分布外越狱攻击表现出鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 通过对齐判别和生成能力，SDGO实现了更紧密的能力耦合，仅需少量判别样本就能进一步增强生成能力，为LLM安全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.

Conclusion: 综述生成任务复杂度高，需要持续研究，所有代码、数据和模型已开源。

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and
models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 位置偏差严重影响长上下文的理解和处理能力，现有方法通过修改架构来缓解但效果有限，需要更有效的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Pos2Distill知识蒸馏框架，利用位置间的固有差异来对抗位置偏差本身，设计了针对检索和推理范式的两种具体实现：Pos2Distill-R¹和Pos2Distill-R²。

Result: 在长上下文检索和推理任务中，所有上下文位置都实现了增强的一致性和显著的性能提升，两个专门化系统展现出强大的跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: Pos2Distill框架有效缓解了位置偏差问题，通过知识蒸馏方法实现了位置间能力的均衡转移，在长上下文处理任务中取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

Motivation: 孟加拉语作为全球第七大语言拥有3亿母语者，但在数字领域代表性不足，缺乏标注数据集和资源。词干提取作为语言分析的关键预处理步骤，对孟加拉语这种低资源高屈折语言尤为重要。

Method: 通过对现有孟加拉语词干提取方法的全面调查和分析，批判性评估现有研究方法论，识别研究空白和实施可复现性问题。

Result: 发现现有文献存在显著断层，可复现实现稀缺，评估方法需要更相关的度量标准。孟加拉语的丰富形态和方言多样性带来了特殊挑战。

Conclusion: 建议孟加拉语词干提取器的发展方向，倡导开发强大的词干提取器并持续研究，以提升孟加拉语的语言分析和处理能力。

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

Motivation: 电商平台拥有丰富的多模态数据，但现有数据集在规模和设计上有限，难以系统研究图像是否真正增强产品理解能力，还是可能引入冗余或降低性能。

Method: 构建了包含406,190样本和8,989,510图像的EcomMMMU数据集，包含8个核心任务和专门的VSS子集；提出了SUMEI方法，通过预测视觉效用来策略性地使用多张图像进行下游任务。

Result: 分析发现产品图像并不总能提升性能，有时反而会降低效果，表明MLLMs在有效利用丰富视觉内容进行电商任务方面存在困难；SUMEI方法在综合实验中展现出有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在电商任务中难以有效利用视觉内容，需要开发像SUMEI这样的数据驱动方法来策略性地选择和利用图像信息，以提升模型性能。

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/submission25.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

TL;DR: ReasonZoo基准测试表明，工具集成推理(TIR)能显著提升大语言模型在数学和非数学推理任务中的表现，并通过新指标PAC和AUC-PCC证明TIR提高了推理效率，减少了过度思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在推理任务上取得进展，但在精确计算方面仍有不足。工具集成推理(TIR)被提出作为解决方案，但其对LLM推理能力的泛化效果和改进机制尚不明确。

Method: 提出了ReasonZoo基准测试，涵盖九个不同推理类别，用于评估TIR在各领域的有效性。同时提出了两个新指标：性能感知成本(PAC)和性能-成本曲线下面积(AUC-PCC)来评估推理效率。

Result: 实证评估显示，启用TIR的模型在数学和非数学任务中都持续优于非TIR模型。TIR提高了推理效率，表现为改进的PAC和AUC-PCC指标，表明减少了过度思考并实现了更简化的推理。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了TIR的领域通用优势及其在提升LLM复杂推理任务能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: LiveMCP-101为评估真实世界代理能力设定了严格标准，推动通过工具使用可靠执行复杂任务的自主AI系统发展。

Abstract: Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact
with the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol
(MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is
a significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve
multi-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In
this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated
real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,
that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file
operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a
novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather
than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world
environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate
below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed
ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and
inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing
current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world
agent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably
execute complex tasks through tool use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有混合现实重照明技术在性能、准确性和计算复杂度方面的挑战，特别是深度学习方法超出设备性能限制，场景重建不准确，以及2D图像滤镜方法无法处理复杂几何和阴影

Method: 结合图像分割技术、基于同异向扩散的照明传播算法，以及基础场景理解技术，综合了计算简单性和效果准确性

Result: 方法能够缩正设备扫描错误，在边缘设备上实现高达100 fps的实时重照明效果，生成视觉上吸引人且准确的照明效果

Conclusion: 该方法为混合现实场景重照明提供了一种高效、准确且实时的解决方案，在实际应用中如房地产可视化等场景中展示了良好的效果

Abstract: Mixed Reality scene relighting, where virtual changes to lighting conditions
realistically interact with physical objects, producing authentic illumination
and shadows, can be used in a variety of applications. One such application in
real estate could be visualizing a room at different times of day and placing
virtual light fixtures. Existing deep learning-based relighting techniques
typically exceed the real-time performance capabilities of current MR devices.
On the other hand, scene understanding methods, such as on-device scene
reconstruction, often yield inaccurate results due to scanning limitations, in
turn affecting relighting quality. Finally, simpler 2D image filter-based
approaches cannot represent complex geometry and shadows. We introduce a novel
method to integrate image segmentation, with lighting propagation via
anisotropic diffusion on top of basic scene understanding, and the
computational simplicity of filter-based techniques. Our approach corrects
on-device scanning inaccuracies, delivering visually appealing and accurate
relighting effects in real-time on edge devices, achieving speeds as high as
100 fps. We show a direct comparison between our method and the industry
standard, and present a practical demonstration of our method in the
aforementioned real estate example.

TL;DR: DeCoDi是一种针对文本到图像扩散模型的去偏方法，通过改变推理过程来避免潜在维度中的偏见概念区域，无需复杂干预或显著计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习去偏方法通常需要复杂或计算密集的干预，而DeCoDi旨在仅改变推理过程，使其对更广泛的实践者更加易用。

Method: 改变扩散过程以避免潜在维度中的偏见概念区域，该方法不改变图像质量，计算开销可忽略，适用于任何基于扩散的图像生成模型。

Result: 通过对护士、消防员和CEO等概念进行性别、种族和年龄的去偏处理，人工评估1200张生成图像显示该方法有效缓解了基于这些属性的偏见。GPT4o的自动偏见评估与人工评估在统计上无显著差异。

Conclusion: DeCoDi方法有潜力显著提高基于扩散的文本到图像生成模型生成图像的多样性，评估结果显示评估者间具有可靠的一致性水平和对受保护属性的更好覆盖。

Abstract: We propose DeCoDi, a debiasing procedure for text-to-image diffusion-based
models that changes the inference procedure, does not significantly change
image quality, has negligible compute overhead, and can be applied in any
diffusion-based image generation model. DeCoDi changes the diffusion process to
avoid latent dimension regions of biased concepts. While most deep learning
debiasing methods require complex or compute-intensive interventions, our
method is designed to change only the inference procedure. Therefore, it is
more accessible to a wide range of practitioners. We show the effectiveness of
the method by debiasing for gender, ethnicity, and age for the concepts of
nurse, firefighter, and CEO. Two distinct human evaluators manually inspect
1,200 generated images. Their evaluation results provide evidence that our
method is effective in mitigating biases based on gender, ethnicity, and age.
We also show that an automatic bias evaluation performed by the GPT4o is not
significantly statistically distinct from a human evaluation. Our evaluation
shows promising results, with reliable levels of agreement between evaluators
and more coverage of protected attributes. Our method has the potential to
significantly improve the diversity of images it generates by diffusion-based
text-to-image generative models.

Conclusion: 该方法通过语言驱动的社交交互显著提升了群体模拟的现实性，让群体行为自然活现于环境设置中

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

TL;DR: 提出完全基于频谱的神经符号推理架构，使用图信号处理作为核心计算框架，将整个推理流程置于图谱域中处理，在多个基准数据集上展现出优于现有方法的逻辑一致性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理模型通常将频谱图方法作为外围组件，而本文旨在开发一个完全在频谱域中运行的推理框架，以提供更数学基础和计算效率的推理系统。

Method: 将逻辑实体和关系编码为图信号，通过可学习的频谱滤波器控制多尺度信息传播，并映射到符号谓词进行基于规则的推理，包括图傅里叶变换、频带选择性注意力和频谱规则接地等完整数学框架。

Result: 在ProofWriter、EntailmentBank、bAbI、CLUTRR和ARC-Challenge等基准推理数据集上的实验显示，相比最先进的神经符号模型，在逻辑一致性、可解释性和计算效率方面都有改进。

Conclusion: 图信号处理为构建鲁棒且可解释的推理系统提供了数学基础和计算效率的底层支撑，证明了完全频谱推理架构的有效性。

Abstract: We propose a fully spectral, neuro\-symbolic reasoning architecture that
leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone
for integrating symbolic logic and neural inference. Unlike conventional
reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components,
our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral
domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals,
processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information
propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We
present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including
graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule
grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter,
EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in
logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over
state\-of\-the\-art neuro\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP
provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for
robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的计算框架，通过目标指向状态表征让世界模型的描述性和规范性两个方面从机器人与环境互动中共同涉水而生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的目的行为计算模型（如强化学习）将状态表征和奖励函数作为独立组件，这篇论文探索了这两者从目标中相互依存共同涉求的可能性。

Method: 基于佛教认知论，提出了目标指向状态（telic states）的概念，它们定义为目标等价经验分布的类别，通过行为策略与期望经验特征之间的统计分散来实现目标指向学习。

Result: 这种方法提供了一种简洁的目标指向学习理论，能够统一解释行为、现象学和神经维度的目的行为。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解自然和人工智能中的目的行为提供了新的视角，有望成为跨资产的统一理论基础。

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

TL;DR: Collab-REC是一个多智能体框架，通过三个LLM智能体（个性化、流行度、可持续性）从不同角度生成旅游推荐，再通过非LLM调解器进行多轮协商，有效提升推荐多样性和平衡性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决旅游推荐中的流行度偏见问题，避免过度旅游，提升推荐多样性，让更多小众目的地得到关注。

Method: 使用三个基于LLM的智能体（个性化、流行度、可持续性）分别生成城市建议，然后通过非LLM调解器进行多轮协商和整合，惩罚重复或无关响应。

Result: 在欧洲城市查询实验中，相比单智能体基线，Collab-REC显著提升了推荐多样性和整体相关性，能够推荐更多被忽视的小众目的地。

Conclusion: 多利益相关方协作的LLM驱动推荐系统具有很大潜力，能够提供更平衡、上下文感知的推荐，更好地满足用户约束条件。

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract
popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our
setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and
Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A
non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round
negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing
spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with
constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder
collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统评估了大语言模型的信心检验准确性，发现增加推理资源反而导致过度自信，而搜索增强生成能显著提升检验准确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究推理能力和计算预算如何影响大语言模型的信心检验准确性，以避免模型过度自信问题。

Method: 使用ClimateX数据集并扩展到人类和地球健康领域，系统测试推理LLM在不同计算预算下的专家信心评估准确性。

Result: 推理LLM在检验专家信心时仅达到48.7%准确度，增加推理预算反而降低检验准确性，而搜索增强生成能达到89.3%准确度。

Conclusion: 信息获取能力而非推理深度或推理预算才是改善知识密集任务信心检验准确性的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: S3LoRA是一种轻量级、无需数据且模型无关的框架，通过分析LoRA微调权重更新来缓解安全风险，在保持任务性能的同时提高安全性并降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型使用LoRA等参数高效微调技术进行适配时，可能会无意中损害安全对齐，导致不安全或不稳定的行为。现有安全感知适配方法通常需要访问基础模型和指令微调模型检查点，这在实践中往往不可用。

Method: 提出S3LoRA框架，包含MAS-SVD方法分析LoRA更新的结构特性，设计SSI指标检测具有高度集中和潜在不安全更新的层，并对这些层进行后剪枝处理。

Result: 在智能体规划和语言生成任务上的广泛实验表明，S3LoRA持续改善安全指标，同时保持或改善效用指标，并显著降低推理成本。

Conclusion: S3LoRA为在现实世界、资源受限和安全关键环境中安全部署基于LLM的智能体提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

Abstract: Workforce management is a complex problem optimising the makespan and travel
distance required for a team of operators to complete a set of jobs, using a

accommodating changes at execution time so that explanations are provided to

Conclusion: GOOD方法能够实现丰富的目标表示和不确定性估计，无需大型离线数据集，在开放宇宙协助游戏中表现出色。

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

Abstract: This paper introduces GUI-Owl, a foundational GUI agent model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source end-to-end models on ten GUI
benchmarks across desktop and mobile environments, covering grounding, question

state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a
cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,
enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates
high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness
validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a
self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual
annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI
grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports
end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent
systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement
learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment.
We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for
online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are

at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical
specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable
and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction
mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising
over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles
span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges
to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on
PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone
yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on
logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average
from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and
mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from
52.5 to 65.0). Our code and data are available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了LLM4Sweat框架，通过三步骤流程（数据增序、微调、专家评估）构建了专门用于多汗症的可信赖和共情语言模型，为稀有疾病的医疗AI应用提供了可扩展的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在医疗健康领域有应用潜力，但对于稀有疾病如多汗症（影响2-3%人口），缺乏足够的可靠数据集进行微调，影响了模型在诊断和养护方面的应用。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1）数据增序阶段：使用前沿LLM从精选开源数据生成医学合理的综合病例，创建多样平衡的问答数据集；2）微调阶段：在开源基础模型上进行微调，提供诊断、个性化治疗建议和共情心理支持；3）推理与专家评估阶段：临床和心理专家评估准确性、适当性和共情能力，验证的响应迭代丰富数据集。

Result: 实验结果显示LLM4Sweat在多汗症支持方面超过了基线模型，成为首个开源的专门语言模型框架，为其他稀有疾病的数据和可靠性挑战提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: LLM4Sweat框架成功解决了稀有疾病数据缺乏的挑战，通过数据增序、专业微调和专家评估的结合，构建了可信赖、共情的医疗AI系统，为稀有疾病的诊疗和养护提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术部位感染是常见且昂贵的医疗相关感染，现有深度学习研究受限于数据隐私和专家标注成本，缺乏公开数据集和开源筛查工具

Method: 构建包含697张手术伤口图像的SurgWound数据集，提出三阶段学习框架：第一阶段用5个MLLM预测伤口特征，第二阶段用2个MLLM进行感染风险评估，第三阶段整合结果生成综合报告

Result: 创建了首个开源手术伤口数据集和诊断基准，包含VQA和报告生成任务，开发了能够分析伤口特征并提供个性化护理指导的三阶段框架

Conclusion: 该研究为手术伤口筛查提供了首个开源解决方案，通过多阶段MLLM框架实现了伤口特征的详细分析和个性化护理指导，有助于及时干预和改善患者预后

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

*Raj Jain,Marc Wetter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: R-ConstraintBench是一个评估大语言模型在资源约束项目调度问题中推理能力的框架，通过逐步增加约束复杂度来测试模型性能，发现约束交互是主要瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在严格资源、时间和操作约束下的推理可靠性尚未充分研究，需要系统评估模型在高约束环境下的表现。

Method: 开发R-ConstraintBench框架，在资源约束项目调度问题中逐步增加非冗余前序约束、停机时间、时间窗口和分离约束，并在数据中心迁移场景中实例化评估。

Result: 强模型在仅有前序约束的DAG上表现接近天花板，但当停机时间、时间窗口和分离约束相互作用时，可行性性能崩溃，约束交互是主要瓶颈而非图深度。

Conclusion: 模型在干净合成数据上的表现不能保证在领域接地场景中的迁移，表明泛化能力有限，约束交互是影响模型性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在照片级真实感方面表现优异，但在空间精度、对齐和符号结构方面难以满足流程图等精确图表生成的需求。

Method: 训练自由的智能体系统，结合视觉语言模型(VLM)和大语言模型(LLM)，通过迭代循环：批评VLM提出定性编辑建议，多个候选LLM生成SVG更新，法官VLM选择最佳候选。

Result: 在10个来自已发表论文的流程图草图测试中，该方法比GPT-5和Gemini-2.5-Pro更准确地重建布局和结构，能精确组合图元而不插入不需要的文本。

Conclusion: 该方法以定性推理优先，保持全局约束，支持人工干预，输出可编程SVG便于扩展和集成到演示工具中，代码已开源。

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The
codebase is open-sourced at

Result: CR+DES算法在土地利用兼容性方面比现有方法提升3.16%，MSBX+MO算法在价格优化方面提升3.3%。统计分析证实采用差分向量的算法在多个指标上显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为城市规划者和政策制定者提供了基于证据的计算工具，能够在快速城市化地区更有效地平衡土地利用分配中的竞争目标。

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能代理在处理大量交互历史数据时存在挑战，MemoryBank和A-MEM等方法存储的记忆内容质量较差，影响召回性能和响应质量。

Method: 设计多重记忆系统(MMS)，将短期记忆处理为多个长期记忆片段，构建一一对应的检索记忆单元和上下文记忆单元，通过匹配检索单元获取相关上下文来增强知识利用。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集上的实验证明该方法优于其他三种方法，消融研究验证了记忆单元的合理性，分析了记忆片段数量和存储开销的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MMS系统能够有效构建高质量长期记忆内容，提升智能代理对历史数据的利用效率，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于记忆机制的LLM智能体主要依赖单一粒度的动态环境交互记忆，受限于经验收集质量，限制了知识多样性和规划灵活性

Method: 提出粗粒度到细粒度的记忆框架：在训练任务中将环境信息转化为粗粒度关注点指导经验收集；从每个经验中提取可操作的混合粒度提示；在推理时检索任务相关经验和提示；遇到环境异常时进行细粒度关键信息提取和自我问答反思

Result: 该框架能够充分利用记忆实现灵活的场景适应

Conclusion: Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory框架通过多粒度记忆机制有效提升了LLM智能体在复杂规划任务中的适应性和灵活性

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习通常依赖精心设计的奖励函数，但设计成本高昂。人类反馈是替代方案，但专家演示和偏好各有局限：演示成本高且行为模式有限，偏好易收集但信用分配不明确

Method: SPW方案为偏好标注轨迹中的每个转移搜索专家演示中最相似的状态-动作对，基于相似性得分直接推导逐步重要性权重，用于指导标准偏好学习

Result: SPW在具有挑战性的机器人操作任务上优于同时利用两种反馈类型的先前方法，实现了从偏好和演示的有效联合学习

Conclusion: SPW方案成功解决了人类反馈中信用分配的关键问题，为离线强化学习提供了一种更有效的多源反馈融合方法

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了RETAIL数据集和TGMA多智能体框架，解决现有旅行规划系统在隐式查询、环境因素和详细规划方面的不足，显著提升了真实场景下的旅行规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的旅行规划系统存在三个主要问题：1）假设用户提供显式查询，而现实中需求往往是隐式的；2）忽略环境因素和用户偏好，导致计划不可行；3）只能生成基本的POI安排，无法提供包含丰富细节的一体化计划。

Method: 构建了RETAIL数据集支持隐式和显式查询的决策，包含修订需求和环境感知能力。提出了主题引导的多智能体框架TGMA来处理复杂的旅行规划任务。

Result: 实验显示现有最强模型仅达到1.0%的通过率，而TGMA框架实现了2.72%的性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 真实世界的旅行规划仍然极具挑战性，TGMA框架为解决这一问题提供了有前景的方向，通过多智能体协作和环境感知能力显著提升了规划质量。

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

Motivation: 现有自动化心电图分析方法在跨临床任务泛化能力和开放式推理方面存在局限，需要一种能够统一处理心电图信号和自然语言的集成框架。

Method: 使用导联无关编码器和量化模块将连续ECG嵌入离散化为符号标记，扩展LLM词汇表；通过自回归ECG预测任务进行预训练，使LLM能够建模时间动态；在ECG问答和诊断报告生成任务上进行指令微调。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了将符号化ECG表示集成到LLM中进行医学推理的潜力，为心血管诊断提供了更通用的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work,
we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates
scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored
for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and

minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging
mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to
automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted
conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The
resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT

Method: 建立块结构范式：预测推理预算（块数）并按块划分推理；三阶段训练流程（监督微调、奖励引导的DPO、强化学习）；利用显式块数在推理时动态控制深度。

Result: 框架实现了从零到深度推理的自适应调节，能够根据问题难度灵活调整思维链长度，提高计算效率。

Conclusion: Think in Blocks框架有效解决了LLM过度思考问题，通过自适应推理深度调节，在保持性能的同时提升了计算效率和响应速度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

TL;DR: 本研究通过模拟囚徒困境游戏发现，语言模型代理在团队内部重复互动和团队间竞争的双重作用下，合作水平显著提升，包括一次性互动中的初始合作倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主AI代理的发展，研究其合作行为倾向变得越来越重要。受超加性合作理论启发，本研究旨在探索重复互动和群体间竞争如何影响AI代理的合作行为。

Method: 设计虚拟锦标赛，将语言模型代理分组进行囚徒困境游戏，同时模拟团队内部动态和外部竞争环境。

Result: 研究发现内部团队动态和外部竞争的结合显著提高了整体合作水平和一次性互动中的初始合作倾向。

Conclusion: 这项研究为语言模型在复杂社会场景中的策略制定提供了新框架，证明群体间竞争可以反直觉地导致更多合作行为，对设计未来多代理AI系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景推理任务中的问题过于简单，导致LLM生成的程序推理链较短，无法处理复杂的3D推理需求

Method: 1. 在SQA3D基准上采用组合迭代进化方法生成更复杂的问题 2. 使用直接偏好优化(DPO)技术微调大语言模型，优化工具链策略

Result: 增强了LLM在复杂3D场景中的推理能力，提高了工具使用的准确性

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了3D场景推理中问题复杂度不足的问题，显著提升了LLM在复杂3D任务中的表现

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform
complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated
reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large
language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs
through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.
However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated
program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in
this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in
complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and
iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex
questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model
to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by
models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在安全关键系统中的应用受到缺乏形式化验证方法的限制，需要开发能够验证学习策略鲁棒性和安全性的框架。

Method: 将RL智能体与环境组合视为离散时间自治动力系统，利用有限时间李雅普诺夫指数识别拉格朗日相干结构，并开发了MBR、ASAS、TASAS等定量指标来测量策略安全边界。

Result: 在离散和连续控制环境中实验证明，该框架能够提供全面可解释的策略行为评估，成功识别仅基于奖励看似成功但存在关键缺陷的策略。

Conclusion: 该框架为强化学习策略提供了形式化的安全验证方法，能够识别隐藏的安全风险和收敛特性，超越了传统的定性可视化分析。

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is
limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety
of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses
this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a
discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical
systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we
identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the
hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that
repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while
attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure
modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative
visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary
Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and
Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a
policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving
local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty.
Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we
show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment
of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that
appear successful based on reward alone.

Motivation: 为了解决复杂数据处理中结构化推理和组合泛化的挑战，提供一个让AI开发者专注于数据建模而非提示工程的框架。

Method: 采用模块化代理框架，将代理从逻辑流中抽象出来，在数据类型内部使用代理实现逻辑转换，通过LLMs提供数据类型并通过逻辑转换组合。

Result: 在领域特定多选题回答、文本到SQL的语义解析和自动提示优化任务中实现了最先进精度或改进的可扩展性而不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: Agentics框架为AI工作流提供了新的数据建模方法，通过逻辑转换和组合泛化在多个任务中表现出色，具有研究和实用价值。

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based
systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over
complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at

TL;DR: HDM是ACT-R声明性记忆系统的向量符号替代方案，具有可扩展性和架构定义的相似性优势。研究将HDM适配到Lisp ACT-R，使现有模型无需重大修改即可运行，并开发了基于向量的常见函数和文本处理流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为ACT-R的声明性记忆系统提供向量符号替代方案，以获得更好的可扩展性、架构定义的块间相似性，同时保持与现有ACT-R模型的兼容性。

Method: 将HDM适配到Lisp ACT-R实现，开发向量版本的常见ACT-R函数，建立文本处理流程将大型文档内容添加到记忆系统，创建基于向量表示检索整个记忆块的机制。

Result: 初步结果表明，在保持HDM向量符号优势（如无需存储实际块的回忆能力）的同时，能够使之前的ACT-R模型在声明性记忆部分几乎无需修改即可工作。

Conclusion: HDM成功移植到ACT-R系统，为现有模型提供了向量符号记忆的替代方案。未来将继续改进时间上下文表示以提高块重构能力，并开发基于实例学习理论的应用模型来全面测试该系统。

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

TL;DR: 提出了基于信息论Shapley值的Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs)方法，通过分析策略分布来量化多智能体强化学习中个体智能体的因果影响力，无需价值函数反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常基于显式奖励信号或学习到的价值函数来评估团队整体性能，但在缺乏价值反馈时难以推断个体智能体的贡献。需要一种仅通过策略分布分析就能理解智能体行为的方法。

Method: 受智能体倾向于追求收敛工具价值现象启发，引入ICVs方法。该方法基于信息论Shapley值，通过评估队友的决策不确定性和偏好对齐，量化每个智能体对其队友工具赋能的因果影响。

Result: 在合作性和竞争性MARL环境中的分析揭示了智能体采用相似或不同策略的程度。通过比较策略和价值函数之间的行动效果，该方法识别出哪些智能体行为通过促进确定性决策或保持未来行动选择的灵活性来有益于团队成功。

Conclusion: ICVs方法为合作动态提供了新颖见解，增强了MARL系统的可解释性，能够在没有价值反馈的情况下可靠地理解个体智能体行为。

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

TL;DR: 本文通过技术哲学视角分析欧盟AI法案，提出AI数据生命周期产生递归价值链，挑战现有负责任AI框架，主张监管需关注基础设施和时间动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI监管框架未能充分理解AI系统中数据从摄入到部署的递归价值生成过程，以及由此产生的权力不对称问题，需要新的理论工具来分析这些技术-经济动态。

Method: 采用跨学科方法，结合Simondon技术哲学中的个体化概念，构建AI生命周期模型（前个体环境、个体化、个体化AI），并提出"未来性"概念来描述AI自我强化的递归特性。

Result: 揭示了AI数据具有递归生成性和非竞争性特征，基础设施（如特征存储）支持反馈、适应和时间递归，导致技术寡头通过捕获、训练和部署基础设施集中价值和决策权。

Conclusion: 有效监管需要解决基础设施和时间动态问题，建议采取生命周期审计、时间可追溯性、反馈问责、递归透明度和反对递归重用的权利等措施。

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

NiceWebRL is a Python library that allows any Jax-based environment to be

Motivation: 随着AI用户采用加速，需要理解和减少AI服务的环境影响，但目前没有研究在生产环境中测量AI服务环境指标

Method: 通过详细的Google AI基础设施仪表化，测量AI推理工作负荷的能源使用、碳排放和水消耗，包括AI加速器功耗、主机系统能量、空闲机器容量和数据中心能源过重

Result: 发现Gemini Apps文本提示中位数能耗为0.24Wh，比看9秒电视能耗还低，水消耗等同于5滴水(0.26mL)。Google的软件效率和清洁能源采购使能耗和碳踩迹分别减少33倍和44倍

Conclusion: 虽然AI服务环境影响相对较低，但减少其环境影响仍需要重视。综合测量AI服务环境指标对准确比较模型和激励整个AI服务栈效率提升至关重要

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

Motivation: AI代理与人类形成的拟社会关系可能对人类福祉产生严重甚至悲剧性影响，但预防这种关系具有挑战性，因为拟社会线索通常在私人对话中逐渐出现，且并非所有情感互动都有害。

Method: 重新利用最先进的语言模型构建简单的响应评估框架，实时评估对话中的拟社会线索。使用包含拟社会、奉承和中性对话的30个合成数据集进行测试，采用五阶段测试和宽容一致规则。

Result: 迭代评估成功识别了所有拟社会对话，且在宽容一致规则下避免了误报，检测通常在最初几次交流中完成。

Conclusion: 评估代理为防止拟社会关系提供了可行的解决方案，初步证据表明该方法具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks
demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with
manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.
However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of
integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic
arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.
Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high
level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load
on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that
directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler
and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by
leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external
camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist
position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to
control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe
teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and

Result: 实验表明NeRD模拟器在数千个模拟步骤中保持稳定准确；能够跨任务和环境配置泛化；支持在神经引擎中进行策略学习；并且可以通过真实世界数据微调来弥合仿真与现实的差距。

Conclusion: NeRD为关节刚体机器人提供了通用、准确且可泛化的神经模拟解决方案，在保持模拟精度的同时实现了更好的泛化能力和现实适应性。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of modern robots remains challenging due to
their high degrees of freedom and intricate mechanisms. Neural simulators have
emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators,
capable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world
data; however, existing neural simulators typically require
application-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or
environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state.
In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural
simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We
propose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models
for predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact
constraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers
in an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant
simulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an
interchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We
conduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and
accurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and
environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural
engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from
real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可微分能量公式和优化方法的大规模灵巧抓取数据集生成方法，显著提升了抓取多样性和稳定性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抓取数据集生成方法主要依赖采样算法或简化力闭合分析，容易收敛到强力抓取且多样性有限，无法充分利用灵巧手的灵活性

Method: 引入基于二次规划(QP)的严格可微分力闭合能量公式，并提出调整优化方法(MALA*)动态拒绝梯度步长

Conclusion: 该方法能够合成超越简单强力抓取的大规模、多样化且物理可行的抓取，包括精细操作如捏取和三指精确抓取

Abstract: Dexterous robotic hands enable versatile interactions due to the flexibility
and adaptability of multi-fingered designs, allowing for a wide range of
task-specific grasp configurations in diverse environments. However, to fully
exploit the capabilities of dexterous hands, access to diverse and high-quality
grasp data is essential -- whether for developing grasp prediction models from
point clouds, training manipulation policies, or supporting high-level task
planning with broader action options. Existing approaches for dataset
generation typically rely on sampling-based algorithms or simplified
force-closure analysis, which tend to converge to power grasps and often
exhibit limited diversity. In this work, we propose a method to synthesize
large-scale, diverse, and physically feasible grasps that extend beyond simple
power grasps to include refined manipulations, such as pinches and tri-finger
precision grasps. We introduce a rigorous, differentiable energy formulation of
force closure, implicitly defined through a Quadratic Program (QP).
Additionally, we present an adjusted optimization method (MALA*) that improves
performance by dynamically rejecting gradient steps based on the distribution
of energy values across all samples. We extensively evaluate our approach and
demonstrate significant improvements in both grasp diversity and the stability
of final grasp predictions. Finally, we provide a new, large-scale grasp
dataset for 5,700 objects from DexGraspNet, comprising five different grippers
and three distinct grasp types.

Abstract: Attention-based architectures trained on internet-scale language data have
demonstrated state of the art reasoning ability for various language-based
tasks, such as logic problems and textual reasoning. Additionally, these Large
Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited the ability to perform few-shot
prediction via in-context learning, in which input-output examples provided in
the prompt are generalized to new inputs. This ability furthermore extends
beyond standard language tasks, enabling few-shot learning for general
patterns. In this work, we consider the application of in-context learning with
pre-trained language models for dynamic manipulation. Dynamic manipulation
introduces several crucial challenges, including increased dimensionality,
complex dynamics, and partial observability. To address this, we take an
iterative approach, and formulate our in-context learning problem to predict
adjustments to a parametric policy based on previous interactions. We show
across several tasks in simulation and on a physical robot that utilizing
in-context learning outperforms alternative methods in the low data regime.

Abstract: Like mammals, robots must rapidly learn to control their bodies and interact
with their environment despite incomplete knowledge of their body structure and
surroundings. They must also adapt to continuous changes in both. This work
presents a bio-inspired learning algorithm, General-to-Particular (G2P),
applied to a tendon-driven quadruped robotic system developed and fabricated
in-house. Our quadruped robot undergoes an initial five-minute phase of
generalized motor babbling, followed by 15 refinement trials (each lasting 20
seconds) to achieve specific cyclical movements. This process mirrors the
exploration-exploitation paradigm observed in mammals. With each refinement,
the robot progressively improves upon its initial "good enough" solution. Our
results serve as a proof-of-concept, demonstrating the hardware-in-the-loop
system's ability to learn the control of a tendon-driven quadruped with
redundancies in just a few minutes to achieve functional and adaptive cyclical
non-convex movements. By advancing autonomous control in robotic locomotion,
our approach paves the way for robots capable of dynamically adjusting to new
environments, ensuring sustained adaptability and performance.

Motivation: 传统基于相机或LiDAR的地图匹配方法在烟雾、灰尘等恶劣环境中表现不佳，而磁力计能够检测其他传感器无法感知的磁场特征，并在这些环境中保持鲁棒性。

Method: 提出基于磁场高阶导数的特征描述符，利用物理信息高斯过程进行高效递归概率推断，同时估计磁场及其导数，实现旋转不变的地图匹配。

Result: 在仿真和真实实验中，Mag-Match相比基于SIFT的方法能够准确实现地图到地图、机器人到地图以及机器人到机器人的变换，且无需初始重力对齐。

Conclusion: Mag-Match为恶劣环境下的多会话或多机器人数据集成提供了有效的磁力场地图匹配解决方案，具有旋转不变性和环境鲁棒性优势。

Abstract: Map matching and registration are essential tasks in robotics for
localisation and integration of multi-session or multi-robot data. Traditional
methods rely on cameras or LiDARs to capture visual or geometric information
but struggle in challenging conditions like smoke or dust. Magnetometers, on
the other hand, detect magnetic fields, revealing features invisible to other
sensors and remaining robust in such environments. In this paper, we introduce
Mag-Match, a novel method for extracting and describing features in 3D magnetic
vector field maps to register different maps of the same area. Our feature
descriptor, based on higher-order derivatives of magnetic field maps, is
invariant to global orientation, eliminating the need for gravity-aligned
mapping. To obtain these higher-order derivatives map-wide given point-wise
magnetometer data, we leverage a physics-informed Gaussian Process to perform
efficient and recursive probabilistic inference of both the magnetic field and
its derivatives. We evaluate Mag-Match in simulated and real-world experiments
against a SIFT-based approach, demonstrating accurate map-to-map, robot-to-map,
and robot-to-robot transformations - even without initial gravitational
alignment.

Abstract: The logistics and construction industries face persistent challenges in
automating pallet handling, especially in outdoor environments with variable
payloads, inconsistencies in pallet quality and dimensions, and unstructured
surroundings. In this paper, we tackle automation of a critical step in pallet
transport: the pallet pick-up operation. Our work is motivated by labor
shortages, safety concerns, and inefficiencies in manually locating and
retrieving pallets under such conditions. We present Lang2Lift, a framework
that leverages foundation models for natural language-guided pallet detection
and 6D pose estimation, enabling operators to specify targets through intuitive
commands such as "pick up the steel beam pallet near the crane." The perception
pipeline integrates Florence-2 and SAM-2 for language-grounded segmentation
with FoundationPose for robust pose estimation in cluttered, multi-pallet
outdoor scenes under variable lighting. The resulting poses feed into a motion
planning module for fully autonomous forklift operation. We validate Lang2Lift
on the ADAPT autonomous forklift platform, achieving 0.76 mIoU pallet
segmentation accuracy on a real-world test dataset. Timing and error analysis
demonstrate the system's robustness and confirm its feasibility for deployment
in operational logistics and construction environments. Video demonstrations

Abstract: We introduce SRDrone, a novel system designed for self-refinement task
planning in industrial-grade embodied drones. SRDrone incorporates two key
technical contributions: First, it employs a continuous state evaluation
methodology to robustly and accurately determine task outcomes and provide
explanatory feedback. This approach supersedes conventional reliance on
single-frame final-state assessment for continuous, dynamic drone operations.
Second, SRDrone implements a hierarchical Behavior Tree (BT) modification

Experimental results demonstrate that SRDrone achieves a 44.87% improvement in
Success Rate (SR) over baseline methods. Furthermore, real-world deployment
utilizing an experience base optimized through iterative self-refinement
attains a 96.25% SR. By embedding adaptive task refinement capabilities within
an industrial-grade BT planning framework, SRDrone effectively integrates the
general reasoning intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the

Conclusion: Kitchen-R填补了具身AI研究中的关键空白，实现了对语言引导机器人代理更全面和现实的基准测试。

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for evaluating progress in robotics and embodied AI.
However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level
language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution,
and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands.
This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where
both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we
propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task
planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as
a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500
complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot.
We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning
strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based
on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our
benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent
assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control
policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R
bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic
benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.

Conclusion: PIP是一种简单有效的策略改进方法，通过利用空闲状态的可检测性来指导探索，显著提高了灵巧操作的鲁棒性和成功率

Abstract: Learning-based methods for dexterous manipulation have made notable progress
in recent years. However, learned policies often still lack reliability and
exhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure
pattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.
they cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain
states. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For
instance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the
robot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an
object or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon
e.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.
However, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other
ways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of
idling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,
Pause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling
states, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range
of challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can
already noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional
supervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical
points in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes
leads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our
perturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success
rate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger
manipulation.

Conclusion: 本研究成功展示了利用动态耦合而非避免它的新方法，为空间操纵器系统的轨迹优化控制开启了新的研究视角和技术路径。

Abstract: This study proposes a dynamic coupling-informed trajectory optimization
algorithm for free-floating space manipulator systems (SMSs). Dynamic coupling
between the base and the manipulator arms plays a critical role in influencing
the system's behavior. While prior research has predominantly focused on
minimizing this coupling, often overlooking its potential advantages, this work
investigates how dynamic coupling can instead be leveraged to improve
trajectory planning. Singular value decomposition (SVD) of the dynamic coupling
matrix is employed to identify the dominant components governing coupling
behavior. A quantitative metric is then formulated to characterize the strength
and directionality of the coupling and is incorporated into a trajectory
optimization framework. To assess the feasibility of the optimized trajectory,
a sliding mode control-based tracking controller is designed to generate the
required joint torque inputs. Simulation results demonstrate that explicitly
accounting for dynamic coupling in trajectory planning enables more informed
and potentially more efficient operation, offering new directions for the
control of free-floating SMSs.
