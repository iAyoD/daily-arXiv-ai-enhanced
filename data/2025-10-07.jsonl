Traditional controller synthesis typically yields a single\ndeterministic strategy, limiting adaptability.

While recent advances in general motion\ntracking (GMT) have enabled humanoids to reproduce diverse human motions, these\npolicies lack the precision and object awareness required for\nloco-manipulation. To this end, we introduce ResMimic, a two-stage residual\nlearning framework for precise and expressive humanoid control from human\nmotion data. First, a GMT policy, trained on large-scale human-only motion,\nserves as a task-agnostic base for generating human-like whole-body movements.\nAn efficient but precise residual policy is then learned to refine the GMT\noutputs to improve locomotion and incorporate object interaction. To further\nfacilitate efficient training, we design (i) a point-cloud-based object\ntracking reward for smoother optimization, (ii) a contact reward that\nencourages accurate humanoid body-object interactions, and (iii) a\ncurriculum-based virtual object controller to stabilize early training. We\nevaluate ResMimic in both simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid. Results\nshow substantial gains in task success, training efficiency, and robustness\nover strong baselines.
