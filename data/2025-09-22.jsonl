Our objective is to accurately predict the\nimpact point, defined as the object's landing position. This task poses two key\nchallenges: the absence of public datasets capturing diverse objects under\nunsteady aerodynamics, which are essential for training reliable predictors;\nand the difficulty of accurate early-stage impact point prediction when\ntrajectories appear similar across objects. To overcome these issues, we\nconstruct a real-world dataset of 8,000 trajectories from 20 objects, providing\na foundation for advancing in-flight object catching under complex\naerodynamics. We then propose the Discriminative Impact Point Predictor (DIPP),\nconsisting of two modules: (i) a Discriminative Feature Embedding (DFE) that\nseparates trajectories by dynamics to enable early-stage discrimination and\ngeneralization, and (ii) an Impact Point Predictor (IPP) that estimates the\nimpact point from these features. Two IPP variants are implemented: an Neural\nAcceleration Estimator (NAE)-based method that predicts trajectories and\nderives the impact point, and a Direct Point Estimator (DPE)-based method that\ndirectly outputs it. Experimental results show that our dataset is more diverse\nand complex than existing dataset, and that our method outperforms baselines on\nboth 15 seen and 5 unseen objects. Furthermore, we show that improved\nearly-stage prediction enhances catching success in simulation and demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach through real-world experiments.

While game-theoretic models capture how AVs influence HVs, they often\nsuffer from a long-term decay of influence and can be perceived as\nmanipulative, eroding the human's trust. This can paradoxically lead to riskier\nhuman driving behavior over repeated interactions. In this paper, we address\nthis challenge by proposing the Trust-Aware Embodied Bayesian Persuasion\n(TA-EBP) framework. Our work makes three key contributions: First, we apply\nBayesian persuasion to model communication at traffic intersections, offering a\ntransparent alternative to traditional game-theoretic models. Second, we\nintroduce a trust parameter to the persuasion framework, deriving a theorem for\nthe minimum trust level required for influence. Finally, we ground the abstract\nsignals of Bayesian persuasion theory into a continuous, physically meaningful\naction space, deriving a second theorem for the optimal signal magnitude,\nrealized as an AV's forward nudge. Additionally, we validate our framework in a\nmixed-autonomy traffic simulation, demonstrating that TA-EBP successfully\npersuades HVs to drive more cautiously, eliminating collisions and improving\ntraffic flow compared to baselines that either ignore trust or lack\ncommunication. Our work provides a transparent and non-strategic framework for\ninfluence in human-robot interaction, enhancing both safety and efficiency."}

However,\nthis goal is hindered by significant challenges, particularly in effectively\nprocessing complex observation, achieving robust generalization, and generating\ncoherent actions. To address these issues, we propose DSPv2, a novel policy\narchitecture. DSPv2 introduces an effective encoding scheme that aligns 3D\nspatial features with multi-view 2D semantic features. This fusion enables the\npolicy to achieve broad generalization while retaining the fine-grained\nperception necessary for precise control. Furthermore, we extend the Dense\nPolicy paradigm to the whole-body mobile manipulation domain, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in generating coherent and precise actions for the whole-body\nrobotic platform. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly\noutperforms existing approaches in both task performance and generalization\nability.

Although recent advances in\nvision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved the spatial reasoning\nand task-planning capabilities of robots, they remain limited in their ability\nto recognize their own failures. In particular, a critical yet underexplored\nchallenge lies in detecting semantic misalignment errors, where the robot\nexecutes a task that is semantically meaningful but inconsistent with the given\ninstruction. To address this, we propose a method for building datasets\ntargeting Semantic Misalignment Failures detection, from existing\nlanguage-conditioned manipulation datasets. We also present I-FailSense, an\nopen-source VLM framework with grounded arbitration designed specifically for\nfailure detection. Our approach relies on post-training a base VLM, followed by\ntraining lightweight classification heads, called FS blocks, attached to\ndifferent internal layers of the VLM and whose predictions are aggregated using\nan ensembling mechanism. Experiments show that I-FailSense outperforms\nstate-of-the-art VLMs, both comparable in size and larger, in detecting\nsemantic misalignment errors. Notably, despite being trained only on semantic\nmisalignment detection, I-FailSense generalizes to broader robotic failure\ncategories and effectively transfers to other simulation environments and\nreal-world with zero-shot or minimal post-training. The datasets and models are\npublicly released on HuggingFace (Webpage:\nhttps://clemgris.github.io/I-FailSense/)."}

A key challenge when using\narm-mounted sensors is differentiating between the robot itself and external\nobjects in sensor measurements. To address this challenge, we propose a\ncomputationally lightweight method which utilizes the raw time-of-flight\ninformation captured by many off-the-shelf, low-resolution time-of-flight\nsensor. We build an empirical model of expected sensor measurements in the\npresence of the robot alone, and use this model at runtime to detect objects in\nproximity to the robot. In addition to avoiding robot self-detections in common\nsensor configurations, the proposed method enables extra flexibility in sensor\nplacement, unlocking configurations which achieve more efficient coverage of a\nradius around the robot arm. Our method can detect small objects near the arm\nand localize the position of objects along the length of a robot link to\nreasonable precision. We evaluate the performance of the method with respect to\nobject type, location, and ambient light level, and identify limiting factors\non performance inherent in the measurement principle. The proposed method has\npotential applications in collision avoidance and in facilitating safe\nhuman-robot interaction."}

Recent advances leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for\nautomated reward design, but these approaches are limited by hallucinations,\nreliance on human feedback, and challenges with handling complex, multi-step\ntasks. In this work, we introduce Reward Evolution with Graph-of-Thoughts\n(RE-GoT), a novel bi-level framework that enhances LLMs with structured\ngraph-based reasoning and integrates Visual Language Models (VLMs) for\nautomated rollout evaluation. RE-GoT first decomposes tasks into\ntext-attributed graphs, enabling comprehensive analysis and reward function\ngeneration, and then iteratively refines rewards using visual feedback from\nVLMs without human intervention. Extensive experiments on 10 RoboGen and 4\nManiSkill2 tasks demonstrate that RE-GoT consistently outperforms existing\nLLM-based baselines. On RoboGen, our method improves average task success rates\nby 32.25%, with notable gains on complex multi-step tasks. On ManiSkill2,\nRE-GoT achieves an average success rate of 93.73% across four diverse\nmanipulation tasks, significantly surpassing prior LLM-based approaches and\neven exceeding expert-designed rewards. Our results indicate that combining\nLLMs and VLMs with graph-of-thoughts reasoning provides a scalable and\neffective solution for autonomous reward evolution in RL."}

In this letter, we present a full-body dynamics model for fish\nswimming, rigorously derived from Hamilton's principle. The model captures the\ncontinuously distributed elasticity of a deformable fish body undergoing large\ndeformations and incorporates fluid-structure coupling effects, enabling\nself-propelled motion without prescribing kinematics. A preliminary parameter\nstudy explores the influence of actuation frequency and body stiffness on\nswimming speed and cost of transport (COT). Simulation results indicate that\nswimming speed and energy efficiency exhibit opposing trends with tail-beat\nfrequency and that both body stiffness and body length have distinct optimal\nvalues. These findings provide insights into biological swimming mechanisms and\ninform the design of high-performance soft robotic swimmers."}
