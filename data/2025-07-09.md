### [1] [Structured Captions Improve Prompt Adherence in Text-to-Image Models (Re-LAION-Caption 19M)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05300)
*Nicholas Merchant,Haitz Sáez de Ocáriz Borde,Andrei Cristian Popescu,Carlos Garcia Jurado Suarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出通过结构化标注提升生成模型的提示遵从性，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式文本到图像模型因大规模数据集的噪声和无结构问题，导致提示遵从性差，用户需依赖提示工程。

Method: 提出Re-LAION-Caption 19M数据集，采用四部分结构化标注模板，并在PixArt-Σ和Stable Diffusion 2上微调。

Result: 结构化标注版本在视觉问答（VQA）模型中表现更高的文本-图像对齐分数。

Conclusion: 结构化标注显著提升模型可控性和对齐性，数据集已公开。

Abstract: We argue that generative text-to-image models often struggle with prompt
adherence due to the noisy and unstructured nature of large-scale datasets like
LAION-5B. This forces users to rely heavily on prompt engineering to elicit
desirable outputs. In this work, we propose that enforcing a consistent caption
structure during training can significantly improve model controllability and
alignment. We introduce Re-LAION-Caption 19M, a high-quality subset of
Re-LAION-5B, comprising 19 million 1024x1024 images with captions generated by
a Mistral 7B Instruct-based LLaVA-Next model. Each caption follows a four-part
template: subject, setting, aesthetics, and camera details. We fine-tune
PixArt-$\Sigma$ and Stable Diffusion 2 using both structured and randomly
shuffled captions, and show that structured versions consistently yield higher
text-image alignment scores using visual question answering (VQA) models. The
dataset is publicly available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/supermodelresearch/Re-LAION-Caption19M.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CorrDetail的视觉细节增强自校正框架，用于可解释的人脸伪造检测，通过错误引导问题和视觉细粒度细节增强模块提升检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成技术的快速发展，人脸深度伪造对安全领域构成重大挑战，现有检测方法存在解释性不足和幻觉问题。

Method: 设计了CorrDetail框架，结合错误引导问题和视觉细粒度细节增强模块，通过融合决策策略提升模型判别能力。

Result: 实验表明，CorrDetail在性能上优于最新方法，能准确识别伪造细节并具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: CorrDetail为解决深度伪造检测中的解释性和幻觉问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: With the swift progression of image generation technology, the widespread
emergence of facial deepfakes poses significant challenges to the field of
security, thus amplifying the urgent need for effective deepfake
detection.Existing techniques for face forgery detection can broadly be
categorized into two primary groups: visual-based methods and multimodal
approaches. The former often lacks clear explanations for forgery details,
while the latter, which merges visual and linguistic modalities, is more prone
to the issue of hallucinations.To address these shortcomings, we introduce a
visual detail enhanced self-correction framework, designated CorrDetail, for
interpretable face forgery detection. CorrDetail is meticulously designed to
rectify authentic forgery details when provided with error-guided questioning,
with the aim of fostering the ability to uncover forgery details rather than
yielding hallucinated responses. Additionally, to bolster the reliability of
its findings, a visual fine-grained detail enhancement module is incorporated,
supplying CorrDetail with more precise visual forgery details. Ultimately, a
fusion decision strategy is devised to further augment the model's
discriminative capacity in handling extreme samples, through the integration of
visual information compensation and model bias reduction.Experimental results
demonstrate that CorrDetail not only achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to the latest methodologies but also excels in accurately identifying
forged details, all while exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在几何复杂道路（如Type-S曲面）上RGB相机行人检测的局限性，提升自动驾驶感知系统的鲁棒性。

Method: 引入YOLO-APD架构，包含SimAM注意力机制、C3Ghost模块、SimSPPF模块、Mish激活函数和IGD模块，结合车辆转向动态进行自适应区域处理。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception systems require robust pedestrian detection,
particularly on geometrically complex roadways like Type-S curved surfaces,
where standard RGB camera-based methods face limitations. This paper introduces
YOLO-APD, a novel deep learning architecture enhancing the YOLOv8 framework
specifically for this challenge. YOLO-APD integrates several key architectural
modifications: a parameter-free SimAM attention mechanism, computationally
efficient C3Ghost modules, a novel SimSPPF module for enhanced multi-scale
feature pooling, the Mish activation function for improved optimization, and an
Intelligent Gather & Distribute (IGD) module for superior feature fusion in the
network's neck. The concept of leveraging vehicle steering dynamics for
adaptive region-of-interest processing is also presented. Comprehensive
evaluations on a custom CARLA dataset simulating complex scenarios demonstrate
that YOLO-APD achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy, reaching 77.7%
mAP@0.5:0.95 and exceptional pedestrian recall exceeding 96%, significantly
outperforming baseline models, including YOLOv8. Furthermore, it maintains
real-time processing capabilities at 100 FPS, showcasing a superior balance
between accuracy and efficiency. Ablation studies validate the synergistic
contribution of each integrated component. Evaluation on the KITTI dataset
confirms the architecture's potential while highlighting the need for domain
adaptation. This research advances the development of highly accurate,
efficient, and adaptable perception systems based on cost-effective sensors,
contributing to enhanced safety and reliability for autonomous navigation in
challenging, less-structured driving environments.

### [4] [Foreground-aware Virtual Staining for Accurate 3D Cell Morphological Profiling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05383)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spotlight是一种虚拟染色方法，通过机器学习预测无标记输入的荧光图像，专注于生物相关信号而非背景噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟染色方法通常对所有像素平等处理，导致背景噪声和伪影被复制，而非聚焦于生物意义信号。

Method: Spotlight使用基于直方图的前景估计来掩蔽像素级损失，并通过软阈值预测计算Dice损失以实现形状感知学习。

Result: 在3D基准数据集上，Spotlight改善了形态表示，同时保持像素级精度，生成的虚拟染色更适合下游任务。

Conclusion: Spotlight提供了一种简单而强大的虚拟染色方法，优化了生物结构的表示，适用于后续分析任务。

Abstract: Microscopy enables direct observation of cellular morphology in 3D, with
transmitted-light methods offering low-cost, minimally invasive imaging and
fluorescence microscopy providing specificity and contrast. Virtual staining
combines these strengths by using machine learning to predict fluorescence
images from label-free inputs. However, training of existing methods typically
relies on loss functions that treat all pixels equally, thus reproducing
background noise and artifacts instead of focusing on biologically meaningful
signals. We introduce Spotlight, a simple yet powerful virtual staining
approach that guides the model to focus on relevant cellular structures.
Spotlight uses histogram-based foreground estimation to mask pixel-wise loss
and to calculate a Dice loss on soft-thresholded predictions for shape-aware
learning. Applied to a 3D benchmark dataset, Spotlight improves morphological
representation while preserving pixel-level accuracy, resulting in virtual
stains better suited for downstream tasks such as segmentation and profiling.

Conclusion: 论文呼吁开发专门针对农业的基础模型，以更好地满足农业监测和管理的需求。

Abstract: Food security remains a global concern as population grows and climate change
intensifies, demanding innovative solutions for sustainable agricultural
productivity. Recent advances in foundation models have demonstrated remarkable
performance in remote sensing and climate sciences, and therefore offer new
opportunities for agricultural monitoring. However, their application in
challenges related to agriculture-such as crop type mapping, crop phenology
estimation, and crop yield estimation-remains under-explored. In this work, we
quantitatively evaluate existing foundational models to assess their
effectivity for a representative set of agricultural tasks. From an
agricultural domain perspective, we describe a requirements framework for an
ideal agricultural foundation model (CropFM). We then survey and compare
existing general-purpose foundational models in this framework and empirically
evaluate two exemplary of them in three representative agriculture specific
tasks. Finally, we highlight the need for a dedicated foundational model
tailored specifically to agriculture.

### [6] [Enhancing Underwater Images Using Deep Learning with Subjective Image Quality Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05393)
*Jose M. Montero,Jose-Luis Lisani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的改进水下图像质量的方法，通过结合人类主观评估训练生成对抗网络（GANs），显著提升了图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在图像增强领域的应用日益广泛，但水下图像质量的自动提升仍面临挑战。本文旨在通过结合人类主观评估，改进水下图像增强的效果。

Method: 首先训练分类器网络区分高、低质量水下图像，随后利用多种增强标准训练GANs优化低质量图像。

Result: 实验表明，结合颜色保真度和图像锐度等标准后，模型在感知和定量指标（PSNR、SSIM、UIQM）上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合人类主观评估和深度学习，有效提升了水下图像质量，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning, particularly neural networks, have
significantly impacted a wide range of fields, including the automatic
enhancement of underwater images. This paper presents a deep learning-based
approach to improving underwater image quality by integrating human subjective
assessments into the training process. To this end, we utilize publicly
available datasets containing underwater images labeled by experts as either
high or low quality. Our method involves first training a classifier network to
distinguish between high- and low-quality images. Subsequently, generative
adversarial networks (GANs) are trained using various enhancement criteria to
refine the low-quality images. The performance of the GAN models is evaluated
using quantitative metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and UIQM, as well as through
qualitative analysis. Results demonstrate that the proposed model --
particularly when incorporating criteria such as color fidelity and image
sharpness -- achieves substantial improvements in both perceived and measured
image quality.

### [7] [pFedMMA: Personalized Federated Fine-Tuning with Multi-Modal Adapter for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05394)
*Sajjad Ghiasvand,Mahnoosh Alizadeh,Ramtin Pedarsani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: pFedMMA是一种个性化联邦学习框架，利用多模态适配器优化视觉语言任务，平衡个性化和泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在个性化联邦学习中牺牲泛化能力的问题，特别是在未见类别或领域上表现不佳。

Method: 采用多模态适配器，包含模态特定的上下投影层和全局共享投影层，通过非对称优化策略实现本地个性化与全局泛化的平衡。

Result: 在11个数据集上的实验表明，pFedMMA在个性化和泛化之间取得了最佳平衡，优于现有联邦提示调优方法。

Conclusion: pFedMMA为视觉语言任务提供了一种高效、通信友好的个性化联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable
generalization in zero- and few-shot settings, but adapting them efficiently to
decentralized, heterogeneous data remains a challenge. While prompt tuning has
emerged as a popular parameter-efficient approach in personalized federated
learning, existing methods often sacrifice generalization in favor of
personalization, struggling particularly on unseen classes or domains. In this
work, we propose pFedMMA, the first personalized federated learning framework
that leverages multi-modal adapters for vision-language tasks. Each adapter
contains modality-specific up- and down-projection layers alongside a globally
shared projection that aligns cross-modal features. Our asymmetric optimization
strategy allows clients to locally adapt to personalized data distributions
while collaboratively training the shared projection to improve global
generalization. This design is also communication-efficient, as only the shared
component is exchanged during rounds. Through extensive experiments across
eleven datasets, including domain- and label-shift scenarios, we show that
pFedMMA achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between personalization and
generalization, outperforming recent federated prompt tuning methods. The code
is available at https://github.com/sajjad-ucsb/pFedMMA.

TL;DR: LoongX是一种基于多模态神经生理信号的无手图像编辑方法，结合了脑机接口和生成模型，性能接近文本驱动方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像编辑依赖手动提示，对运动或语言能力受限的用户不友好，因此提出一种基于神经信号的替代方案。

Method: 利用扩散模型和多模态神经信号（EEG、fNIRS、PPG等），通过CS3模块和DGF模块处理信号异质性，并结合对比学习预训练编码器。

Result: LoongX在性能上接近文本驱动方法（如CLIP-I和DINO），并在结合语音时表现更优。

Conclusion: 神经驱动的生成模型为无障碍图像编辑提供了新方向，推动了认知驱动技术的发展。

Abstract: Traditional image editing typically relies on manual prompting, making it
labor-intensive and inaccessible to individuals with limited motor control or
language abilities. Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing
approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes
state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928
image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography
(EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography
(PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address
the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The
cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific
features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these
features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics
via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train
the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic
intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I:
0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural
signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549). These results
highlight the promise of neural-driven generative models in enabling
accessible, intuitive image editing and open new directions for
cognitive-driven creative technologies. Datasets and code will be released to
support future work and foster progress in this emerging area.

Abstract: Motion generation, the task of synthesizing realistic motion sequences from
various conditioning inputs, has become a central problem in computer vision,
computer graphics, and robotics, with applications ranging from animation and
virtual agents to human-robot interaction. As the field has rapidly progressed
with the introduction of diverse modeling paradigms including GANs,
autoencoders, autoregressive models, and diffusion-based techniques, each
approach brings its own advantages and limitations. This growing diversity has
created a need for a comprehensive and structured review that specifically
examines recent developments from the perspective of the generative approach
employed.
  In this survey, we provide an in-depth categorization of motion generation
methods based on their underlying generative strategies. Our main focus is on
papers published in top-tier venues since 2023, reflecting the most recent
advancements in the field. In addition, we analyze architectural principles,
conditioning mechanisms, and generation settings, and compile a detailed
overview of the evaluation metrics and datasets used across the literature. Our
objective is to enable clearer comparisons and identify open challenges,
thereby offering a timely and foundational reference for researchers and
practitioners navigating the rapidly evolving landscape of motion generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合2D扩散编辑和逆渲染的方法，用于3D高斯溅射（3DGS）场景的局部编辑，解决了3D语义解析性能不足的问题，实现了高效且一致的编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D语义解析在局部编辑中表现不佳，限制了3D场景编辑的精确性和一致性，需要一种更有效的方法来提升编辑质量。

Method: 利用2D扩散编辑识别修改区域，通过逆渲染进行3D定位，结合深度图预测和迭代优化，逐步增强结构和纹理一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在性能上达到最优，同时实现了4倍的速度提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D场景局部编辑提供了一种高效且一致的解决方案，显著提升了编辑质量和效率。

Abstract: Many 3D scene editing tasks focus on modifying local regions rather than the
entire scene, except for some global applications like style transfer, and in
the context of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), where scenes are represented by a
series of Gaussians, this structure allows for precise regional edits, offering
enhanced control over specific areas of the scene; however, the challenge lies
in the fact that 3D semantic parsing often underperforms compared to its 2D
counterpart, making targeted manipulations within 3D spaces more difficult and
limiting the fidelity of edits, which we address by leveraging 2D diffusion
editing to accurately identify modification regions in each view, followed by
inverse rendering for 3D localization, then refining the frontal view and
initializing a coarse 3DGS with consistent views and approximate shapes derived
from depth maps predicted by a 2D foundation model, thereby supporting an
iterative, view-consistent editing process that gradually enhances structural
details and textures to ensure coherence across perspectives. Experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering up to a $4\times$ speedup, providing a more efficient and effective
approach to 3D scene local editing.

Abstract: The ability to segment objects based on open-ended language prompts remains a
critical challenge, requiring models to ground textual semantics into precise
spatial masks while handling diverse and unseen categories. We present
OpenWorldSAM, a framework that extends the prompt-driven Segment Anything Model
v2 (SAM2) to open-vocabulary scenarios by integrating multi-modal embeddings
extracted from a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). Our approach is
guided by four key principles: i) Unified prompting: OpenWorldSAM supports a
diverse range of prompts, including category-level and sentence-level language
descriptions, providing a flexible interface for various segmentation tasks.
ii) Efficiency: By freezing the pre-trained components of SAM2 and the VLM, we
train only 4.5 million parameters on the COCO-stuff dataset, achieving
remarkable resource efficiency. iii) Instance Awareness: We enhance the model's
spatial understanding through novel positional tie-breaker embeddings and
cross-attention layers, enabling effective segmentation of multiple instances.
iv) Generalization: OpenWorldSAM exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities,
generalizing well on unseen categories and an open vocabulary of concepts
without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
OpenWorldSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic,
instance, and panoptic segmentation across multiple benchmarks, including
ADE20k, PASCAL, ScanNet, and SUN-RGBD.

Abstract: Uniform and excessive herbicide application in modern agriculture contributes
to increased input costs, environmental pollution, and the emergence of
herbicide resistant weeds. To address these challenges, we developed a vision
guided, AI-driven variable rate sprayer system capable of detecting weed
presence, estimating canopy size, and dynamically adjusting nozzle activation
in real time. The system integrates lightweight YOLO11n and YOLO11n-seg deep
learning models, deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano for onboard inference,
and uses an Arduino Uno-based relay interface to control solenoid actuated
nozzles based on canopy segmentation results. Indoor trials were conducted
using 15 potted Hibiscus rosa sinensis plants of varying canopy sizes to
simulate a range of weed patch scenarios. The YOLO11n model achieved a mean
average precision (mAP@50) of 0.98, with a precision of 0.99 and a recall close
to 1.0. The YOLO11n-seg segmentation model achieved a mAP@50 of 0.48, precision
of 0.55, and recall of 0.52. System performance was validated using water
sensitive paper, which showed an average spray coverage of 24.22% in zones
where canopy was present. An upward trend in mean spray coverage from 16.22%
for small canopies to 21.46% and 21.65% for medium and large canopies,
respectively, demonstrated the system's capability to adjust spray output based
on canopy size in real time. These results highlight the potential of combining
real time deep learning with low-cost embedded hardware for selective herbicide
application. Future work will focus on expanding the detection capabilities to
include three common weed species in South Dakota: water hemp (Amaranthus
tuberculatus), kochia (Bassia scoparia), and foxtail (Setaria spp.), followed
by further validation in both indoor and field trials within soybean and corn
production systems.

Motivation: 当前诊断认知衰退（如阿尔茨海默病和轻度认知障碍）的方法耗时且昂贵，导致漏诊率高。通过分析真实驾驶行为，提取与认知衰退相关的“数字指纹”。

Method: 提出一个框架，结合大视觉模型和自然驾驶视频，分析驾驶员行为，分类认知状态并预测疾病进展。

Conclusion: 该研究有助于早期检测认知衰退，开发可扩展、非侵入的监测系统，减轻老龄化社会中认知衰退的社会和经济负担。

Abstract: We introduce scenario-based cognitive status identification in older drivers
from Naturalistic driving videos and large vision models. In recent times,
cognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), is often underdiagnosed due to the time-consuming and costly
nature of current diagnostic methods. By analyzing real-world driving behavior
captured through in-vehicle systems, this research aims to extract "digital
fingerprints" that correlate with functional decline and clinical features of
MCI and AD. Moreover, modern large vision models can draw meaningful insights
from everyday driving patterns of older patients to early detect cognitive
decline. We propose a framework that uses large vision models and naturalistic
driving videos to analyze driver behavior, classify cognitive status and
predict disease progression. We leverage the strong relationship between
real-world driving behavior as an observation of the current cognitive status
of the drivers where the vehicle can be utilized as a "diagnostic tool". Our
method identifies early warning signs of functional impairment, contributing to
proactive intervention strategies. This work enhances early detection and
supports the development of scalable, non-invasive monitoring systems to
mitigate the growing societal and economic burden of cognitive decline in the
aging population.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型使用白噪声，而自然图像的统计特性具有尺度不变性，因此提出使用尺度不变噪声以更好地匹配自然图像的特性。

Method: 在扩散模型中用尺度不变噪声替代白噪声，构建Cloud Diffusion Model。

Result: 预计该模型能实现更快的推理速度、更好的高频细节和更高的可控性。

Conclusion: Cloud Diffusion Model有望成为传统白噪声扩散模型的改进方案，后续将进行实验验证。

Abstract: Diffusion models for image generation function by progressively adding noise
to an image set and training a model to separate out the signal from the noise.
The noise profile used by these models is white noise -- that is, noise based
on independent normal distributions at each point whose mean and variance is
independent of the scale. By contrast, most natural image sets exhibit a type
of scale invariance in their low-order statistical properties characterized by
a power-law scaling. Consequently, natural images are closer (in a quantifiable
sense) to a different probability distribution that emphasizes large scale
correlations and de-emphasizes small scale correlations. These scale invariant
noise profiles can be incorporated into diffusion models in place of white
noise to form what we will call a ``Cloud Diffusion Model". We argue that these
models can lead to faster inference, improved high-frequency details, and
greater controllability. In a follow-up paper, we will build and train a Cloud
Diffusion Model that uses scale invariance at a fundamental level and compare
it to classic, white noise diffusion models.

TL;DR: LoomNet是一种新颖的多视角扩散架构，通过并行应用同一扩散模型生成一致的多视角图像，显著提升了3D网格质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单图像生成多视角图像时空间一致性不足的问题，以提升3D重建质量。

Method: 使用多视角扩散模型，通过共享潜在空间和正交平面投影融合多视角信息，生成一致的多视角图像。

Result: LoomNet在15秒内生成16个高质量且一致的多视角图像，在图像质量和重建指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LoomNet通过创新的多视角融合方法，显著提升了多视角图像生成的一致性和质量。

Abstract: Generating consistent multi-view images from a single image remains
challenging. Lack of spatial consistency often degrades 3D mesh quality in
surface reconstruction. To address this, we propose LoomNet, a novel multi-view
diffusion architecture that produces coherent images by applying the same
diffusion model multiple times in parallel to collaboratively build and
leverage a shared latent space for view consistency. Each viewpoint-specific
inference generates an encoding representing its own hypothesis of the novel
view from a given camera pose, which is projected onto three orthogonal planes.
For each plane, encodings from all views are fused into a single aggregated
plane. These aggregated planes are then processed to propagate information and
interpolate missing regions, combining the hypotheses into a unified, coherent
interpretation. The final latent space is then used to render consistent
multi-view images. LoomNet generates 16 high-quality and coherent views in just
15 seconds. In our experiments, LoomNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
both image quality and reconstruction metrics, also showing creativity by
producing diverse, plausible novel views from the same input.

Conclusion: 模型在检索精度上表现优异，但在存储和效率上存在权衡。

Abstract: Motivated by the growing demand for retrieval systems that operate across
modalities, we introduce llama-nemoretriever-colembed, a unified text-image
retrieval model that delivers state-of-the-art performance across multiple
benchmarks. We release two model variants, 1B and 3B. The 3B model achieves
state of the art performance, scoring NDCG@5 91.0 on ViDoRe V1 and 63.5 on
ViDoRe V2, placing first on both leaderboards as of June 27, 2025.
  Our approach leverages the NVIDIA Eagle2 Vision-Language model (VLM),
modifies its architecture by replacing causal attention with bidirectional
attention, and integrates a ColBERT-style late interaction mechanism to enable
fine-grained multimodal retrieval in a shared embedding space. While this
mechanism delivers superior retrieval accuracy, it introduces trade-offs in
storage and efficiency. We provide a comprehensive analysis of these
trade-offs. Additionally, we adopt a two-stage training strategy to enhance the
model's retrieval capabilities.

tailored to challenging African driving scenarios. Our refractive module
simulates optical effects from low-quality lenses and air turbulence, including
lens distortion, Perlin noise, Thin-Plate Spline (TPS), and divergence-free
(incompressible) warps. The weather module adds homogeneous fog, heterogeneous
fog, and lens flare. To establish a benchmark, we provide baseline performance
using three image restoration models. To support perception research in
underrepresented African contexts, without costly data collection, labeling, or
simulation, we release our distortion toolkit, augmented dataset splits, and
benchmark results.

TL;DR: ReLayout利用relation-CoT改进布局生成，通过明确关系定义和布局原型重平衡采样器，生成更结构化、多样化的布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的布局生成方法未能充分解释视觉主题与设计元素间的空间关系，导致结构性和多样性问题。

Method: 引入relation-CoT，明确关系定义（如区域、显著性和边距），并设计布局原型重平衡采样器，量化布局风格。

Result: 实验表明ReLayout优于基线方法，生成更符合人类审美且可解释的布局。

Conclusion: ReLayout通过关系定义和原型重平衡，解决了布局生成中的结构性和多样性问题。

Abstract: Content-aware layout aims to arrange design elements appropriately on a given
canvas to convey information effectively. Recently, the trend for this task has
been to leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate layouts
automatically, achieving remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based
methods fail to adequately interpret spatial relationships among visual themes
and design elements, leading to structural and diverse problems in layout
generation. To address this issue, we introduce ReLayout, a novel method that
leverages relation-CoT to generate more reasonable and aesthetically coherent
layouts by fundamentally originating from design concepts. Specifically, we
enhance layout annotations by introducing explicit relation definitions, such
as region, salient, and margin between elements, with the goal of decomposing
the layout into smaller, structured, and recursive layouts, thereby enabling
the generation of more structured layouts. Furthermore, based on these defined
relationships, we introduce a layout prototype rebalance sampler, which defines
layout prototype features across three dimensions and quantifies distinct
layout styles. This sampler addresses uniformity issues in generation that
arise from data bias in the prototype distribution balance process. Extensive
experimental results verify that ReLayout outperforms baselines and can
generate structural and diverse layouts that are more aligned with human
aesthetics and more explainable.

TL;DR: 提出了一种跨模态转换引导网络（CTNet），用于解决多模态人脸反欺骗（FAS）中的分布差异和模态缺失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态FAS中，不同模态的数据分布差异大，且测试时可能缺失某些模态。活体样本的跨模态特征转换更一致，而欺骗样本则不一致。

Method: 学习活体样本的跨模态特征一致性，构建广义特征空间；学习活体和欺骗样本的跨模态不一致性以检测异常攻击；从RGB模态补充学习IR和深度特征。

Result: CTNet在大多数协议下优于现有的多模态FAS方法。

Conclusion: CTNet通过跨模态特征转换和模态补充学习，有效提升了多模态FAS的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to detect genuine human presence by
extracting discriminative liveness cues from multiple modalities, such as RGB,
infrared (IR), and depth images, to enhance the robustness of biometric
authentication systems. However, because data from different modalities are
typically captured by various camera sensors and under diverse environmental
conditions, multi-modal FAS often exhibits significantly greater distribution
discrepancies across training and testing domains compared to single-modal FAS.
Furthermore, during the inference stage, multi-modal FAS confronts even greater
challenges when one or more modalities are unavailable or inaccessible. In this
paper, we propose a novel Cross-modal Transition-guided Network (CTNet) to
tackle the challenges in the multi-modal FAS task. Our motivation stems from
that, within a single modality, the visual differences between live faces are
typically much smaller than those of spoof faces. Additionally, feature
transitions across modalities are more consistent for the live class compared
to those between live and spoof classes. Upon this insight, we first propose
learning consistent cross-modal feature transitions among live samples to
construct a generalized feature space. Next, we introduce learning the
inconsistent cross-modal feature transitions between live and spoof samples to
effectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks during inference. To
further address the issue of missing modalities, we propose learning
complementary infrared (IR) and depth features from the RGB modality as
auxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CTNet
outperforms previous two-class multi-modal FAS methods across most protocols.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业质量检测中，传统缺陷检测方法效率低、成本高且鲁棒性差，亟需一种高精度且依赖标签少的解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段协作训练机制和联合优化策略，利用标记数据进行初始训练，并通过生成伪标签引入未标记数据。条件扩散模型生成多尺度伪缺陷样本，CLIP跨模态特征过滤机制减少标签污染。

Result: 在NEU-DET数据集上，使用与传统监督方法相同标记数据量时达到78.4% mAP@0.5，仅需40%标记数据时达到75.1% mAP@0.5。

Conclusion: DSYM框架为工业质量检测提供了一种高精度、低标签依赖的缺陷检测解决方案，并已开源。

Abstract: In the realm of industrial quality inspection, defect detection stands as a
critical component, particularly in high-precision, safety-critical sectors
such as automotive components aerospace, and medical devices. Traditional
methods, reliant on manual inspection or early image processing algorithms,
suffer from inefficiencies, high costs, and limited robustness. This paper
introduces a semi-supervised defect detection framework based on conditional
diffusion (DSYM), leveraging a two-stage collaborative training mechanism and a
staged joint optimization strategy. The framework utilizes labeled data for
initial training and subsequently incorporates unlabeled data through the
generation of pseudo-labels. A conditional diffusion model synthesizes
multi-scale pseudo-defect samples, while a CLIP cross-modal feature-based noise
filtering mechanism mitigates label contamination. Experimental results on the
NEU-DET dataset demonstrate a 78.4% mAP@0.5 with the same amount of labeled
data as traditional supervised methods, and 75.1% mAP@0.5 with only 40% of the
labeled data required by the original supervised model, showcasing significant
advantages in data efficiency. This research provides a high-precision,
low-labeling-dependent solution for defect detection in industrial quality
inspection scenarios. The work of this article has been open-sourced at

TL;DR: GSVR是一种基于2D高斯分布的视频表示方法，显著提升了视频解码速度和训练效率，同时保持了高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频表示方法在解码速度和训练时间上存在不足，尤其是卷积网络的高计算量导致效率低下。

Method: 提出GSVR，结合混合变形场、动态感知时间切片策略和量化感知微调，优化视频动态建模和压缩。

Result: 在Bunny和UVG数据集上，GSVR实现了800+ FPS的解码速度和35+ PSNR，训练时间仅为每帧2秒。

Conclusion: GSVR在视频插值和压缩任务中表现优异，解码速度比现有方法快10倍，且训练效率显著提升。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations for video have been recognized as a novel and
promising form of video representation. Existing works pay more attention to
improving video reconstruction quality but little attention to the decoding
speed. However, the high computation of convolutional network used in existing
methods leads to low decoding speed. Moreover, these convolution-based video
representation methods also suffer from long training time, about 14 seconds
per frame to achieve 35+ PSNR on Bunny. To solve the above problems, we propose
GSVR, a novel 2D Gaussian-based video representation, which achieves 800+ FPS
and 35+ PSNR on Bunny, only needing a training time of $2$ seconds per frame.
Specifically, we propose a hybrid deformation field to model the dynamics of
the video, which combines two motion patterns, namely the tri-plane motion and
the polynomial motion, to deal with the coupling of camera motion and object
motion in the video. Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-aware Time Slicing
strategy to adaptively divide the video into multiple groups of pictures(GOP)
based on the dynamic level of the video in order to handle large camera motion
and non-rigid movements. Finally, we propose quantization-aware fine-tuning to
avoid performance reduction after quantization and utilize image codecs to
compress Gaussians to achieve a compact representation. Experiments on the
Bunny and UVG datasets confirm that our method converges much faster than
existing methods and also has 10x faster decoding speed compared to other
methods. Our method has comparable performance in the video interpolation task
to SOTA and attains better video compression performance than NeRV.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成的设计通常缺乏可编辑性，但能启发设计师的布局和文本风格选择。Accordion旨在解决这一问题，将AI设计转换为可编辑的分层设计。

Method: 基于视觉语言模型（VLM），分三个阶段执行任务，采用自上而下的方法，利用视觉和谐的参考图像全局指导分层分解，并结合SAM等视觉专家模型。

Result: 在DesignIntention基准测试中表现优异，支持文本到模板、背景添加文本和文本去渲染等任务，并能生成设计变体。

Conclusion: Accordion成功地将AI生成设计转换为可编辑的分层设计，并通过用户研究验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Graphic design is crucial for conveying ideas and messages. Designers usually
organize their work into objects, backgrounds, and vectorized text layers to
simplify editing. However, this workflow demands considerable expertise. With
the rise of GenAI methods, an endless supply of high-quality graphic designs in
pixel format has become more accessible, though these designs often lack
editability. Despite this, non-layered designs still inspire human designers,
influencing their choices in layouts and text styles, ultimately guiding the
creation of layered designs. Motivated by this observation, we propose
Accordion, a graphic design generation framework taking the first attempt to
convert AI-generated designs into editable layered designs, meanwhile refining
nonsensical AI-generated text with meaningful alternatives guided by user
prompts. It is built around a vision language model (VLM) playing distinct
roles in three curated stages. For each stage, we design prompts to guide the
VLM in executing different tasks. Distinct from existing bottom-up methods
(e.g., COLE and Open-COLE) that gradually generate elements to create layered
designs, our approach works in a top-down manner by using the visually
harmonious reference image as global guidance to decompose each layer.
Additionally, it leverages multiple vision experts such as SAM and element
removal models to facilitate the creation of graphic layers. We train our
method using the in-house graphic design dataset Design39K, augmented with
AI-generated design images coupled with refined ground truth created by a
customized inpainting model. Experimental results and user studies by designers
show that Accordion generates favorable results on the DesignIntention
benchmark, including tasks such as text-to-template, adding text to background,
and text de-rendering, and also excels in creating design variations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图像修复中常出现不一致的保真度和不良伪影，KDS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: KDS使用N粒子扩散样本集合，通过计算其输出的局部核密度估计梯度，引导样本向共享的高密度区域移动，避免伪影。

Result: 实验表明，KDS在超分辨率和图像修复任务中显著提升了定量和定性性能。

Conclusion: KDS作为一种即插即用框架，无需重新训练或外部验证器，可无缝集成到各种扩散采样器中，实现高质量样本生成。

Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for image restoration, but existing methods
often struggle with inconsistent fidelity and undesirable artifacts. To address
this, we introduce Kernel Density Steering (KDS), a novel inference-time
framework promoting robust, high-fidelity outputs through explicit local
mode-seeking. KDS employs an $N$-particle ensemble of diffusion samples,
computing patch-wise kernel density estimation gradients from their collective
outputs. These gradients steer patches in each particle towards shared,
higher-density regions identified within the ensemble. This collective local
mode-seeking mechanism, acting as "collective wisdom", steers samples away from
spurious modes prone to artifacts, arising from independent sampling or model
imperfections, and towards more robust, high-fidelity structures. This allows
us to obtain better quality samples at the expense of higher compute by
simultaneously sampling multiple particles. As a plug-and-play framework, KDS
requires no retraining or external verifiers, seamlessly integrating with
various diffusion samplers. Extensive numerical validations demonstrate KDS
substantially improves both quantitative and qualitative performance on
challenging real-world super-resolution and image inpainting tasks.

Conclusion: GenHMC方法提高了数据效率和准确性，为虚拟形象动画提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Enabling photorealistic avatar animations in virtual and augmented reality
(VR/AR) has been challenging because of the difficulty of obtaining ground
truth state of faces. It is physically impossible to obtain synchronized images
from head-mounted cameras (HMC) sensing input, which has partial observations
in infrared (IR), and an array of outside-in dome cameras, which have full
observations that match avatars' appearance. Prior works relying on
analysis-by-synthesis methods could generate accurate ground truth, but suffer
from imperfect disentanglement between expression and style in their
personalized training. The reliance of extensive paired captures (HMC and dome)
for the same subject makes it operationally expensive to collect large-scale
datasets, which cannot be reused for different HMC viewpoints and lighting. In
this work, we propose a novel generative approach, Generative HMC (GenHMC),
that leverages large unpaired HMC captures, which are much easier to collect,
to directly generate high-quality synthetic HMC images given any conditioning
avatar state from dome captures. We show that our method is able to properly
disentangle the input conditioning signal that specifies facial expression and
viewpoint, from facial appearance, leading to more accurate ground truth.
Furthermore, our method can generalize to unseen identities, removing the
reliance on the paired captures. We demonstrate these breakthroughs by both
evaluating synthetic HMC images and universal face encoders trained from these
new HMC-avatar correspondences, which achieve better data efficiency and
state-of-the-art accuracy.

Conclusion: AdaptaGen通过分层语义优化和跨模态适应机制，有效解决了领域特定图像生成中的核心问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Domain-specific image generation aims to produce high-quality visual content
for specialized fields while ensuring semantic accuracy and detail fidelity.
However, existing methods exhibit two critical limitations: First, current
approaches address prompt engineering and model adaptation separately,
overlooking the inherent dependence between semantic understanding and visual
representation in specialized domains. Second, these techniques inadequately
incorporate domain-specific semantic constraints during content synthesis,
resulting in generation outcomes that exhibit hallucinations and semantic
deviations. To tackle these issues, we propose AdaptaGen, a hierarchical
semantic optimization framework that integrates matrix-based prompt
optimization with multi-perspective understanding, capturing comprehensive
semantic relationships from both global and local perspectives. To mitigate
hallucinations in specialized domains, we design a cross-modal adaptation
mechanism, which, when combined with intelligent content synthesis, enables
preserving core thematic elements while incorporating diverse details across
images. Additionally, we introduce a two-phase caption semantic transformation
during the generation phase. This approach maintains semantic coherence while
enhancing visual diversity, ensuring the generated images adhere to
domain-specific constraints. Experimental results confirm our approach's
effectiveness, with our framework achieving superior performance across 40
categories from diverse datasets using only 16 images per category,
demonstrating significant improvements in image quality, diversity, and
semantic consistency.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: OFFSET通过改进特征提取和焦点修正，显著提升了CIR的性能。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) represents a novel retrieval paradigm that is
capable of expressing users' intricate retrieval requirements flexibly. It
enables the user to give a multimodal query, comprising a reference image and a
modification text, and subsequently retrieve the target image. Notwithstanding
the considerable advances made by prevailing methodologies, CIR remains in its
nascent stages due to two limitations: 1) inhomogeneity between dominant and
noisy portions in visual data is ignored, leading to query feature degradation,
and 2) the priority of textual data in the image modification process is
overlooked, which leads to a visual focus bias. To address these two
limitations, this work presents a focus mapping-based feature extractor, which
consists of two modules: dominant portion segmentation and dual focus mapping.
It is designed to identify significant dominant portions in images and guide
the extraction of visual and textual data features, thereby reducing the impact
of noise interference. Subsequently, we propose a textually guided focus
revision module, which can utilize the modification requirements implied in the
text to perform adaptive focus revision on the reference image, thereby
enhancing the perception of the modification focus on the composed features.
The aforementioned modules collectively constitute the segmentatiOn-based Focus
shiFt reviSion nETwork (\mbox{OFFSET}), and comprehensive experiments on four
benchmark datasets substantiate the superiority of our proposed method. The

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过结合Contourlet变换和知识引导的扩散模型，显著提升了PolSAR图像分类的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performance across various
domains due to their ability to model and generate complicated data
distributions. However, when applied to PolSAR data, traditional real-valued
diffusion models face challenges in capturing complex-valued phase
information.Moreover, these models often struggle to preserve fine structural
details. To address these limitations, we leverage the Contourlet transform,
which provides rich multiscale and multidirectional representations well-suited
for PolSAR imagery. We propose a structural knowledge-guided complex diffusion
model for PolSAR image classification in the Contourlet domain. Specifically,
the complex Contourlet transform is first applied to decompose the data into
low- and high-frequency subbands, enabling the extraction of statistical and
boundary features. A knowledge-guided complex diffusion network is then
designed to model the statistical properties of the low-frequency components.
During the process, structural information from high-frequency coefficients is
utilized to guide the diffusion process, improving edge preservation.
Furthermore, multiscale and multidirectional high-frequency features are
jointly learned to further boost classification accuracy. Experimental results
on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in preserving edge details and
maintaining region homogeneity in complex terrain.

Abstract: Pre-trained large vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP demonstrate
impressive generalization ability. Existing prompt-based and adapter-based
works have made significant progress in fine-tuning VLMs but still face the
challenges of maintaining strong generalization abilities, particularly towards
unseen new classes. This limitation partly arises from these methods treating
all tokens of the image and text encoder equally, which can lead to overfitting
on less informative features (e.g., background noise, template words) and
degrade the general representations that are crucial for novel concept
recognition. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Rank Adaptation (DRA), a
novel adapter variant method, designed specifically to enhance new class
generalization. DRA dynamically allocates adaptation ranks based on the
importance of features during training to preserve general knowledge. DRA first
employs token importance grouping, using sequence attention to evaluate and
group tokens by their importance. Then, we adopt rank adaptation according to
the importance of each token group dynamically by assigning higher feature
ranks to the more important tokens. Also, we design a new channel response
mechanism to prioritize the preservation and adaptation of feature channels
identified as the most informative for each instance. In addition, a L1
regularization term is introduced to stabilize the training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed DRA
over existing works, especially on enhancing the performance of new classes on
various benchmarks, including base-new classes, cross-datasets evaluation and
domain generalization. The source code will be published after the paper is
received.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于扩散模型的框架，用于分析和逆转脑损伤过程，通过分割异常区域、估计并逆转组织变形，最终恢复健康脑组织的估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑损伤分割方法未能区分受损和变形组织，而区分两者对临床和研究至关重要。

Method: 使用扩散模型框架，先分割异常区域，再估计并逆转组织变形，最后修复核心损伤区域。

Result: 与传统方法相比，该方法在损伤分割、表征和脑标记方面表现出更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架为脑损伤分析提供了更强大的工具，适用于临床和研究领域。

Abstract: Brain lesions are abnormalities or injuries in brain tissue that are often
detectable using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which reveals structural
changes in the affected areas. This broad definition of brain lesions includes
areas of the brain that are irreversibly damaged, as well as areas of brain
tissue that are deformed as a result of lesion growth or swelling. Despite the
importance of differentiating between damaged and deformed tissue, existing
lesion segmentation methods overlook this distinction, labeling both of them as
a single anomaly. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model-based framework
for analyzing and reversing the brain lesion process. Our pipeline first
segments abnormal regions in the brain, then estimates and reverses tissue
deformations by restoring displaced tissue to its original position, isolating
the core lesion area representing the initial damage. Finally, we inpaint the
core lesion area to arrive at an estimation of the pre-lesion healthy brain.
This proposed framework reverses a forward lesion growth process model that is
well-established in biomechanical studies that model brain lesions. Our results
demonstrate improved accuracy in lesion segmentation, characterization, and
brain labeling compared to traditional methods, offering a robust tool for
clinical and research applications in brain lesion analysis. Since pre-lesion
healthy versions of abnormal brains are not available in any public dataset for
validation of the reverse process, we simulate a forward model to synthesize
multiple lesioned brain images.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合RGB和事件传感器的融合方法，用于解决航天器姿态估计中的极端光照问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航天器姿态估计对自主空间操作至关重要，但传统RGB传感器在极端光照条件下表现不佳，而事件传感器虽动态范围高，但空间分辨率低。

Method: 采用光束分束棱镜实现光学和时间对齐，开发了基于RANSAC的融合技术，并结合dropout不确定性估计。

Result: 在实验室环境下收集了数据集，验证了融合方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 事件-RGB融合方法在极端光照条件下表现优异，支持事件传感器在航天器姿态估计中的应用，数据集将公开。

Abstract: Spacecraft pose estimation is crucial for autonomous in-space operations,
such as rendezvous, docking and on-orbit servicing. Vision-based pose
estimation methods, which typically employ RGB imaging sensors, is a compelling
solution for spacecraft pose estimation, but are challenged by harsh lighting
conditions, which produce imaging artifacts such as glare, over-exposure,
blooming and lens flare. Due to their much higher dynamic range, neuromorphic
or event sensors are more resilient to extreme lighting conditions. However,
event sensors generally have lower spatial resolution and suffer from reduced
signal-to-noise ratio during periods of low relative motion. This work
addresses these individual sensor limitations by introducing a sensor fusion
approach combining RGB and event sensors. A beam-splitter prism was employed to
achieve precise optical and temporal alignment. Then, a RANSAC-based technique
was developed to fuse the information from the RGB and event channels to
achieve pose estimation that leveraged the strengths of the two modalities. The
pipeline was complemented by dropout uncertainty estimation to detect extreme
conditions that affect either channel. To benchmark the performance of the
proposed event-RGB fusion method, we collected a comprehensive real dataset of
RGB and event data for satellite pose estimation in a laboratory setting under
a variety of challenging illumination conditions. Encouraging results on the
dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our event-RGB fusion approach and further
supports the usage of event sensors for spacecraft pose estimation. To support
community research on this topic, our dataset will be released publicly.

Conclusion: R-VLM成功结合视觉语言模型与传统目标检测技术，显著提升了GUI自动化的定位性能。

Abstract: Visual agent models for automating human activities on Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs) have emerged as a promising research direction, driven by
advances in large Vision Language Models (VLMs). A critical challenge in GUI
automation is the precise grounding of interface elements across diverse
platforms. Existing vision-only GUI agents directly ground elements from large
and cluttered screenshots, requiring them to process substantial irrelevant
information that compromises their accuracy. In addition, these approaches
typically employ basic cross-entropy loss for learning grounding objectives,
which fails to effectively capture grounding quality compared to established
object detection metrics like Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To address these
issues, we introduce R-VLM, a novel GUI grounding approach that leverages
zoomed-in region proposals for precise element localization. We also propose an
IoU-aware objective function that facilitates model convergence toward high IoU
predictions. Our approach bridges the gap between VLMs and conventional object
detection techniques, improving the state-of-the-art grounding accuracy by 13%
across diverse GUI platforms on the GUI grounding benchmarks ScreenSpot and
AgentStudio. In addition, our R-VLM approach shows 3.2-9.7% absolute accuracy
improvements in GUI navigation tasks on the AITW and Mind2Web benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have shown remarkable progress in
open-domain settings, yet medical video generation remains largely
underexplored. Medical videos are critical for applications such as clinical
training, education, and simulation, requiring not only high visual fidelity
but also strict medical accuracy. However, current models often produce
unrealistic or erroneous content when applied to medical prompts, largely due
to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets tailored to the medical
domain. To address this gap, we introduce MedVideoCap-55K, the first
large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation. It
comprises over 55,000 curated clips spanning real-world medical scenarios,
providing a strong foundation for training generalist medical video generation
models. Built upon this dataset, we develop MedGen, which achieves leading
performance among open-source models and rivals commercial systems across
multiple benchmarks in both visual quality and medical accuracy. We hope our
dataset and model can serve as a valuable resource and help catalyze further
research in medical video generation. Our code and data is available at

Result: 在基础到新类别泛化、跨数据集评估和领域泛化三种设置下，ISP表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ISP通过结构关系建模和动态损失调整，显著提升了VLM的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Prompt learning methods have significantly extended the transferability of
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream
tasks. These methods adopt handcraft templates or learnable vectors to provide
text or image instructions in fine-tuning VLMs. However, most existing works
ignore the structural relationships between learnable prompts and tokens within
and between modalities. Moreover, balancing the performance of base and new
classes remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an
Integrated Structural Prompt (ISP) for VLMs to enhance the interaction of
information representations between the text and image branches. ISP introduces
self-structural and cross-structural prompt modules to model the structural
relationships between learnable prompts and frozen tokens within and across
modalities. This enables efficient information transfer while preserving
feature stability. Additionally, we propose a sample probing module that
dynamically adjusts loss coefficients based on sample difficulty, preventing
the mode from overfitting to simple samples and improving generalization
ability to new classes. Extensive experiments on three widely used settings:
base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization
demonstrate that the proposed ISP achieves competitive performance against
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有方法在控制相机轨迹和物体运动时存在融合不稳定和非线性可扩展性问题。

Method: 提出LiON-LoRA框架，分析浅层VDM中LoRA特征的正交性，强制层间范数一致性，并引入可控令牌到扩散变换器中。

Result: 实验表明，LiON-LoRA在轨迹控制精度和运动强度调整上优于现有方法，且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: LiON-LoRA通过改进的LoRA融合机制，实现了对视频生成中空间和时间控制的统一与优化。

Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
synthesizing realistic videos by learning from large-scale data. Although
vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can learn specific spatial or temporal
movement to driven VDMs with constrained data, achieving precise control over
both camera trajectories and object motion remains challenging due to the
unstable fusion and non-linear scalability. To address these issues, we propose
LiON-LoRA, a novel framework that rethinks LoRA fusion through three core
principles: Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. First, we
analyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling
decoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced
across layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations.
Third, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT)
to linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a
modified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we
extend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos,
unifying spatial and temporal controllability. Experiments demonstrate that
LiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy
and motion strength adjustment, achieving superior generalization with minimal
training data. Project Page: https://fuchengsu.github.io/lionlora.github.io/

Abstract: Hyperspectral images are high-dimensional datasets consisting of hundreds of
contiguous spectral bands, enabling detailed material and surface analysis.
Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) refers to the technique of identifying
and locating anomalous targets in such data without prior information about a
hyperspectral scene or target spectrum. This technology has seen rapid
advancements in recent years, with applications in agriculture, defence,
military surveillance, and environmental monitoring. Despite this significant
progress, existing HAD methods continue to face challenges such as high
computational complexity, sensitivity to noise, and limited generalisation
across diverse datasets. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of
various HAD techniques, categorising them into statistical models,
representation-based methods, classical machine learning approaches, and deep
learning models. We evaluated these methods across 17 benchmarking datasets
using different performance metrics, such as ROC, AUC, and separability map to
analyse detection accuracy, computational efficiency, their strengths,
limitations, and directions for future research.The research shows that deep
learning models achieved the highest detection accuracy, while statistical
models demonstrated exceptional speed across all datasets. This study aims to
provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working to advance
the field of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods.

TL;DR: SenseShift6D是首个RGB-D数据集，通过物理调整传感器参数（如曝光、增益、深度模式）和光照条件，探索6D物体姿态估计在真实世界变化中的表现。实验表明，测试时传感器控制优于数据增强，且多模态传感器联合调整效果更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计数据集在固定光照和传感器设置下表现良好，但真实世界的变化（如光照、传感器参数）对其影响未被充分研究。SenseShift6D旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过物理调整13种RGB曝光、9种RGB增益、自动曝光、4种深度模式和5种光照水平，生成101.9k RGB和10k深度图像，覆盖1,380种传感器-光照组合。

Result: 测试时传感器控制比数据增强效果更好，性能接近或优于增加真实训练数据。RGB或深度传感器单独调整有效，联合调整效果更显著。

Conclusion: SenseShift6D将6D姿态评估从数据为中心扩展到传感器感知的鲁棒性，为自适应感知系统在不确定环境中的稳健运行奠定基础。

Abstract: Recent advances on 6D object-pose estimation has achieved high performance on
representative benchmarks such as LM-O, YCB-V, and T-Less. However, these
datasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving
the impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or
depth-sensor mode - and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate
such variations - largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
SenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures,
9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels.
For three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire
101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting
permutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our
dataset show that applying sensor control during test-time induces greater
performance improvement over digital data augmentation, achieving performance
comparable to or better than costly increases in real-world training data
quantity and diversity. Adapting either RGB or depth sensors individually is
effective, while jointly adapting multimodal RGB-D configurations yields even
greater improvements. SenseShift6D extends the 6D-pose evaluation paradigm from
data-centered to sensor-aware robustness, laying a foundation for adaptive,
self-tuning perception systems capable of operating robustly in uncertain
real-world environments. Our dataset is available at:

article presents an entirely automatic mechanism for balancing the white level

results of the algorithm have been confirmed experimentally on a set of two
hundred microscopic images. The images contained scans of three microscopic
specimens commonly used in pathomorphology. Also, the results achieved were
compared with other commonly used white balance algorithms in digital

classical algorithms used in colour photography for microscopic images stained
with hematoxylin-phloxine-saffron and for immunohistochemical staining images.

Abstract: Generating articulated objects, such as laptops and microwaves, is a crucial
yet challenging task with extensive applications in Embodied AI and AR/VR.
Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture,
neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural
reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense
multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we
introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity,
interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a
three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D
object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D
segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video
diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable
part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by
occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by
a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to
ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results
demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated
objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and
plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated
asset generation. Our project page is available at

Result: 在PSG和Visual Genome数据集上，SPADE在封闭和开放场景中均优于现有方法，尤其在空间关系预测上表现突出。

Conclusion: SPADE通过空间感知设计有效解决了VLMs在空间推理上的不足，为开放词汇PSG提供了新思路。

Abstract: Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) integrates instance segmentation with
relation understanding to capture pixel-level structural relationships in
complex scenes. Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the
open-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs
in spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object
relative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction. Motivated
by the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial
structure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork)
framework -- a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two
key steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaptation, and (2)
spatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general
pre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with
cross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based
fine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation
graph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual
information, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries.
Extensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate
that SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set
scenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.

Abstract: Document reconstruction constitutes a significant facet of document analysis
and recognition, a field that has been progressively accruing interest within
the scholarly community. A multitude of these researchers employ an array of
document understanding models to generate predictions on distinct subtasks,
subsequently integrating their results into a holistic document reconstruction
format via heuristic principles. Nevertheless, these multi-stage methodologies
are hindered by the phenomenon of error propagation, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Furthermore, contemporary studies utilize generative models to
extract the logical sequence of plain text, tables and mathematical expressions
in an end-to-end process. However, this approach is deficient in preserving the
information related to element layouts, which are vital for document
reconstruction. To surmount these aforementioned limitations, we in this paper
present an innovative autoregressive model specifically designed for document
reconstruction, referred to as Document Reconstruction via End-to-end
Autoregressive Model (DREAM). DREAM transmutes the text image into a sequence
of document reconstruction in a comprehensive, end-to-end process,
encapsulating a broader spectrum of document element information. In addition,
we establish a standardized definition of the document reconstruction task, and
introduce a novel Document Similarity Metric (DSM) and DocRec1K dataset for
assessing the performance of the task. Empirical results substantiate that our
methodology attains unparalleled performance in the realm of document
reconstruction. Furthermore, the results on a variety of subtasks, encompassing
document layout analysis, text recognition, table structure recognition,
formula recognition and reading order detection, indicate that our model is
competitive and compatible with various tasks.

Abstract: The development of safe and robust autonomous driving functions is heavily
dependent on large-scale, high-quality sensor data. However, real-word data
acquisition demands intensive human labor and is strongly limited by factors
such as labeling cost, driver safety protocols and diverse scenario coverage.
Thus, multiple lines of work focus on the conditional generation of synthetic
camera sensor data. We identify a significant gap in research regarding daytime
variation, presumably caused by the scarcity of available labels. Consequently,
we present the solar altitude as global conditioning variable. It is readily
computable from latitude-longitude coordinates and local time, eliminating the
need for extensive manual labeling. Our work is complemented by a tailored
normalization approach, targeting the sensitivity of daylight towards small
numeric changes in altitude. We demonstrate its ability to accurately capture
lighting characteristics and illumination-dependent image noise in the context
of diffusion models.

Abstract: As critical transportation infrastructure, bridges face escalating challenges
from aging and deterioration, while traditional manual inspection methods
suffer from low efficiency. Although 3D point cloud technology provides a new
data-driven paradigm, its application potential is often constrained by the
incompleteness of real-world data, which results from missing labels and
scanning occlusions. To overcome the bottleneck of insufficient generalization
in existing synthetic data methods, this paper proposes a systematic framework
for generating 3D bridge data.
  This framework can automatically generate complete point clouds featuring
component-level instance annotations, high-fidelity color, and precise normal
vectors. It can be further extended to simulate the creation of diverse and
physically realistic incomplete point clouds, designed to support the training
of segmentation and completion networks, respectively. Experiments demonstrate
that a PointNet++ model trained with our synthetic data achieves a mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 84.2% in real-world bridge semantic
segmentation. Concurrently, a fine-tuned KT-Net exhibits superior performance
on the component completion task.
  This research offers an innovative methodology and a foundational dataset for
the 3D visual analysis of bridge structures, holding significant implications
for advancing the automated management and maintenance of infrastructure.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在一致性和对象身份保持上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为2D图像编辑提供了一种更一致且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models have achieved significant progress in advancing 2D image
editing, demonstrating exceptional precision and realism. However, they often
struggle with consistency and object identity preservation due to their
inherent pixel-manipulation nature. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel "2D-3D-2D" framework. Our approach begins by lifting 2D objects into 3D
representation, enabling edits within a physically plausible,
rigidity-constrained 3D environment. The edited 3D objects are then reprojected
and seamlessly inpainted back into the original 2D image. In contrast to
existing 2D editing methods, such as DragGAN and DragDiffusion, our method
directly manipulates objects in a 3D environment. Extensive experiments
highlight that our framework surpasses previous methods in general performance,
delivering highly consistent edits while robustly preserving object identity.

Abstract: Current video understanding models excel at recognizing "what" is happening
but fall short in high-level cognitive tasks like causal reasoning and future
prediction, a limitation rooted in their lack of commonsense world knowledge.
To bridge this cognitive gap, we propose a novel framework that synergistically
fuses a powerful Vision Foundation Model (VFM) for deep visual perception with
a Large Language Model (LLM) serving as a knowledge-driven reasoning core. Our
key technical innovation is a sophisticated fusion module, inspired by the
Q-Former architecture, which distills complex spatiotemporal and object-centric
visual features into a concise, language-aligned representation. This enables
the LLM to effectively ground its inferential processes in direct visual
evidence. The model is trained via a two-stage strategy, beginning with
large-scale alignment pre-training on video-text data, followed by targeted
instruction fine-tuning on a curated dataset designed to elicit advanced
reasoning and prediction skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks.
Notably, it exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen reasoning
tasks, and our in-depth ablation studies validate the critical contribution of
each architectural component. This work pushes the boundary of machine
perception from simple recognition towards genuine cognitive understanding,
paving the way for more intelligent and capable AI systems in robotics,
human-computer interaction, and beyond.

Conclusion: I²R方法通过解决语义差距和视觉相似性问题，显著提升了少样本语义分割的性能。

Abstract: The annotation bottleneck in semantic segmentation has driven significant
interest in few-shot segmentation, which aims to develop segmentation models
capable of generalizing rapidly to novel classes using minimal exemplars.
Conventional training paradigms typically generate query prior maps by
extracting masked-area features from support images, followed by making
predictions guided by these prior maps. However, current approaches remain
constrained by two critical limitations stemming from inter- and intra-image
discrepancies, both of which significantly degrade segmentation performance: 1)
The semantic gap between support and query images results in mismatched
features and inaccurate prior maps; 2) Visually similar yet semantically
distinct regions within support or query images lead to false negative or false
positive predictions. We propose a novel FSS method called \textbf{I$^2$R}: 1)
Using category-specific high level representations which aggregate global
semantic cues from support and query images, enabling more precise inter-image
region localization and address the first limitation. 2) Directional masking
strategy that suppresses inconsistent support-query pixel pairs, which exhibit
high feature similarity but conflicting mask, to mitigate the second issue.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving improvements of 1.9\% and 2.1\% in mIoU under the 1-shot
setting on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ benchmarks, respectively.

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在IoD和Pearson-R相关性等临床指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: USIGAN方法有效提升了IHC虚拟染色的病理语义一致性，具有显著的临床意义。

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) virtual staining is a task that generates virtual
IHC images from H\&E images while maintaining pathological semantic consistency
with adjacent slices. This task aims to achieve cross-domain mapping between
morphological structures and staining patterns through generative models,
providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for pathological analysis.
However, under weakly paired conditions, spatial heterogeneity between adjacent
slices presents significant challenges. This can lead to inaccurate one-to-many
mappings and generate results that are inconsistent with the pathological
semantics of adjacent slices. To address this issue, we propose a novel
unbalanced self-information feature transport for IHC virtual staining, named
USIGAN, which extracts global morphological semantics without relying on
positional correspondence.By removing weakly paired terms in the joint marginal
distribution, we effectively mitigate the impact of weak pairing on joint
distributions, thereby significantly improving the content consistency and
pathological semantic consistency of the generated results. Moreover, we design
the Unbalanced Optimal Transport Consistency (UOT-CTM) mechanism and the
Pathology Self-Correspondence (PC-SCM) mechanism to construct correlation
matrices between H\&E and generated IHC in image-level and real IHC and
generated IHC image sets in intra-group level.. Experiments conducted on two
publicly available datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance across multiple clinically significant metrics, such as IoD and
Pearson-R correlation, demonstrating better clinical relevance.

Motivation: 现有方法在空间建模能力和跨作物类型及年份的泛化能力上存在不足，DFYP旨在解决这些问题。

Method: DFYP包含三个关键组件：分辨率感知通道注意力模块（RCA）、自适应算子学习网络（AOL-Net）和双分支架构，结合可学习融合机制。

Result: 在MODIS和Sentinel-2数据集上，DFYP在RMSE、MAE和R2指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DFYP在多种农业场景下表现出高效性和鲁棒性，适用于实际农业监测。

Abstract: Accurate remote sensing-based crop yield prediction remains a fundamental
challenging task due to complex spatial patterns, heterogeneous spectral
characteristics, and dynamic agricultural conditions. Existing methods often
suffer from limited spatial modeling capacity, weak generalization across crop
types and years. To address these challenges, we propose DFYP, a novel Dynamic
Fusion framework for crop Yield Prediction, which combines spectral channel
attention, edge-adaptive spatial modeling and a learnable fusion mechanism to
improve robustness across diverse agricultural scenarios. Specifically, DFYP
introduces three key components: (1) a Resolution-aware Channel Attention (RCA)
module that enhances spectral representation by adaptively reweighting input
channels based on resolution-specific characteristics; (2) an Adaptive Operator
Learning Network (AOL-Net) that dynamically selects operators for convolutional
kernels to improve edge-sensitive spatial feature extraction under varying crop
and temporal conditions; and (3) a dual-branch architecture with a learnable
fusion mechanism, which jointly models local spatial details and global
contextual information to support cross-resolution and cross-crop
generalization. Extensive experiments on multi-year datasets MODIS and
multi-crop dataset Sentinel-2 demonstrate that DFYP consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art baselines in RMSE, MAE, and R2 across different
spatial resolutions, crop types, and time periods, showcasing its effectiveness
and robustness for real-world agricultural monitoring.

Conclusion: D-FCGS为动态3D高斯点云的前馈压缩提供了新思路，推动了FVV的可扩展传输和存储。

Abstract: Free-viewpoint video (FVV) enables immersive 3D experiences, but efficient
compression of dynamic 3D representations remains a major challenge. Recent
advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its dynamic extensions have
enabled high-fidelity scene modeling. However, existing methods often couple
scene reconstruction with optimization-dependent coding, which limits
generalizability. This paper presents Feedforward Compression of Dynamic
Gaussian Splatting (D-FCGS), a novel feedforward framework for compressing
temporally correlated Gaussian point cloud sequences. Our approach introduces a
Group-of-Frames (GoF) structure with I-P frame coding, where inter-frame
motions are extracted via sparse control points. The resulting motion tensors
are compressed in a feedforward manner using a dual prior-aware entropy model
that combines hyperprior and spatial-temporal priors for accurate rate
estimation. For reconstruction, we perform control-point-guided motion
compensation and employ a refinement network to enhance view-consistent
fidelity. Trained on multi-view video-derived Gaussian frames, D-FCGS
generalizes across scenes without per-scene optimization. Experiments show that
it matches the rate-distortion performance of optimization-based methods,
achieving over 40 times compression in under 2 seconds while preserving visual
quality across viewpoints. This work advances feedforward compression for
dynamic 3DGS, paving the way for scalable FVV transmission and storage in
immersive applications.

Motivation: 现有遥感视觉语言模型（RS-VLMs）在像素级任务和小目标识别上表现不佳，且处理高分辨率图像时计算资源消耗大，限制了实际应用。

Method: GeoMag引入任务驱动的多粒度分辨率调整（TMRA）和提示引导的语义感知裁剪（PSC），动态优化任务相关区域的视觉表示，减少无关区域的分辨率。

Result: 在10个基准测试中，GeoMag在像素级任务上表现优异，同时在其他粒度任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: GeoMag通过动态注意力机制和任务驱动的优化，显著提升了遥感图像解析的效率和性能。

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing (RS) image
understanding has achieved notable progress, demonstrating the basic ability to
recognize and describe geographical entities. However, existing RS-VLMs are
mostly limited to image-level and region-level tasks, lacking the capability to
handle pixel-level tasks and performing poorly in small-object recognition
scenarios. Moreover, RS-VLMs consume significant computational resources when
processing high-resolution RS images, further restricting their practical
applicability. In this context, we propose GeoMag (Geographical Magnifier), an
end-to-end general-purpose large model framework for RS. GeoMag dynamically
focuses the attention scope based on prompt semantics to effectively perform
remote sensing image parsing across multiple levels of granularity. This method
introduces Task-driven Multi-granularity Resolution Adjustment (TMRA) and
Prompt-guided Semantic-aware Cropping (PSC), which adaptively reduce the
spatial resolution of task-irrelevant regions while enhancing the visual
representation of task-relevant areas. This approach improves the model's
perception of critical target regions, suppresses background redundancy, and
reduces the computational cost of interpreting high-resolution RS imagery.
Extensive comparative experiments on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that GeoMag not
only excels in handling pixel-level tasks but also maintains competitive
performance across tasks of other granularities compared to existing RS-VLMs.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅解决了数据缺失问题，还在完整和缺失模态下均表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal data is known to be helpful for visual tracking by improving
robustness to appearance variations. However, sensor synchronization challenges
often compromise data availability, particularly in video settings where
shortages can be temporal. Despite its importance, this area remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on
tracker performance with temporally incomplete multimodal data. Unsurprisingly,
under such a circumstance, existing trackers exhibit significant performance
degradation, as their rigid architectures lack the adaptability needed to
effectively handle missing modalities. To address these limitations, we propose
a flexible framework for robust multimodal tracking. We venture that a tracker
should dynamically activate computational units based on missing data rates.
This is achieved through a novel Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts fusion
mechanism with adaptive complexity, coupled with a video-level masking strategy
that ensures both temporal consistency and spatial completeness which is
critical for effective video tracking. Surprisingly, our model not only adapts
to varying missing rates but also adjusts to scene complexity. Extensive
experiments show that our model achieves SOTA performance across 9 benchmarks,
excelling in both conventional complete and missing modality settings. The code

Abstract: The development of explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methods for
scene classification problems has attracted great attention in remote sensing
(RS). Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially
developed for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their
direct usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper,
we investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the
context of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and
experimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories
(faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to
five established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP,
and DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies
key limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of
perturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on
perturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based
approaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same
image, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance
disproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we
find limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same
problems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity
metrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast,
robustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater
stability. Our experimental results support these methodological findings.
Based on our analysis, we provide guidelines for selecting explanation methods,
metrics, and hyperparameters in the context of RS image scene classification.

Result: 在无标注数据上表现优于GRPO，OOD任务提升5.2%，超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: MGPO通过强化学习有效激发模型的自发定位能力，显著提升性能。

Abstract: State-of-the-art large multi-modal models (LMMs) face challenges when
processing high-resolution images, as these inputs are converted into enormous
visual tokens, many of which are irrelevant to the downstream task. In this
paper, we propose Multi-turn Grounding-based Policy Optimization (MGPO), an
end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables LMMs to
iteratively focus on key visual regions by automatically cropping sub-images,
based on model-predicted grounding coordinates within a multi-turn conversation
framework. Compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which requires costly
additional grounding annotations, our approach highlights that LMMs can emerge
robust grounding abilities during the RL training process, leveraging only a
binary reward function derived from the correctness of the final answer.
Additionally, we observe that LMMs struggle to autonomously trigger visual
grounding during the rollout process. To address this cold start problem, we
design a multi-turn conversational template and restrict policy loss
computation to model outputs generated across multiple dialogue rounds, thereby
promoting stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when
trained on standard visual-question-short answering data without grounding
annotations, MGPO effectively elicits stronger grounding capabilities compared
to GRPO, leading to 5.4\% improvement on in-distribution MME-Realworld and
5.2\% improvement on the challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) V* Bench.
Notably, MGPO post-training on Qwen2.5-VL-7B with 21K samples surpasses
OpenAI's o1 and GPT-4o models on the OOD V* Bench. Codes are available at

Result: EDC和SV显著提升了VIS性能，EDC方法在OVIS基准上达到56.2 AP，创下新记录。

Conclusion: 深度信息是提升视频理解鲁棒性的关键因素。

Abstract: Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) fundamentally struggles with pervasive
challenges including object occlusions, motion blur, and appearance variations
during temporal association. To overcome these limitations, this work
introduces geometric awareness to enhance VIS robustness by strategically
leveraging monocular depth estimation. We systematically investigate three
distinct integration paradigms. Expanding Depth Channel (EDC) method
concatenates the depth map as input channel to segmentation networks; Sharing
ViT (SV) designs a uniform ViT backbone, shared between depth estimation and
segmentation branches; Depth Supervision (DS) makes use of depth prediction as
an auxiliary training guide for feature learning. Though DS exhibits limited
effectiveness, benchmark evaluations demonstrate that EDC and SV significantly
enhance the robustness of VIS. When with Swin-L backbone, our EDC method gets
56.2 AP, which sets a new state-of-the-art result on OVIS benchmark. This work
conclusively establishes depth cues as critical enablers for robust video
understanding.

Method: 两阶段方法：先预测体素占用率，再在占用率高的体素中进行特征计算和体积渲染；开发了高效采样和特征聚合算法。

Result: 存储需求减少50倍以上，支持512^3分辨率重建，精度优于当前最优方法。

Conclusion: 稀疏表示方法显著提升重建质量和效率，适用于高分辨率场景。

Abstract: Generalizable neural surface reconstruction has become a compelling technique
to reconstruct from few images without per-scene optimization, where dense 3D
feature volume has proven effective as a global representation of scenes.
However, the dense representation does not scale well to increasing voxel
resolutions, severely limiting the reconstruction quality. We thus present a
sparse representation method, that maximizes memory efficiency and enables
significantly higher resolution reconstructions on standard hardware. We
implement this through a two-stage approach: First training a network to
predict voxel occupancies from posed images and associated depth maps, then
computing features and performing volume rendering only in voxels with
sufficiently high occupancy estimates. To support this sparse representation,
we developed custom algorithms for efficient sampling, feature aggregation, and
querying from sparse volumes-overcoming the dense-volume assumptions inherent
in existing works. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our approach
reduces storage requirements by more than 50 times without performance
degradation, enabling reconstructions at $512^3$ resolution compared to the
typical $128^3$ on similar hardware, and achieving superior reconstruction
accuracy over current state-of-the-art methods.

present Tora2, an enhanced version of Tora, which introduces several design
improvements to expand its capabilities in both appearance and motion

integrate trajectory, textual description, and visual information for each
entity. This innovation significantly reduces misalignment in multimodal
conditioning during training. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive loss that
jointly optimizes trajectory dynamics and entity consistency through explicit
mapping between motion and personalization embeddings. Tora2 is, to our best
knowledge, the first method to achieve simultaneous multi-entity customization
of appearance and motion for video generation. Experimental results demonstrate
that Tora2 achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art customization
methods while providing advanced motion control capabilities, which marks a
critical advancement in multi-condition video generation. Project page:

TL;DR: T-LoRA提出了一种时间步依赖的低秩适应框架，用于扩散模型的单图像定制，解决了过拟合问题，提升了生成多样性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在单图像定制时容易过拟合，限制了生成多样性和泛化能力。

Method: T-LoRA采用动态调优策略和权重参数化技术，根据时间步调整低秩更新，确保适配器组件的独立性。

Result: T-LoRA在概念保真度和文本对齐方面优于标准LoRA和其他方法。

Conclusion: T-LoRA在数据有限和资源受限的场景中具有潜力。

Abstract: While diffusion model fine-tuning offers a powerful approach for customizing
pre-trained models to generate specific objects, it frequently suffers from
overfitting when training samples are limited, compromising both generalization
capability and output diversity. This paper tackles the challenging yet most
impactful task of adapting a diffusion model using just a single concept image,
as single-image customization holds the greatest practical potential. We
introduce T-LoRA, a Timestep-Dependent Low-Rank Adaptation framework
specifically designed for diffusion model personalization. In our work we show
that higher diffusion timesteps are more prone to overfitting than lower ones,
necessitating a timestep-sensitive fine-tuning strategy. T-LoRA incorporates
two key innovations: (1) a dynamic fine-tuning strategy that adjusts
rank-constrained updates based on diffusion timesteps, and (2) a weight
parametrization technique that ensures independence between adapter components
through orthogonal initialization. Extensive experiments show that T-LoRA and
its individual components outperform standard LoRA and other diffusion model
personalization techniques. They achieve a superior balance between concept
fidelity and text alignment, highlighting the potential of T-LoRA in
data-limited and resource-constrained scenarios. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有CIR方法依赖昂贵人工标注三元组的问题，提升可扩展性和零样本能力。

Method: 利用LLM生成多样提示，控制文本到图像生成模型生成图像对，构建CIRHS数据集；提出CoAlign框架实现全局对齐和局部推理。

Result: 在三个基准测试中表现出色，首次证明完全合成数据集训练CIR模型的可行性；监督训练下超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法和框架有效，合成数据集和CoAlign为CIR任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: As a challenging vision-language (VL) task, Composed Image Retrieval (CIR)
aims to retrieve target images using multimodal (image+text) queries. Although
many existing CIR methods have attained promising performance, their reliance
on costly, manually labeled triplets hinders scalability and zero-shot
capability. To address this issue, we propose a scalable pipeline for automatic
triplet generation, along with a fully synthetic dataset named Composed Image
Retrieval on High-quality Synthetic Triplets (CIRHS). Our pipeline leverages a
large language model (LLM) to generate diverse prompts, controlling a
text-to-image generative model to produce image pairs with identical elements
in each pair, which are then filtered and reorganized to form the CIRHS
dataset. In addition, we introduce Hybrid Contextual Alignment (CoAlign), a
novel CIR framework, which can accomplish global alignment and local reasoning
within a broader context, enabling the model to learn more robust and
informative representations. By utilizing the synthetic CIRHS dataset, CoAlign
achieves outstanding zero-shot performance on three commonly used benchmarks,
demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of training CIR models on a
fully synthetic dataset. Furthermore, under supervised training, our method
outperforms all the state-of-the-art supervised CIR approaches, validating the
effectiveness of our proposed retrieval framework. The code and the CIRHS
dataset will be released soon.

Motivation: 部分多标签学习需要从不完全标注的数据中提取知识，核心挑战在于准确识别标签与实例之间的模糊关系。

Method: SCINet引入双主导提示模块和跨模态融合模块，结合多模态模型捕捉文本-图像相关性，并通过语义增强策略提升模型对数据语义的理解。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，SCINet优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SCINet通过语义共现模式和跨模态融合，有效解决了部分多标签学习中的核心挑战。

Abstract: Partial multi-label learning aims to extract knowledge from incompletely
annotated data, which includes known correct labels, known incorrect labels,
and unknown labels. The core challenge lies in accurately identifying the
ambiguous relationships between labels and instances. In this paper, we
emphasize that matching co-occurrence patterns between labels and instances is
key to addressing this challenge. To this end, we propose Semantic
Co-occurrence Insight Network (SCINet), a novel and effective framework for
partial multi-label learning. Specifically, SCINet introduces a bi-dominant
prompter module, which leverages an off-the-shelf multimodal model to capture
text-image correlations and enhance semantic alignment. To reinforce
instance-label interdependencies, we develop a cross-modality fusion module
that jointly models inter-label correlations, inter-instance relationships, and
co-occurrence patterns across instance-label assignments. Moreover, we propose
an intrinsic semantic augmentation strategy that enhances the model's
understanding of intrinsic data semantics by applying diverse image
transformations, thereby fostering a synergistic relationship between label
confidence and sample difficulty. Extensive experiments on four widely-used
benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCINet surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Machine learning-based Deepfake detection models have achieved impressive
results on benchmark datasets, yet their performance often deteriorates
significantly when evaluated on out-of-distribution data. In this work, we
investigate an ensemble-based approach for improving the generalization of
deepfake detection systems across diverse datasets. Building on a recent
open-source benchmark, we combine prediction probabilities from several
state-of-the-art asymmetric models proposed at top venues. Our experiments span
two distinct out-of-domain datasets and demonstrate that no single model
consistently outperforms others across settings. In contrast, ensemble-based
predictions provide more stable and reliable performance in all scenarios. Our
results suggest that asymmetric ensembling offers a robust and scalable
solution for real-world deepfake detection where prior knowledge of forgery
type or quality is often unavailable.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于点云与卫星图像对齐的结构化地理配准方法，解决了GNSS信号缺失区域的定位问题，显著提升了精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GNSS信号缺失的密集城市区域，现有方法依赖实时GNSS和IMU数据，但易因定位不稳定导致误差。

Method: 使用预训练Point Transformer分割道路点，提取道路骨架和交叉点进行全局刚性对齐，再通过RBF插值局部优化，并结合SRTM数据进行高程校正。

Result: 在KITTI和Perth数据集上，平面配准精度分别提升55.3%和77.4%，高程相关性分别提升30.5%和50.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需依赖先验定位信息，能有效恢复GNSS信息并重建城市规模3D地图，适用于复杂城市环境。

Abstract: Accurate geo-registration of LiDAR point clouds presents significant
challenges in GNSS signal denied urban areas with high-rise buildings and
bridges. Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and IMU data, that
require pre-calibration and assume stable positioning during data collection.
However, this assumption often fails in dense urban areas, resulting in
localization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration
and spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite
images, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of
city scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization. The proposed approach
employs a pre-trained Point Transformer model to segment the road points and
then extracts the road skeleton and intersection points from the point cloud as
well as the target map for alignment. Global rigid alignment of the two is
performed using the intersection points, followed by local refinement using
radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation correction is then applied
to the point cloud based on terrain information from SRTM dataset to resolve
vertical discrepancies. The proposed method was tested on the popular KITTI
benchmark and a locally collected Perth (Western Australia) CBD dataset. On the
KITTI dataset, our method achieved an average planimetric alignment standard
deviation (STD) of 0.84~m across sequences with intersections, representing a
55.3\% improvement over the original dataset. On the Perth dataset, which lacks
GNSS information, our method achieved an average STD of 0.96~m compared to the
GPS data extracted from Google Maps API. This corresponds to a 77.4\%
improvement from the initial alignment. Our method also resulted in elevation
correlation gains of 30.5\% on the KITTI dataset and 50.4\% on the Perth
dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在生成图像时无法生成可读、正确拼写的文本，限制了其在广告、学习和创意设计等实际应用中的使用。

Method: GCDA框架通过双流文本编码器、字符感知注意力机制和OCR微调阶段，改进了扩散模型。

Result: 实验表明，GCDA在文本渲染（字符错误率0.08 vs 0.21）、人类感知和图像合成质量（FID 14.3）上均达到最新水平。

Conclusion: GCDA显著提升了文本到图像模型生成可读文本的能力，为实际应用提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: The modern text-to-image diffusion models boom has opened a new era in
digital content production as it has proven the previously unseen ability to
produce photorealistic and stylistically diverse imagery based on the semantics
of natural-language descriptions. However, the consistent disadvantage of these
models is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled
text in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical
purposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces
a new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware
Attention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three
well-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder
that encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph
representations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input
text that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of
the character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to
limit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to
avoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning
phase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be
legible and accurately spell. Large scale experiments to benchmark datasets,
such as MARIO-10M and T2I-CompBench, reveal that GCDA sets a new
state-of-the-art on all metrics, with better character based metrics on text
rendering (Character Error Rate: 0.08 vs 0.21 for the previous best; Word Error
Rate: 0.15 vs 0.25), human perception, and comparable image synthesis quality
on high-fidelity (FID: 14.3).

Motivation: 现有方法依赖网格域，无法充分利用2D计算机视觉和图形学的快速视觉创新，因此需要一种新方法来弥补这一差距。

Method: 使用光真实感可微分渲染，并通过预训练的视觉自动语音识别模型监督训练，引入感知唇读损失。

Result: 在MEAD数据集上，Lip Vertex Error指标提升了56.1%，同时保持了网格驱动动画的可控性。

Conclusion: VisualSpeaker通过感知焦点支持准确的口型，为手语虚拟人等应用提供了重要线索。

Abstract: Realistic, high-fidelity 3D facial animations are crucial for expressive
avatar systems in human-computer interaction and accessibility. Although prior
methods show promising quality, their reliance on the mesh domain limits their
ability to fully leverage the rapid visual innovations seen in 2D computer
vision and graphics. We propose VisualSpeaker, a novel method that bridges this
gap using photorealistic differentiable rendering, supervised by visual speech
recognition, for improved 3D facial animation. Our contribution is a perceptual
lip-reading loss, derived by passing photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting
avatar renders through a pre-trained Visual Automatic Speech Recognition model
during training. Evaluation on the MEAD dataset demonstrates that VisualSpeaker
improves both the standard Lip Vertex Error metric by 56.1% and the perceptual
quality of the generated animations, while retaining the controllability of
mesh-driven animation. This perceptual focus naturally supports accurate
mouthings, essential cues that disambiguate similar manual signs in sign
language avatars.

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation aims to generate synchronized lip
movements and vivid facial expressions. However, most existing approaches focus
on static and predefined emotion labels, limiting their diversity and
naturalness. To address these challenges, we propose MEDTalk, a novel framework
for fine-grained and dynamic emotional talking head generation. Our approach
first disentangles content and emotion embedding spaces from motion sequences
using a carefully designed cross-reconstruction process, enabling independent
control over lip movements and facial expressions. Beyond conventional
audio-driven lip synchronization, we integrate audio and speech text,
predicting frame-wise intensity variations and dynamically adjusting static
emotion features to generate realistic emotional expressions. Furthermore, to
enhance control and personalization, we incorporate multimodal inputs-including
text descriptions and reference expression images-to guide the generation of
user-specified facial expressions. With MetaHuman as the priority, our
generated results can be conveniently integrated into the industrial production
pipeline.

Result: 在BDD-X和CoVLA数据集上，MCAM在视觉-语言因果关系学习上达到SOTA性能，并展示了在视频序列中捕捉因果特征的优越能力。

Conclusion: MCAM在自动驾驶应用中表现出高效性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate driving behavior recognition and reasoning are critical for
autonomous driving video understanding. However, existing methods often tend to
dig out the shallow causal, fail to address spurious correlations across
modalities, and ignore the ego-vehicle level causality modeling. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Causal Analysis Model (MCAM)
that constructs latent causal structures between visual and language
modalities. Firstly, we design a multi-level feature extractor to capture
long-range dependencies. Secondly, we design a causal analysis module that
dynamically models driving scenarios using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of
driving states. Thirdly, we utilize a vision-language transformer to align
critical visual features with their corresponding linguistic expressions.
Extensive experiments on the BDD-X, and CoVLA datasets demonstrate that MCAM
achieves SOTA performance in visual-language causal relationship learning.
Furthermore, the model exhibits superior capability in capturing causal
characteristics within video sequences, showcasing its effectiveness for
autonomous driving applications. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在多模态理解上表现优秀，但在区分视觉相似但文化背景不同的概念时存在困难，主要原因是缺乏高质量文化特定数据集和上下文知识。

Method: 设计了数据合成流程构建CulTwin数据集，并通过定制对比学习微调CLIP，生成CultureCLIP模型。

Result: CultureCLIP在文化相关基准测试中表现优于基础CLIP，某些任务上细粒度概念识别提升5.49%，同时保留了CLIP的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 数据合成和模型微调方法能有效捕捉文化细微差异，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel in multimodal
understanding but struggle with contextually relevant fine-grained visual
features, making it difficult to distinguish visually similar yet culturally
distinct concepts. This limitation stems from the scarcity of high-quality
culture-specific datasets, the lack of integrated contextual knowledge, and the
absence of hard negatives highlighting subtle distinctions. To address these
challenges, we first design a data curation pipeline that leverages
open-sourced VLMs and text-to-image diffusion models to construct CulTwin, a
synthetic cultural dataset. This dataset consists of paired
concept-caption-image triplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but
represent different cultural contexts. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to
create CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced
captions and synthetic images through customized contrastive learning, enabling
finer cultural differentiation while preserving generalization capabilities.
Experiments on culturally relevant benchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms
the base CLIP, achieving up to a notable 5.49% improvement in fine-grained
concept recognition on certain tasks, while preserving CLIP's original
generalization ability, validating the effectiveness of our data synthesis and
VLM backbone training paradigm in capturing subtle cultural distinctions.

Abstract: Recovering a 3D surface from its surface normal map, a problem known as
normal integration, is a key component for photometric shape reconstruction
techniques such as shape-from-shading and photometric stereo. The vast majority
of existing approaches for normal integration handle only implicitly the
presence of depth discontinuities and are limited to orthographic or ideal
pinhole cameras. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation that allows
modeling discontinuities explicitly and handling generic central cameras. Our
key idea is based on a local planarity assumption, that we model through
constraints between surface normals and ray directions. Compared to existing
methods, our approach more accurately approximates the relation between depth
and surface normals, achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard normal
integration benchmark, and is the first to directly handle generic central
camera models.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning across various domains, it remains
vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although many existing adversarial attack
methods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\ell_{p}$-norm
perturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual
capabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward
generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based
approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to
instability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed
for UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation
injection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In
this paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on
diffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable
adversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution
towards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map
to inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated
samples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of
natural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but
also retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA
datasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in
both black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv
achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality. Furthermore,
the dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables
ScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures.

Abstract: In recent years, affective computing and its applications have become a
fast-growing research topic. Despite significant advancements, the lack of
affective multi-modal datasets remains a major bottleneck in developing
accurate emotion recognition systems. Furthermore, the use of contact-based
devices during emotion elicitation often unintentionally influences the
emotional experience, reducing or altering the genuine spontaneous emotional
response. This limitation highlights the need for methods capable of extracting
affective cues from multiple modalities without physical contact, such as
remote physiological emotion recognition. To address this, we present the
Contactless Affective States Through Physiological Signals Database
(CAST-Phys), a novel high-quality dataset explicitly designed for multi-modal
remote physiological emotion recognition using facial and physiological cues.
The dataset includes diverse physiological signals, such as
photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and respiration rate
(RR), alongside high-resolution uncompressed facial video recordings, enabling
the potential for remote signal recovery. Our analysis highlights the crucial
role of physiological signals in realistic scenarios where facial expressions
alone may not provide sufficient emotional information. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the potential of remote multi-modal emotion recognition by
evaluating the impact of individual and fused modalities, showcasing its
effectiveness in advancing contactless emotion recognition technologies.

Abstract: Accurately rendering scenes with reflective surfaces remains a significant
challenge in novel view synthesis, as existing methods like Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often misinterpret reflections
as physical geometry, resulting in degraded reconstructions. Previous methods
rely on incomplete and non-generalizable geometric constraints, leading to
misalignment between the positions of Gaussian splats and the actual scene
geometry. When dealing with real-world scenes containing complex geometry, the
accumulation of Gaussians further exacerbates surface artifacts and results in
blurred reconstructions. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose
Ref-Unlock, a novel geometry-aware reflection modeling framework based on 3D
Gaussian Splatting, which explicitly disentangles transmitted and reflected
components to better capture complex reflections and enhance geometric
consistency in real-world scenes. Our approach employs a dual-branch
representation with high-order spherical harmonics to capture high-frequency
reflective details, alongside a reflection removal module providing pseudo
reflection-free supervision to guide clean decomposition. Additionally, we
incorporate pseudo-depth maps and a geometry-aware bilateral smoothness
constraint to enhance 3D geometric consistency and stability in decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ref-Unlock significantly outperforms
classical GS-based reflection methods and achieves competitive results with
NeRF-based models, while enabling flexible vision foundation models (VFMs)
driven reflection editing. Our method thus offers an efficient and
generalizable solution for realistic rendering of reflective scenes. Our code

TL;DR: Omni-Video是一个统一的视频理解、生成和基于指令编辑的高效框架，通过多模态大语言模型生成连续视觉线索，并结合扩散解码器生成高质量视频。


<details>

Conclusion: Omni-Video为统一的视频建模提供了有效解决方案，展示了在多任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Notable breakthroughs in unified understanding and generation modeling have
led to remarkable advancements in image understanding, reasoning, production
and editing, yet current foundational models predominantly focus on processing
images, creating a gap in the development of unified models for video
understanding and generation. This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and
effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as
instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used
as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos
conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system
for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a
lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on
the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the
former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens
to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage
training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion
decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically
demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities
across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了生成图像的偏差和多样性问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Diffusion models has underpinned much recent advances of dataset augmentation
in various computer vision tasks. However, when involving generating
multi-object images as real scenarios, most existing methods either rely
entirely on text condition, resulting in a deviation between the generated
objects and the original data, or rely too much on the original images,
resulting in a lack of diversity in the generated images, which is of limited
help to downstream tasks. To mitigate both problems with one stone, we propose
a prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image
augmentation. Specifically, we introduce a local-global semantic fusion
strategy to extract semantics from images to replace text, and inject knowledge
into the diffusion model through LoRA to alleviate the category deviation
between the original model and the target dataset. In addition, we design a
reward model based counting loss to assist the traditional reconstruction loss
for model training. By constraining the object counts of each category instead
of pixel-by-pixel constraints, bridging the quantity deviation between the
generated data and the original data while improving the diversity of the
generated data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method over several representative state-of-the-art baselines and
showcase strong downstream task gain and out-of-domain generalization
capabilities. Code is available at

consisting of two convolutional layers, max pooling, and fully connected layers
was implemented. SoftReMish was evaluated against popular activation functions
including ReLU, Tanh, and Mish by replacing the activation function in all
trainable layers. The model performance was assessed in terms of minimum
training loss and maximum validation accuracy. Results showed that SoftReMish
achieved a minimum loss (3.14e-8) and a validation accuracy (99.41%),

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Laplace算子需要结构化域，而简单卷积核和消息传递层对边界有偏置，需更通用的平滑方法。

Method: 引入一类平滑算子，通过对称Sinkhorn算法归一化为扩散类算子，保留Laplacian特性。

Result: 算子近似热扩散，保留Laplacian的谱信息，适用于点云等不规则数据。

Conclusion: 方法为不规则数据提供了Laplacian类平滑和处理能力，适用于形状分析等应用。

Abstract: Smoothing a signal based on local neighborhoods is a core operation in
machine learning and geometry processing. On well-structured domains such as
vector spaces and manifolds, the Laplace operator derived from differential
geometry offers a principled approach to smoothing via heat diffusion, with
strong theoretical guarantees. However, constructing such Laplacians requires a
carefully defined domain structure, which is not always available. Most
practitioners thus rely on simple convolution kernels and message-passing
layers, which are biased against the boundaries of the domain. We bridge this
gap by introducing a broad class of smoothing operators, derived from general
similarity or adjacency matrices, and demonstrate that they can be normalized
into diffusion-like operators that inherit desirable properties from
Laplacians. Our approach relies on a symmetric variant of the Sinkhorn
algorithm, which rescales positive smoothing operators to match the structural
behavior of heat diffusion. This construction enables Laplacian-like smoothing
and processing of irregular data such as point clouds, sparse voxel grids or
mixture of Gaussians. We show that the resulting operators not only approximate
heat diffusion but also retain spectral information from the Laplacian itself,
with applications to shape analysis and matching.

TL;DR: OmniPart是一个新型框架，用于生成具有可编辑部分结构的3D对象，通过两阶段协同方法实现高语义解耦和结构一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数生成方法仅能生成单一形状的3D资产，限制了交互应用的实用性，因此需要一种能够生成具有明确部分结构的3D对象的方法。

Method: OmniPart采用两阶段方法：1）自回归结构规划模块生成可控的3D部分边界框；2）空间条件修正流模型在规划布局内同时合成所有3D部分。

Result: 实验表明，OmniPart在性能上达到最先进水平，支持用户定义的部分粒度、精确定位和多样化下游应用。

Conclusion: OmniPart为更可解释、可编辑和通用的3D内容铺平了道路。

Abstract: The creation of 3D assets with explicit, editable part structures is crucial
for advancing interactive applications, yet most generative methods produce
only monolithic shapes, limiting their utility. We introduce OmniPart, a novel
framework for part-aware 3D object generation designed to achieve high semantic
decoupling among components while maintaining robust structural cohesion.
OmniPart uniquely decouples this complex task into two synergistic stages: (1)
an autoregressive structure planning module generates a controllable,
variable-length sequence of 3D part bounding boxes, critically guided by
flexible 2D part masks that allow for intuitive control over part decomposition
without requiring direct correspondences or semantic labels; and (2) a
spatially-conditioned rectified flow model, efficiently adapted from a
pre-trained holistic 3D generator, synthesizes all 3D parts simultaneously and
consistently within the planned layout. Our approach supports user-defined part
granularity, precise localization, and enables diverse downstream applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniPart achieves state-of-the-art
performance, paving the way for more interpretable, editable, and versatile 3D
content.

Abstract: Technical reports and articles often contain valuable information in the form
of semi-structured data like charts, and figures. Interpreting these and using
the information from them is essential for downstream tasks such as question
answering (QA). Current approaches to visual question answering often struggle
with the precision required for scientific data interpretation, particularly in
handling numerical values, multi-step reasoning over visual elements, and
maintaining consistency between visual observation and textual reasoning. We
present our approach to the SciVQA 2025 shared task, focusing on answering
visual and non-visual questions grounded in scientific figures from scholarly
articles.
  We conducted a series of experiments using models with 5B to 8B parameters.
Our strongest individual model, InternVL3, achieved ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L F1
scores of \textbf{0.740} and a BERTScore of \textbf{0.983} on the SciVQA test
split. We also developed an ensemble model with multiple vision language models
(VLMs). Through error analysis on the validation split, our ensemble approach
improved performance compared to most individual models, though InternVL3
remained the strongest standalone performer. Our findings underscore the
effectiveness of prompt optimization, chain-of-thought reasoning and ensemble
modeling in improving the model's ability in visual question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义场景补全方法依赖昂贵的地面真实标注，限制了其应用范围。本文旨在通过无监督方法解决这一问题。

Method: SceneDINO结合自监督表示学习和2D无监督场景理解技术，通过多视角一致性自监督训练，无需语义或几何标注。采用3D特征蒸馏方法提取无监督3D语义。

Result: SceneDINO在3D和2D无监督场景理解中达到最先进的分割精度，线性探测3D特征与当前监督方法相当，并展示了领域泛化和多视角一致性。

Conclusion: SceneDINO为单图像3D场景理解提供了强大的基础，展示了无监督方法的潜力。

Abstract: Semantic scene completion (SSC) aims to infer both the 3D geometry and
semantics of a scene from single images. In contrast to prior work on SSC that
heavily relies on expensive ground-truth annotations, we approach SSC in an
unsupervised setting. Our novel method, SceneDINO, adapts techniques from
self-supervised representation learning and 2D unsupervised scene understanding
to SSC. Our training exclusively utilizes multi-view consistency
self-supervision without any form of semantic or geometric ground truth. Given
a single input image, SceneDINO infers the 3D geometry and expressive 3D DINO
features in a feed-forward manner. Through a novel 3D feature distillation
approach, we obtain unsupervised 3D semantics. In both 3D and 2D unsupervised
scene understanding, SceneDINO reaches state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy.
Linear probing our 3D features matches the segmentation accuracy of a current
supervised SSC approach. Additionally, we showcase the domain generalization
and multi-view consistency of SceneDINO, taking the first steps towards a
strong foundation for single image 3D scene understanding.

TL;DR: RSRefSeg 2提出了一种解耦的双阶段框架，通过粗定位和精细分割改进遥感图像分割的精度和语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂语义关系和跨模态对齐时存在局限性，主要原因是目标定位与边界划分的耦合处理机制。

Method: 采用CLIP和SAM的协作，通过双模态编码和级联二阶提示器优化语义提示，指导SAM生成像素级精细掩码。

Result: 实验表明，RSRefSeg 2在分割精度（gIoU提升约3%）和复杂语义解释上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RSRefSeg 2通过解耦设计和基础模型协作，显著提升了遥感图像分割的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation provides a flexible and
fine-grained framework for remote sensing scene analysis via vision-language
collaborative interpretation. Current approaches predominantly utilize a
three-stage pipeline encompassing dual-modal encoding, cross-modal interaction,
and pixel decoding. These methods demonstrate significant limitations in
managing complex semantic relationships and achieving precise cross-modal
alignment, largely due to their coupled processing mechanism that conflates
target localization with boundary delineation. This architectural coupling
amplifies error propagation under semantic ambiguity while restricting model
generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose
RSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow
into a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine
segmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with
SAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model
collaboration. Specifically, CLIP is employed as the dual-modal encoder to
activate target features within its pre-aligned semantic space and generate
localization prompts. To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in
multi-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order
prompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via
decomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces. These
optimized semantic prompts subsequently direct the SAM to generate pixel-level
refined masks, thereby completing the semantic transmission pipeline. Extensive
experiments (RefSegRS, RRSIS-D, and RISBench) demonstrate that RSRefSeg 2
surpasses contemporary methods in segmentation accuracy (+~3% gIoU) and complex
semantic interpretation. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类运动的复杂性为点跟踪提供了丰富的监督信号，但人工标注数据获取困难。

Method: 通过SMPL模型拟合视频中的人体，生成伪轨迹，处理遮挡并过滤不可靠轨迹。

Result: 在TAP-Vid基准测试中达到SOTA性能，数据量和计算资源需求大幅降低。

Conclusion: AnthroTAP为点跟踪任务提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Human motion, with its inherent complexities, such as non-rigid deformations,
articulated movements, clothing distortions, and frequent occlusions caused by
limbs or other individuals, provides a rich and challenging source of
supervision that is crucial for training robust and generalizable point
trackers. Despite the suitability of human motion, acquiring extensive training
data for point tracking remains difficult due to laborious manual annotation.
Our proposed pipeline, AnthroTAP, addresses this by proposing an automated
pipeline to generate pseudo-labeled training data, leveraging the Skinned
Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model. We first fit the SMPL model to detected
humans in video frames, project the resulting 3D mesh vertices onto 2D image
planes to generate pseudo-trajectories, handle occlusions using ray-casting,
and filter out unreliable tracks based on optical flow consistency. A point
tracking model trained on AnthroTAP annotated dataset achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the TAP-Vid benchmark, surpassing other models trained on real
videos while using 10,000 times less data and only 1 day in 4 GPUs, compared to
256 GPUs used in recent state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在句子级归因上表现不足，无法满足用户对特定关键词（如数字、年份、名称）的归因需求。

Method: 结合Shapley值和KNN检索技术，利用预计算数据存储进行上下文检索，量化token重要性。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，TokenShapley在token级归因上优于现有方法，准确率提升11-23%。

Conclusion: TokenShapley为LLM生成响应的细粒度数据归因提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in in-context
learning, but verifying the correctness of their generated responses remains a
challenge. Prior work has explored attribution at the sentence level, but these
methods fall short when users seek attribution for specific keywords within the
response, such as numbers, years, or names. To address this limitation, we
propose TokenShapley, a novel token-level attribution method that combines
Shapley value-based data attribution with KNN-based retrieval techniques
inspired by recent advances in KNN-augmented LLMs. By leveraging a precomputed
datastore for contextual retrieval and computing Shapley values to quantify
token importance, TokenShapley provides a fine-grained data attribution
approach. Extensive evaluations on four benchmarks show that TokenShapley
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in token-level attribution, achieving an
11-23% improvement in accuracy.

Motivation: 由于数据污染问题，衡量大语言模型的泛化能力具有挑战性，传统任务不适合评估。

Method: 提出用户行为预测框架，并在电影和音乐推荐数据集上测试GPT-4o、GPT-4o-mini和Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct。

Result: GPT-4o表现优于其他模型，但所有模型仍有改进空间，尤其是Llama。

Conclusion: 用户行为预测是衡量大语言模型泛化能力的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Measuring the generalization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
challenging due to data contamination. As models grow and computation becomes
cheaper, ensuring tasks and test cases are unseen during training phases will
become nearly impossible. We argue that knowledge-retrieval and reasoning tasks
are not ideal for measuring generalization, as LLMs are not trained for
specific tasks. Instead, we propose user behavior prediction, also a key aspect
of personalization, as a theoretically sound, scalable, and robust alternative.
We introduce a novel framework for this approach and test it on movie and music
recommendation datasets for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.
Results align with our framework's predictions, showing GPT-4o outperforms
GPT-4o-mini and Llama, though all models have much room for improvement,
especially Llama.

Result: 在EXIST2021和MLSC数据集上，ASCEND平均Macro F1分别提升9.86%、29.63%和32.51%。

Conclusion: ASCEND能有效捕捉隐性性别歧视的细微特征，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The global reach of social media has amplified the spread of hateful content,
including implicit sexism, which is often overlooked by conventional detection
methods. In this work, we introduce an Adaptive Supervised Contrastive lEarning
framework for implicit sexism detectioN (ASCEND). A key innovation of our
method is the incorporation of threshold-based contrastive learning: by
computing cosine similarities between embeddings, we selectively treat only
those sample pairs as positive if their similarity exceeds a learnable
threshold. This mechanism refines the embedding space by robustly pulling
together representations of semantically similar texts while pushing apart
dissimilar ones, thus reducing false positives and negatives. The final
classification is achieved by jointly optimizing a contrastive loss with a
cross-entropy loss. Textual features are enhanced through a word-level
attention module. Additionally, we employ sentiment, emotion, and toxicity
features. Evaluations on the EXIST2021 and MLSC datasets demonstrate that
ASCEND significantly outperforms existing methods, with average Macro F1
improvements of 9.86%, 29.63%, and 32.51% across multiple tasks, highlighting
its efficacy in capturing the subtle cues of implicit sexist language.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅预测辍学风险，还提供可操作的干预策略，为全球教育系统提供可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Student dropout in distance learning remains a critical challenge, with
profound societal and economic consequences. While classical machine learning
models leverage structured socio-demographic and behavioral data, they often
fail to capture the nuanced emotional and contextual factors embedded in
unstructured student interactions. This paper introduces a transformative AI
framework that redefines dropout prediction through three synergistic
innovations: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for domain-specific sentiment
analysis, prompt engineering to decode academic stressors, and cross-modal
attention fusion to dynamically align textual, behavioral, and
socio-demographic insights. By grounding sentiment analysis in a curated
knowledge base of pedagogical content, our RAG-enhanced BERT model interprets
student comments with unprecedented contextual relevance, while optimized
prompts isolate indicators of academic distress (e.g., "isolation," "workload
anxiety"). A cross-modal attention layer then fuses these insights with
temporal engagement patterns, creating holistic risk profiles. Evaluated on a
longitudinal dataset of 4 423 students, the framework achieves 89% accuracy and
an F1-score of 0.88, outperforming conventional models by 7% and reducing false
negatives by 21%. Beyond prediction, the system generates interpretable
interventions by retrieving contextually aligned strategies (e.g., mentorship
programs for isolated learners). This work bridges the gap between predictive
analytics and actionable pedagogy, offering a scalable solution to mitigate
dropout risks in global education systems

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
automated discharge summary generation, they still suffer from hallucination
issues, such as generating inaccurate content or fabricating information
without valid sources. In addition, electronic medical records (EMRs) typically
consist of long-form data, making it challenging for LLMs to attribute the
generated content to the sources. To address these challenges, we propose LCDS,
a Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary generation system. LCDS constructs a
source mapping table by calculating textual similarity between EMRs and
discharge summaries to constrain the scope of summarized content. Moreover,
LCDS incorporates a comprehensive set of logical rules, enabling it to generate
more reliable silver discharge summaries tailored to different clinical fields.
Furthermore, LCDS supports source attribution for generated content, allowing
experts to efficiently review, provide feedback, and rectify errors. The
resulting golden discharge summaries are subsequently recorded for incremental
fine-tuning of LLMs. Our project and demo video are in the GitHub repository

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对特定任务和领域微调的语言模型专家增多，需要高效选择和组合方法。

explore scenarios where additional data is available, demonstrating LAG's
compatibility with alternative solutions such as retrieval-augmented generation

TL;DR: 研究发现，在大型语言模型中，训练时使用低效但连贯的推理轨迹（而非最优轨迹）能提升泛化能力，这与模型的预测置信度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究推理轨迹的结构和冗余对大型语言模型泛化能力的影响。

Method: 通过最短路径任务训练解码器变换器，比较最优动态规划轨迹与低效回溯轨迹的效果。

Result: 使用低效但连贯的轨迹训练的模型泛化能力更强，且与预测置信度相关。

Conclusion: 长、连贯且局部递增的推理轨迹更易于优化训练信号，提升泛化性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing highlight two key factors for
improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs): (i) allocating more
test-time compute tends to help on harder problems but often introduces
redundancy in the reasoning trace, and (ii) compute is most effective when
reasoning is systematic and incremental, forming structured chains of thought
(CoTs) akin to human problem-solving. To study these factors in isolation, we
introduce a controlled setting based on shortest-path tasks in layered graphs.
We train decoder-only transformers on question-trace-answer triples using a
custom tokenizer, comparing models trained on optimal bottom-up dynamic
programming traces with those trained on longer, valid traces involving
backtracking. Surprisingly, with the same training-token budget, models trained
on inefficient traces generalize better to unseen graphs. This benefit is not
due to length alone-injecting arbitrary redundancy into reasoning traces fails
to help and can even hurt performance. Instead, we find that generalization
correlates with the model's confidence in next-token prediction, suggesting
that long, coherent, and locally incremental traces make the training signal
easier to optimize.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用文本标注工具难以处理教育对话的复杂性，如多样化的师生互动和教学特征标注。

Result: 工具开源且提供演示视频，支持标注可靠性的提升。

Conclusion: EduCoder为教育对话研究提供了高效、可靠的标注解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce EduCoder, a domain-specialized tool designed to support
utterance-level annotation of educational dialogue. While general-purpose text
annotation tools for NLP and qualitative research abound, few address the
complexities of coding education dialogue transcripts -- with diverse
teacher-student and peer interactions. Common challenges include defining
codebooks for complex pedagogical features, supporting both open-ended and
categorical coding, and contextualizing utterances with external features, such
as the lesson's purpose and the pedagogical value of the instruction. EduCoder
is designed to address these challenges by providing a platform for researchers
and domain experts to collaboratively define complex codebooks based on
observed data. It incorporates both categorical and open-ended annotation types
along with contextual materials. Additionally, it offers a side-by-side
comparison of multiple annotators' responses, allowing comparison and
calibration of annotations with others to improve data reliability. The system
is open-source, with a demo video available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出InfoRidge框架，通过信息论分析Transformer模型中任务相关信息在训练过程中的传播，发现预测信息在上中层形成“泛化岭”，并揭示中间层在泛化中的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer模型在自然语言生成任务中表现优异，但其内部机制（尤其是任务相关信息的合成方式）仍不明确。研究旨在揭示模型各层在训练中如何影响泛化能力。

Method: 提出InfoRidge框架，通过计算隐藏表示与目标输出间的互信息，追踪任务相关信息在模型中的流动。引入残差缩放系数作为功能探针，评估各层重要性。

Result: 实验发现预测信息在上中层达到峰值（泛化岭），随后在最后一层下降，表明模型从泛化转向记忆。分布偏移时，模型更依赖中间层。

Conclusion: 中间层在Transformer模型的泛化能力中起关键作用，InfoRidge框架为理解模型内部机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in natural language generation (NLG) tasks, yet their internal mechanisms for
synthesizing task-relevant information remain insufficiently understood. While
prior studies suggest that intermediate layers often yield more generalizable
representations than final layers, how this generalization ability emerges and
propagates across layers during training remains unclear. To address this gap,
we propose InfoRidge, an information-theoretic framework, to characterize how
predictive information-the mutual information between hidden representations
and target outputs-varies across depth. Estimating this quantity enables us to
trace the flow of task-relevant information throughout the model during
training. Our experiments across various models and datasets reveal a
consistent non-monotonic trend: predictive information peaks in upper-middle
layers-forming a generalization ridge-before declining in final layers,
reflecting a transition between generalization and memorization. To further
investigate this phenomenon, we introduce residual scaling
coefficients-trainable scalar parameters applied to each residual block-which
serve as functional probes for assessing the relative importance of individual
transformer layers. These coefficients reveal that, under distribution shift,
models downweight final layers and increasingly rely on ridge layers,
highlighting their role in generalization. Together, these findings offer new
insights into the internal mechanisms of transformers and underscore the
critical role of intermediate layers in supporting generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户在使用商业LLM API时需要暴露数据给服务提供商，缺乏隐私控制。

Method: 提出隐私配置文件（自然语言指令），本地模型根据指令重写查询以隐藏敏感信息，再发送给外部模型。引入PEEP数据集支持研究。

Result: 轻量级LLM能部分遵循隐私指令，但仍有挑战，需改进模型对用户隐私偏好的理解与遵从。

Conclusion: 隐私配置文件是一种可行方法，但需进一步优化模型以实现更好的隐私保护与性能平衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are primarily accessed via commercial APIs, but
this often requires users to expose their data to service providers. In this
paper, we explore how users can stay in control of their data by using privacy
profiles: simple natural language instructions that say what should and should
not be revealed. We build a framework where a local model uses these
instructions to rewrite queries, only hiding details deemed sensitive by the
user, before sending them to an external model, thus balancing privacy with
performance. To support this research, we introduce PEEP, a multilingual
dataset of real user queries annotated to mark private content and paired with
synthetic privacy profiles. Our experiments with lightweight LLMs show they can
follow these instructions to some extent, but also face consistent challenges,
highlighting the need for models that better understand and comply with
user-defined privacy preferences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多语言任务中的推理能力不足，尤其是低资源语言，导致事实准确性、可解释性和信任度下降。

Method: 引入GeoFact-X基准，包含五种语言的标注推理轨迹；提出BRIDGE训练方法，结合监督微调和强化学习，通过语言一致性奖励对齐推理语言。

Result: BRIDGE显著提升了多语言推理的准确性，证明了推理感知的多语言强化学习对跨语言泛化的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过GeoFact-X和BRIDGE，论文展示了提升大语言模型多语言推理能力的有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in domains like
mathematics, factual QA, and code generation, yet their multilingual reasoning
capabilities in these tasks remain underdeveloped. Especially for low-resource
languages such as Swahili or Thai, LLMs can often misinterpret prompts or
default to reasoning in English. This implicit bias toward high-resource
languages undermines factual accuracy, interpretability, and trust. Current
multilingual benchmarks focus only on final answers, overlooking whether models
actually reason in the target language. To address this gap, we introduce
GeoFact-X, a geography-based multilingual factual reasoning benchmark with
annotated reasoning traces in five languages: English, Hindi, Japanese,
Swahili, and Thai. We further propose BRIDGE, a novel training method that
guides supervised fine-tuning and test-time reinforcement learning with a
language-consistency reward to align reasoning with the input language.
Finally, we develop an automatic evaluation protocol using LLM-as-a-judge to
assess answer correctness and the quality and language consistency of reasoning
traces, enabling nuanced and scalable analysis beyond surface-level metrics.
Our results show that BRIDGE significantly enhances multilingual reasoning
fidelity, demonstrating that reasoning-aware multilingual reinforcement
learning is crucial for robust cross-lingual generalization.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型如何优先和整合上下文知识与参数知识，填补研究空白。

Method: 引入CoPE框架和MultiWikiAtomic数据集，分析模型在开放问答中的表现，研究“lost-in-the-later”现象和CoT提示的影响。

Result: 发现模型存在位置偏见，CoT提示导致上下文利用减少，并设计提示方法改善上下文利用。

Conclusion: CoPE框架揭示了模型整合知识的机制，提示方法可提升事实依据，减少幻觉。

Abstract: Large language models are capable of leveraging both contextual and
parametric knowledge but how they prioritize and integrate these sources
remains underexplored. We introduce CoPE, a novel evaluation framework that
systematically measures contextual knowledge (CK) and parametric knowledge (PK)
across models and languages. Using our MultiWikiAtomic dataset in English,
Spanish, and Danish, we analyze how large language models (LLMs) integrate
context, prioritize information, and incorporate PK in open-ended question
answering. Our analysis uncovers a phenomenon we call lost-in-the-later, where
LLMs tend to overlook or deprioritize information that appears later in a given
context, revealing a strong positional bias that affects contextual grounding.
We further find that reasoning models, as well as non-reasoning models prompted
with chain-of-thought (CoT), use context even less than non-reasoning models
without CoT and fail to mitigate the lost-in-the-later effect. CoT prompting,
in particular, results in lower recall and shorter responses, leading to
degraded contextual grounding. Based on these insights, we design prompt-based
methods to effectively leverage input context. A case study applying CoPE to
summarization demonstrates that CK-informed prompting improves factual
grounding and reduces hallucination.

Motivation: 探讨性别和地方背景如何交互影响堕胎议题的公众讨论，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 基于近1000万条X（原Twitter）上推断性别、意识形态和位置的堕胎相关帖子进行分析。

Result: 性别显著调节堕胎态度和情感表达，尤其在保守地区；Dobbs案草案泄露进一步动员了支持堕胎的女性。

Conclusion: 堕胎讨论不仅意识形态极化，还深受性别和地方影响，突显身份在制度动荡时塑造政治表达的核心作用。

Abstract: The U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health
Organization marked a turning point in the national debate over reproductive
rights. While the ideological divide over abortion is well documented, less is
known about how gender and local sociopolitical contexts interact to shape
public discourse. Drawing on nearly 10 million abortion-related posts on X
(formerly Twitter) from users with inferred gender, ideology and location, we
show that gender significantly moderates abortion attitudes and emotional
expression, particularly in conservative regions, and independently of
ideology. This creates a gender gap in abortion attitudes that grows more
pronounced in conservative regions. The leak of the Dobbs draft opinion further
intensified online engagement, disproportionately mobilizing pro-abortion women
in areas where access was under threat. These findings reveal that abortion
discourse is not only ideologically polarized but also deeply structured by
gender and place, highlighting the central role of identity in shaping
political expression during moments of institutional disruption.

Motivation: 解决L2学习者在学习类型差异大的语言（如英语和韩语）时词汇习得的困难，尤其是针对非英语母语者的需求。

Method: 开发PhoniTale系统，利用LLM基于语音相似性生成L1关键词序列的助记词，并通过自动指标和人工评估验证其效果。

Result: PhoniTale的表现与人工生成的助记词相当，短期记忆测试显示其有效性。

Conclusion: PhoniTale为L2词汇学习提供了有效工具，但需进一步改进助记词质量和生成方法。

Abstract: Vocabulary acquisition poses a significant challenge for second-language (L2)
learners, especially when learning typologically distant languages such as
English and Korean, where phonological and structural mismatches complicate
vocabulary learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to
generate keyword mnemonics by leveraging similar keywords from a learner's
first language (L1) to aid in acquiring L2 vocabulary. However, most of this
research has focused on native English speakers learning other languages,
rather than the reverse. In this paper, we present PhoniTale, a novel
cross-lingual mnemonic generation system that retrieves L1 keyword sequence
based on phonological similarity and uses LLMs to generate mnemonics. We
evaluate PhoniTale using both automated metrics and human evaluations,
comparing its output to mnemonics created by humans and by previous automated
approaches. To assess practical effectiveness, we also conduct a short-term
recall test measuring mnemonic helpfulness. Our findings show that PhoniTale
performs comparably to human-authored mnemonics. We also highlight key areas
for future improvement in mnemonic quality and methodology.

Conclusion: LLMs的语义能力存在争议，需更深入的理论与实践结合研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT demonstrated the potential to
replicate human language abilities through technology, ranging from text
generation to engaging in conversations. However, it remains controversial to
what extent these systems truly understand language. We examine this issue by
narrowing the question down to the semantics of LLMs at the word and sentence
level. By examining the inner workings of LLMs and their generated
representation of language and by drawing on classical semantic theories by
Frege and Russell, we get a more nuanced picture of the potential semantic
capabilities of LLMs.

Conclusion: 社区参与的标注和建模对实现包容性内容审核至关重要。

Abstract: Automatic toxic language detection is critical for creating safe, inclusive
online spaces. However, it is a highly subjective task, with perceptions of
toxic language shaped by community norms and lived experience. Existing
toxicity detection models are typically trained on annotations that collapse
diverse annotator perspectives into a single ground truth, erasing important
context-specific notions of toxicity such as reclaimed language. To address
this, we introduce MODELCITIZENS, a dataset of 6.8K social media posts and 40K
toxicity annotations across diverse identity groups. To capture the role of
conversational context on toxicity, typical of social media posts, we augment
MODELCITIZENS posts with LLM-generated conversational scenarios.
State-of-the-art toxicity detection tools (e.g. OpenAI Moderation API,
GPT-o4-mini) underperform on MODELCITIZENS, with further degradation on
context-augmented posts. Finally, we release LLAMACITIZEN-8B and
GEMMACITIZEN-12B, LLaMA- and Gemma-based models finetuned on MODELCITIZENS,
which outperform GPT-o4-mini by 5.5% on in-distribution evaluations. Our
findings highlight the importance of community-informed annotation and modeling

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and o1 have demonstrated strong
performance on clinical natural language processing (NLP) tasks across multiple
medical benchmarks. Nonetheless, two high-impact NLP tasks - structured tabular
reporting from nurse dictations and medical order extraction from
doctor-patient consultations - remain underexplored due to data scarcity and
sensitivity, despite active industry efforts. Practical solutions to these
real-world clinical tasks can significantly reduce the documentation burden on
healthcare providers, allowing greater focus on patient care. In this paper, we
investigate these two challenging tasks using private and open-source clinical
datasets, evaluating the performance of both open- and closed-weight LLMs, and
analyzing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we propose
an agentic pipeline for generating realistic, non-sensitive nurse dictations,
enabling structured extraction of clinical observations. To support further
research in both areas, we release SYNUR and SIMORD, the first open-source
datasets for nurse observation extraction and medical order extraction.

Result: 在MATH500、GSM8K和OlympiadBench-TO数据集上，LLaMA-3.1-8B模型性能提升高达16%。

Conclusion: R2-LLMs是一种高效的推理增强方法，显著提升复杂推理任务的准确性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling,
leveraging additional computational resources at inference time to enhance
model performance. In this work, we introduce R2-LLMs, a novel and versatile
hierarchical retrieval-augmented reasoning framework designed to improve
test-time scaling in large language models (LLMs) without requiring
distillation from more advanced models to obtain chain-of-thought (CoT)
training data. R2-LLMs enhances inference-time generalization by integrating
dual-level retrieval-based in-context learning: (1) At the coarse level, our
approach extracts abstract templates from complex reasoning problems and
retrieves similar problem-answer pairs to facilitate high-level in-context
learning; (2) At the fine level, during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), R2-LLMs
efficiently retrieves analogous intermediate solution steps from reference
mathematical problem datasets, refining step-wise reasoning with the aid of a
process reward model (PRM) for scoring. R2-LLMs is a robust hierarchical
reasoning-augmentation method that enhances in-context-level reasoning while
seamlessly integrating with step-level tree search methods. Utilizing PRM, it
refines both candidate generation and decision-making for improved reasoning
accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the MATH500, GSM8K, and OlympiadBench-TO
datasets achieve substantial relative improvement with an increase of up to 16%
using LLaMA-3.1-8B compared to the baselines, showcasing the effectiveness of
our approach in complex reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法在复杂指令遵循和数据修订成本方面存在不足，Re5旨在以资源高效的方式解决这些问题。

Result: 实验表明，Re5在少量数据下达到与GPT-4o-mini相当的性能，且修订后响应质量提升（64.24%胜率）。

Conclusion: Re5是一种高效且有效的方法，能以最小外部监督提升指令遵循能力。

Abstract: Various techniques have been proposed to improve large language models (LLMs)
adherence to formatting and instruction constraints. One of the most effective
approaches involves utilizing high-quality data generated by powerful models.
However, such models often fail to fully comply with complex instructions in a
single generation. To address this limitation, iterative revision methods have
been introduced. Nevertheless, as the number of data points and revision
iterations increases, the associated monetary costs grow significantly. As a
resource-efficient alternative, methods have been proposed that leverage
high-performance evaluation tools to compensate for the limited self-evaluation
capabilities of open-source LLMs. However, these approaches often lead to a
degradation in output quality due to excessive revision. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Re5, a self-evaluation and revision framework designed
to enhance instruction-following performance while preserving the quality of
the generated content. Re5 extracts task and constraint components from user
instructions, performs structural evaluations to prevent error accumulation,
and applies fine-grained constraint-specific content evaluations followed by
selective revisions. This process ensures precise and quality-preserving
improvements. The final high-quality outputs are used for alignment tuning,
enabling long-term alignment improvements through a data-centric iterative
refinement loop. Experimental results demonstrate that Re5 achieves
instruction-following performance comparable to models trained on data
generated by GPT-4o-mini, a high-performance model, even with a small amount of
data while maintaining response quality with a 64.24%-win rate over the
non-revised initial responses. These results validate Re5 as an efficient and
effective solution for enhancing instruction adherence with minimal external
supervision.

Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏通常是从LLM到SLM，但在文本匹配任务中，微调的小模型可能更有效。因此，作者希望结合小模型的领域专长和LLM的语义理解能力。

Method: 通过LoRA将LLM重新解释为编码器-解码器结构，编码器生成压缩表示，解码器映射到输出空间。使用提出的Margin-aware Contrastive Learning（MCL）对齐SLM和LLM的相似性分数。

Result: 在金融和医疗领域的基准测试及实际应用中验证了方法的有效性，模型已在线部署。

Conclusion: 翻转知识蒸馏方法成功结合了SLM和LLM的优势，提升了性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation typically involves transferring knowledge from a Large
Language Model (LLM) to a Smaller Language Model (SLM). However, in tasks such
as text matching, fine-tuned smaller models often yield more effective
domain-specific representations, as they focus on optimizing the similarity of
input pairs. To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the
rich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge
distillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM. Specifically, we address the
architectural gap between decoder-only LLMs and smaller encoder-based models by
reinterpreting LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder
generates compressed representations, while the decoder maps them to the output
space. During training, the encoder produces representations and their
similarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the
teacher, using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach.
The MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, and
adaptively handles the internal differences within positive and negative
samples. Our paradigm requires only a reasonably good-performing SLM, allowing
the LLM to achieve improved performance. Experiments on financial and
healthcare benchmarks, as well as real-world applications, confirm its
effectiveness, and the model has been fully deployed in an online environment.

Motivation: 解决RAG中有效上下文长度受限和检索文档冗余的问题，同时避免压缩方法丢失细粒度细节。

Method: SARA采用两层次上下文表示：细粒度自然语言片段和紧凑的语义压缩向量，结合动态重排模块优化上下文选择。

Result: 在9个数据集和5个开源LLM上，SARA显著提升了答案相关性（+17.71）、正确性（+13.72）和语义相似性（+15.53）。

Conclusion: SARA证明了结合文本和压缩表示对高效、稳健的RAG的重要性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but faces key challenges: restricted effective context
length and redundancy in retrieved documents. Pure compression-based approaches
reduce input size but often discard fine-grained details essential for factual
accuracy. We propose SARA, a unified RAG framework that balances local
precision and global knowledge coverage under tight context budgets. SARA
combines natural-language text snippets with semantic compression vectors to
jointly enhance context efficiency and answer correctness. It represents
contexts at two complementary levels: 1) fine-grained natural-language spans
that preserve critical entities and numerical values, and 2) compact,
interpretable vectors that summarize high-level semantics. An iterative
evidence-selection module employs the compression vectors for dynamic reranking
of contexts. Across 9 datasets and 5 open-source LLMs spanning 3 model families
(Mistral, Llama, and Gemma), SARA consistently improves answer relevance
(+17.71), answer correctness (+13.72), and semantic similarity (+15.53),
demonstrating the importance of integrating textual and compressed
representations for robust, context-efficient RAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言大模型在生成响应时倾向于使用主导语言的问题。

Method: 通过选择性调整标记级输出概率来抑制不需要的语言生成。

Result: 在Qwen模型上，该方法将非预期的中文输出减少了95%以上，同时保持多语言基准的任务准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升大模型的语言可控性提供了实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often exhibit language confusion, a
tendency to generate responses in a dominant language irrespective of the
prompt's language. To address this, we propose Smoothie-Qwen, a lightweight,
post-hoc method that mitigates language bias without retraining. This technique
selectively adjusts token-level output probabilities to effectively suppress
undesired language generation. Applied to the Qwen model, our method reduces
unintended Chinese output by over 95% while preserving task accuracy on
multilingual benchmarks. This work provides a practical and efficient solution
for enhancing the language controllability of LLMs, making them more reliable
for global applications.

Tool-augmented agents address arithmetic via code execution, but often falter
on complex logical tasks. We introduce a fine-tuning framework, DualDistill,

Motivation: 现有RAG基准多为静态且集中于英语，缺乏对俄语等语言动态性的支持。

Method: 构建动态更新的俄语新闻语料库，利用知识图谱自动生成问题，支持四种核心问题类型。

Result: 发布了完整的评估框架，包括问题生成管道、评估脚本和基准数据，并设立公共排行榜。

Conclusion: DRAGON填补了俄语RAG评估的空白，支持动态和多语言扩展。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely adopted approach for
improving the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge at inference time. Although there exist multiple RAG
benchmarks for English, evaluation resources for other languages, including
Russian, remain scarce and static, failing to capture the dynamic nature of
real-world deployments.
  In this work, we present DRAGON (Dynamic RAG Benchmark On News), the first
dynamic benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in Russian on a changing news
corpora. DRAGON is built upon a regularly updated corpus of Russian news and
public documents and supports comprehensive evaluation of both the retriever
and generator components. Question generation is performed automatically with
the use of Knowledge Graph constructed from the corpus and enables the
extraction of four core question types aligned with distinct subgraph patterns.
We release a complete evaluation framework comprising the pipeline for
automatic question generation, evaluation scripts, which are potentially
reusable for other languages and multilingual settings, and benchmark data. We
also launch a public leaderboard to encourage community participation and
comparison.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的RAG指令微调方法HIRAG，通过分层思维链增强模型的开放书考试能力，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统依赖大语言模型的上下文学习能力，但缺乏对RAG生成模型所需具体能力的深入研究，导致文档质量不一致和检索系统不完善的问题。

Method: 提出HIRAG方法，包含三个层次能力：过滤、组合和RAG特定推理，采用“先思考后回答”策略，利用多级渐进思维链。

Result: 实验表明，HIRAG在RGB、PopQA、MuSiQue、HotpotQA和PubmedQA等数据集上显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: HIRAG方法通过分层思维链和指令微调，有效解决了传统RAG系统的局限性，提升了模型的开放书考试能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a fundamental paradigm for
addressing the challenges faced by large language models in handling real-time
information and domain-specific problems. Traditional RAG systems primarily
rely on the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of the large language model
itself. Still, in-depth research on the specific capabilities needed by the RAG
generation model is lacking, leading to challenges with inconsistent document
quality and retrieval system imperfections. Even the limited studies that
fine-tune RAG generative models often \textit{lack a granular focus on RAG
task} or \textit{a deeper utilization of chain-of-thought processes}. To
address this, we propose that RAG models should possess three progressively
hierarchical abilities (1) Filtering: the ability to select relevant
information; (2) Combination: the ability to combine semantic information
across paragraphs; and (3) RAG-specific reasoning: the ability to further
process external knowledge using internal knowledge. Thus, we introduce our new
RAG instruction fine-tuning method, Hierarchical-Thought Instruction-Tuning
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HIRAG) incorporates a "think before answering"
strategy. This method enhances the model's open-book examination capability by
utilizing multi-level progressive chain-of-thought. Experiments show that the
HIRAG training strategy significantly improves the model's performance on
datasets such as RGB, PopQA, MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and PubmedQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE方法中各层路由器独立工作，专家选择缺乏相关性，限制了专家协作与专业化。

Method: 提出共享路由器的Omni-router Transformer，增强不同MoE层间专家的协作与专业化。

Result: 在大规模伪标签数据集和10个多样化ASR基准测试中，Omni-router Transformer训练损失更低，词错误率比密集模型和Switch Transformer分别降低11.2%和8.2%。

Conclusion: 共享路由器策略有效提升MoE模型的性能与鲁棒性，适用于多样化ASR任务。

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have expanded from language modeling
to automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional MoE methods, such as the
Switch Transformer, route experts independently within each layer. Our analysis
reveals that routers in most layers make expert choices that are not strongly
correlated with the choices of the routers in other layers. To increase the
cooperation between experts in different layers and encourage greater
specialization, we use a shared router across different MoE layers. We call
this model \emph{Omni-router Transformer}. Extensive experiments on a
large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset and evaluations across 10 diverse,
out-of-domain ASR benchmarks demonstrate that the Omni-router Transformer is
able to achieve lower training loss and consistently outperform dense and
Switch Transformer models, reducing average word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2%,
respectively, while providing structured expert usage and improved robustness
to diverse data.

Method: 通过将相关文档集群转化为多轮、多主题的信息寻求对话，构建了DocTalk数据集。

Result: 实验表明，使用DocTalk预训练的模型在多轮对话任务中的上下文记忆和理解能力提升了40%。

Conclusion: DocTalk是一种有效的预训练数据增强方法，能显著提升LLMs在多轮对话中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in multi-turn
conversational tasks, yet their pre-training data predominantly consists of
continuous prose, creating a potential mismatch between required capabilities
and training paradigms. We introduce a novel approach to address this
discrepancy by synthesizing conversational data from existing text corpora. We
present a pipeline that transforms a cluster of multiple related documents into
an extended multi-turn, multi-topic information-seeking dialogue. Applying our
pipeline to Wikipedia articles, we curate DocTalk, a multi-turn pre-training
dialogue corpus consisting of over 730k long conversations. We hypothesize that
exposure to such synthesized conversational structures during pre-training can
enhance the fundamental multi-turn capabilities of LLMs, such as context memory
and understanding. Empirically, we show that incorporating DocTalk during
pre-training results in up to 40% gain in context memory and understanding,
without compromising base performance. DocTalk is available at

Method: 基于基础形式本体论构建基准，系统分类模态补全任务，评估多种LVLMs的表现。

Result: 部分LVLMs在特定对象类别和日语提示下表现较差，甚至不如空白刺激。

Conclusion: LVLMs在模态补全任务中整体表现接近人类，但在特定条件下存在语言能力不足的问题。

Abstract: One of the main objectives in developing large vision-language models (LVLMs)
is to engineer systems that can assist humans with multimodal tasks, including
interpreting descriptions of perceptual experiences. A central phenomenon in
this context is amodal completion, in which people perceive objects even when
parts of those objects are hidden. Although numerous studies have assessed
whether computer-vision algorithms can detect or reconstruct occluded regions,
the inferential abilities of LVLMs on texts related to amodal completion remain
unexplored. To address this gap, we constructed a benchmark grounded in Basic
Formal Ontology to achieve a systematic classification of amodal completion.
Our results indicate that while many LVLMs achieve human-comparable performance
overall, their accuracy diverges for certain types of objects being completed.
Notably, in certain categories, some LLaVA-NeXT variants and Claude 3.5 Sonnet
exhibit lower accuracy on original images compared to blank stimuli lacking
visual content. Intriguingly, this disparity emerges only under Japanese
prompting, suggesting a deficiency in Japanese-specific linguistic competence
among these models.

Method: 比较文献中和提出的不同性能与偏见度量方法，评估荷兰语端到端ASR系统，并应用多种偏见缓解策略。

Result: 平均错误率不足以全面评估系统性能，需补充其他度量方法。

Conclusion: 建议在报告ASR性能和偏见时采用更全面的度量方法，以更好地反映系统对不同说话者群体的表现和整体偏见。

Abstract: There is increasingly more evidence that automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems are biased against different speakers and speaker groups, e.g., due to
gender, age, or accent. Research on bias in ASR has so far primarily focused on
detecting and quantifying bias, and developing mitigation approaches. Despite
this progress, the open question is how to measure the performance and bias of
a system. In this study, we compare different performance and bias measures,
from literature and proposed, to evaluate state-of-the-art end-to-end ASR
systems for Dutch. Our experiments use several bias mitigation strategies to
address bias against different speaker groups. The findings reveal that
averaged error rates, a standard in ASR research, alone is not sufficient and
should be supplemented by other measures. The paper ends with recommendations
for reporting ASR performance and bias to better represent a system's
performance for diverse speaker groups, and overall system bias.

Conclusion: 该框架为低成本调查开发开辟了新方向，并深化了对LLMs模拟人类行为的理解。数据集和代码将公开以支持未来研究。

Abstract: As psychometric surveys are increasingly used to assess the traits of large
language models (LLMs), the need for scalable survey item generation suited for
LLMs has also grown. A critical challenge here is ensuring the construct
validity of generated items, i.e., whether they truly measure the intended
trait. Traditionally, this requires costly, large-scale human data collection.
To make it efficient, we present a framework for virtual respondent simulation
using LLMs. Our central idea is to account for mediators: factors through which
the same trait can give rise to varying responses to a survey item. By
simulating respondents with diverse mediators, we identify survey items that
robustly measure intended traits. Experiments on three psychological trait
theories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA) show that our mediator generation methods and
simulation framework effectively identify high-validity items. LLMs demonstrate
the ability to generate plausible mediators from trait definitions and to
simulate respondent behavior for item validation. Our problem formulation,
metrics, methodology, and dataset open a new direction for cost-effective
survey development and a deeper understanding of how LLMs replicate human-like
behavior. We will publicly release our dataset and code to support future work.

Result: 发现评估方法和批量大小会影响编辑器排名，字符串匹配方法易产生假阳性匹配。

Conclusion: 现有评估方法存在局限性，需更全面的评估框架以确保知识编辑的公平性和模型能力的稳定性。

Abstract: Model editing has been gaining increasing attention over the past few years.
For Knowledge Editing in particular, more challenging evaluation datasets have
recently been released. These datasets use different methodologies to score the
success of editors. Yet, it remains under-explored how robust these
methodologies are and whether they unfairly favor some editors. Moreover, the
disruptive impact of these editors on overall model capabilities remains a
constant blind spot.
  We address both of these problems and show that choosing different metrics
and evaluation methodologies as well as different edit batch sizes can lead to
a different ranking of knowledge editors. Crucially we demonstrate this effect
also on general language understanding tasks evaluated alongside the knowledge
editing tasks. Further we include a manual assessment of the string matching
based evaluation method for knowledge editing that is favored by recently
released datasets, revealing a tendency to produce false positive matches.

Method: 提出DAEDCMD方法，利用基于Dirichlet过程的混合专家结构隔离事件特定参数以减少过去知识遗忘，并通过学习连续时间动态模型预测未来环境分布。

Result: 实验表明，DAEDCMD在六种MMD基线和三种持续学习方法中表现显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: DAEDCMD有效解决了持续MMD中的两大挑战，为多模态虚假信息检测提供了更适应动态环境的解决方案。

Abstract: Nowadays, misinformation articles, especially multimodal ones, are widely
spread on social media platforms and cause serious negative effects. To control
their propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active
topic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD
methods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in
real-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models
trained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this
issue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative,
inducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by
two major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the
detection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting. Second,
the social environment constantly evolves over time, affecting the
generalization on future data. To alleviate these challenges, we propose to
remember past knowledge by isolating interference between event-specific
parameters with a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure, and
anticipate future environmental distributions by learning a continuous-time
dynamics model. Accordingly, we induce a new continual MMD method DAEDCMD.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAEDCMD can consistently and
significantly outperform the compared methods, including six MMD baselines and
three continual learning methods.

Result: 统计n-gram和trie在已知前缀上表现更好，神经模型如T5和Phi-2在未知查询上更优，对话上下文显著提升效果。

Conclusion: 研究为Ghosting问题提供了全面分析，公开了代码和数据，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ghosting, the ability to predict a user's intended text input for inline
query auto-completion, is an invaluable feature for modern search engines and
chat interfaces, greatly enhancing user experience. By suggesting completions
to incomplete queries (or prefixes), ghosting aids users with slow typing
speeds, disabilities, or limited language proficiency. Ghosting is a
challenging problem and has become more important with the ubiquitousness of
chat-based systems like ChatGPT, Copilot, etc. Despite the increasing
prominence of chat-based systems utilizing ghosting, this challenging problem
of Chat-Ghosting has received little attention from the NLP/ML research
community. There is a lack of standardized benchmarks and relative performance
analysis of deep learning and non-deep learning methods. We address this
through an open and thorough study of this problem using four publicly
available dialog datasets: two human-human (DailyDialog and DSTC7-Ubuntu) and
two human-bot (Open Assistant and ShareGPT). We experiment with various
existing query auto-completion methods (using tries), n-gram methods and deep
learning methods, with and without dialog context. We also propose a novel
entropy-based dynamic early stopping strategy. Our analysis finds that
statistical n-gram models and tries outperform deep learning based models in
terms of both model performance and inference efficiency for seen prefixes. For
unseen queries, neural models like T5 and Phi-2 lead to better results. Adding
conversational context leads to significant improvements in ghosting quality,
especially for Open-Assistant and ShareGPT. We make code and data publicly
available

*Lucas Fonseca Lage,Simon Ostermann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OpenFActScore是一个开源实现，用于评估大型语言模型生成文本的事实性，支持使用Hugging Face兼容模型进行事实提取和验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决原FActScore依赖闭源商业模型的问题，提供透明、可复现且成本更低的评估工具。

Method: 通过Atomic Fact Generation（AFG）提取事实声明，Atomic Fact Validation（AFV）验证事实，支持开源模型。

Result: 开源模型（如Gemma）性能接近闭源系统，最终设置与原FActScore实验的Pearson相关性达0.99。

Conclusion: OpenFActScore提升了评估的透明度和可复现性，支持更广泛的研究和应用。

Abstract: We introduce OpenFActScore, an open-source implementation of the FActScore
framework for evaluating the factuality of text generated by large language
models (LLMs). FActScore evaluates the factual accuracy of long-form text by
using Atomic Fact Generation (AFG) to extract individual factual claims and
Atomic Fact Validation (AFV) to verify each claim against a trusted knowledge
source. While the original FActScore relies on closed-source and commercial
models such as InstructGPT and ChatGPT, OpenFActScore enables the use of any
Hugging Face-compatible model for both AFG and AFV. We provide a detailed
technical overview of our implementation, highlighting design choices and
modifications made to support open models. We evaluate multiple open-source
LLMs on both AFG and AFV using the original FActScore benchmark, reporting
BERTScore-F1 for AFG and Error Rate relative to human annotations for AFV. Our
results show that open models can approximate the performance of closed-source
systems, with Gemma achieving the best overall performance, and our final setup
obtains a 0.99 Pearson correlation with the original FActScore experiments.
OpenFActScore promotes transparency, reproducibility, and cost-effective
evaluation, and is available at: https://github.com/lflage/OpenFActScore.

Abstract: The ACL community has very little interest in evaluating the real-world
impact of NLP systems. A structured survey of the ACL Anthology shows that
perhaps 0.1% of its papers contain such evaluations; furthermore most papers
which include impact evaluations present them very sketchily and instead focus
on metric evaluations. NLP technology would be more useful and more quickly
adopted if we seriously tried to understand and evaluate its real-world impact.

TL;DR: RabakBench是一个针对新加坡多语言环境的安全基准测试，覆盖Singlish、中文、马来语和泰米尔语，用于评估LLMs在低资源语言中的安全性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于低资源语言缺乏训练数据和评估基准，LLMs及其安全分类器在这些语言中表现不佳。

Method: 通过三阶段流程构建RabakBench：(i)生成对抗性示例，(ii)半自动化多标签安全标注，(iii)高保真翻译。

Result: 评估显示11种流行安全分类器性能显著下降。

Conclusion: RabakBench为东南亚多语言环境提供了稳健的安全评估框架，并公开了数据集和代码。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their safety classifiers often perform
poorly on low-resource languages due to limited training data and evaluation
benchmarks. This paper introduces RabakBench, a new multilingual safety
benchmark localized to Singapore's unique linguistic context, covering
Singlish, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. RabakBench is constructed through a
scalable three-stage pipeline: (i) Generate - adversarial example generation by
augmenting real Singlish web content with LLM-driven red teaming; (ii) Label -
semi-automated multi-label safety annotation using majority-voted LLM labelers
aligned with human judgments; and (iii) Translate - high-fidelity translation
preserving linguistic nuance and toxicity across languages. The final dataset
comprises over 5,000 safety-labeled examples across four languages and six
fine-grained safety categories with severity levels. Evaluations of 11 popular
open-source and closed-source guardrail classifiers reveal significant
performance degradation. RabakBench not only enables robust safety evaluation
in Southeast Asian multilingual settings but also offers a reproducible
framework for building localized safety datasets in low-resource environments.
The benchmark dataset, including the human-verified translations, and
evaluation code are publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种语言模型自进化方法，通过多级原则生成和基于原则的实例生成，减少碳排放和数据泄漏风险，同时提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统语言模型训练中高碳排放和数据泄漏的问题。

Method: 1. 多级原则生成：大模型从小量任务数据中总结任务完成原则。2. 基于原则的实例生成：小模型利用原则生成大量数据用于训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升模型性能，并大幅减少碳排放。

Conclusion: 提出的自进化方法在性能和环保方面均优于传统方法。

Abstract: A common training approach for language models involves using a large-scale
language model to expand a human-provided dataset, which is subsequently used
for model training.This method significantly reduces training costs by
eliminating the need for extensive human data annotation. However, it still
faces challenges such as high carbon emissions during data augmentation and the
risk of data leakage when we use closed-source LLMs. To address these issues,
we propose a self-evolution method for language models. First, we introduce the
Multi-level Principle Generation, which enables a large-scale model to
summarize task-completion principles based on a small amount of task data.
Then, we propose the Principle-based Instance Generation, in which a
smaller-scale language model uses these task principles to generate a large
amount of data. This data is then used for model training. Experimental results
show that our proposed method significantly improves model performance compared
to directly using a smaller-scale language model to generate data.
Additionally, since we only use the large-scale language model to generate the
task-completion principles, the carbon emissions associated with training the
model are greatly reduced.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的自动合成数据生成和上下文学习方法，用于文档级实体和关系抽取，无需人工标注，并在零样本设置下进行了评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文档级实体和关系抽取中高质量标注数据稀缺的问题，特别是在零样本或少样本场景下。

Method: 结合合成数据生成与基于检索的上下文学习，使用推理优化的语言模型动态检索相关示例。

Result: 生成了包含5k+维基百科摘要、59k实体和30k关系三元组的合成数据集，并在DocIE共享任务中评估了零样本性能。

Conclusion: 文档级实体和关系的上下文联合抽取仍具挑战性，即使对最先进的大语言模型也是如此。

Abstract: Large, high-quality annotated corpora remain scarce in document-level entity
and relation extraction in zero-shot or few-shot settings. In this paper, we
present a fully automatic, LLM-based pipeline for synthetic data generation and
in-context learning for document-level entity and relation extraction. In
contrast to existing approaches that rely on manually annotated demonstrations
or direct zero-shot inference, our method combines synthetic data generation
with retrieval-based in-context learning, using a reasoning-optimized language
model. This allows us to build a high-quality demonstration database without
manual annotation and to dynamically retrieve relevant examples at inference
time. Based on our approach we produce a synthetic dataset of over $5k$
Wikipedia abstracts with approximately $59k$ entities and $30k$ relation
triples. Finally, we evaluate in-context learning performance on the DocIE
shared task, extracting entities and relations from long documents in a
zero-shot setting. We find that in-context joint entity and relation extraction
at document-level remains a challenging task, even for state-of-the-art large
language models.

Abstract: Embodied agents performing complex tasks are susceptible to execution
failures, motivating the need for effective failure recovery mechanisms. In
this work, we introduce a conditional multistage failure recovery framework
that employs zero-shot chain prompting. The framework is structured into four
error-handling stages, with three operating during task execution and one
functioning as a post-execution reflection phase. Our approach utilises the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs to analyse execution challenges within their
environmental context and devise strategic solutions. We evaluate our method on
the TfD benchmark of the TEACH dataset and achieve state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming a baseline without error recovery by 11.5% and
surpassing the strongest existing model by 19%.

Result: 数据熵与记忆分数呈线性相关，随机字符串的熵低于训练语料库。

Conclusion: 熵-记忆定律为理解LLMs的记忆机制提供了新视角，并可用于区分训练和测试数据。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to memorize portions of their training
data, sometimes reproducing content verbatim when prompted appropriately. In
this work, we investigate a fundamental yet under-explored question in the
domain of memorization: How to characterize memorization difficulty of training
data in LLMs? Through empirical experiments on OLMo, a family of open models,
we present the Entropy-Memorization Law. It suggests that data entropy is
linearly correlated with memorization score. Moreover, in a case study of
memorizing highly randomized strings, or "gibberish", we observe that such
sequences, despite their apparent randomness, exhibit unexpectedly low
empirical entropy compared to the broader training corpus. Adopting the same
strategy to discover Entropy-Memorization Law, we derive a simple yet effective
approach to distinguish training and testing data, enabling Dataset Inference
(DI).

visualizations comparing different frameworks. We identify challenges in
computational efficiency and training stability, and discuss future directions
in improving training robustness and broadening application scope.

TL;DR: NeoBabel是一个多语言文本到图像生成框架，支持六种语言，通过多语言预训练和高分辨率指令调优实现高效、包容的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到图像生成系统以英语为中心的问题，减少翻译管道带来的语义漂移、计算开销和文化偏差。

Method: 结合大规模多语言预训练和高分辨率指令调优，训练NeoBabel模型，并扩展两个多语言基准测试（m-GenEval和m-DPG）。

Result: NeoBabel在多语言任务中表现优异（m-GenEval得分0.75，m-DPG得分0.68），同时保持英语任务的高性能，且模型体积更小。

Conclusion: 多语言能力不是性能的折衷，而是提升生成AI鲁棒性、效率和文化保真度的催化剂。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation advancements have been predominantly
English-centric, creating barriers for non-English speakers and perpetuating
digital inequities. While existing systems rely on translation pipelines, these
introduce semantic drift, computational overhead, and cultural misalignment. We
introduce NeoBabel, a novel multilingual image generation framework that sets a
new Pareto frontier in performance, efficiency and inclusivity, supporting six
languages: English, Chinese, Dutch, French, Hindi, and Persian. The model is
trained using a combination of large-scale multilingual pretraining and
high-resolution instruction tuning. To evaluate its capabilities, we expand two
English-only benchmarks to multilingual equivalents: m-GenEval and m-DPG.
NeoBabel achieves state-of-the-art multilingual performance while retaining
strong English capability, scoring 0.75 on m-GenEval and 0.68 on m-DPG.
Notably, it performs on par with leading models on English tasks while
outperforming them by +0.11 and +0.09 on multilingual benchmarks, even though
these models are built on multilingual base LLMs. This demonstrates the
effectiveness of our targeted alignment training for preserving and extending
crosslingual generalization. We further introduce two new metrics to rigorously
assess multilingual alignment and robustness to code-mixed prompts. Notably,
NeoBabel matches or exceeds English-only models while being 2-4x smaller. We
release an open toolkit, including all code, model checkpoints, a curated
dataset of 124M multilingual text-image pairs, and standardized multilingual
evaluation protocols, to advance inclusive AI research. Our work demonstrates
that multilingual capability is not a trade-off but a catalyst for improved
robustness, efficiency, and cultural fidelity in generative AI.

Result: LLMs能形成自洽系统，但解决方案缺乏多样性和鲁棒性；结合人类生成内容和模型混合可显著提升性能。

Conclusion: LLMs在代码生成中表现出一定一致性，但也存在认知偏差，未来可通过自我反思和改进提升模型能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code
generation, yet their true programming competence remains underexplored. We
introduce the Code Triangle framework, which systematically evaluates LLMs
across three fundamental dimensions: editorial analysis, code implementation,
and test case generation. Through extensive experiments on competitive
programming benchmarks, we reveal that while LLMs can form a self-consistent
system across these dimensions, their solutions often lack the diversity and
robustness of human programmers. We identify a significant distribution shift
between model cognition and human expertise, with model errors tending to
cluster due to training data biases and limited reasoning transfer. Our study
demonstrates that incorporating human-generated editorials, solutions, and
diverse test cases, as well as leveraging model mixtures, can substantially
enhance both the performance and robustness of LLMs. Furthermore, we reveal
both the consistency and inconsistency in the cognition of LLMs that may
facilitate self-reflection and self-improvement, providing a potential
direction for developing more powerful coding models.

Abstract: We introduce Skywork-R1V3, an advanced, open-source vision-language model
(VLM) that pioneers a new approach to visual reasoning. Its key innovation lies
in effectively transferring reasoning skills from text-only Large Language
Models (LLMs) to visual tasks. The strong performance of Skywork-R1V3 primarily
stems from our elaborate post-training RL framework, which effectively
activates and enhances the model's reasoning ability, without the need for
additional continue pre-training. Through this framework, we further uncover
the fundamental role of the connector module in achieving robust cross-modal
alignment for multimodal reasoning models. In addition, we introduce a unique
indicator of reasoning capability, the entropy of critical reasoning tokens,
which has proven highly effective for checkpoint selection during RL training.
Skywork-R1V3 achieves state-of-the-art results on MMMU, significantly improving
from 64.3% to 76.0%. This performance matches entry-level human capabilities.
Remarkably, our RL-powered post-training approach enables even the 38B
parameter model to rival top closed-source VLMs. The implementation
successfully transfers mathematical reasoning to other subject-related
reasoning tasks. We also include an analysis of curriculum learning and
reinforcement finetuning strategies, along with a broader discussion on
multimodal reasoning. Skywork-R1V3 represents a significant leap in multimodal
reasoning, showcasing RL as a powerful engine for advancing open-source VLM
capabilities.

Motivation: 解决自然语言数学语句形式化验证中批评阶段的不足，确保生成的代码语义正确。

Method: 提出CriticLeanGPT模型和CriticLeanBench基准，结合监督微调和强化学习，评估Lean 4形式化的语义保真度。

Result: CriticLeanGPT显著优于基线模型，并构建了包含285K问题的FineLeanCorpus数据集。

Conclusion: 优化批评阶段对生成可靠形式化至关重要，CriticLean为形式数学推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Translating natural language mathematical statements into formal, executable
code is a fundamental challenge in automated theorem proving. While prior work
has focused on generation and compilation success, little attention has been
paid to the critic phase-the evaluation of whether generated formalizations
truly capture the semantic intent of the original problem. In this paper, we
introduce CriticLean, a novel critic-guided reinforcement learning framework
that elevates the role of the critic from a passive validator to an active
learning component. Specifically, first, we propose the CriticLeanGPT, trained
via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, to rigorously assess the
semantic fidelity of Lean 4 formalizations. Then, we introduce CriticLeanBench,
a benchmark designed to measure models' ability to distinguish semantically
correct from incorrect formalizations, and demonstrate that our trained
CriticLeanGPT models can significantly outperform strong open- and
closed-source baselines. Building on the CriticLean framework, we construct
FineLeanCorpus, a dataset comprising over 285K problems that exhibits rich
domain diversity, broad difficulty coverage, and high correctness based on
human evaluation. Overall, our findings highlight that optimizing the critic
phase is essential for producing reliable formalizations, and we hope our
CriticLean will provide valuable insights for future advances in formal
mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents our submission to Task 1, Subjectivity Detection, of the
CheckThat! Lab at CLEF 2025. We investigate the effectiveness of
transfer-learning and stylistic data augmentation to improve classification of
subjective and objective sentences in English news text. Our approach contrasts
fine-tuning of pre-trained encoders and transfer-learning of fine-tuned
transformer on related tasks. We also introduce a controlled augmentation
pipeline using GPT-4o to generate paraphrases in predefined subjectivity
styles. To ensure label and style consistency, we employ the same model to
correct and refine the generated samples. Results show that transfer-learning
of specified encoders outperforms fine-tuning general-purpose ones, and that
carefully curated augmentation significantly enhances model robustness,
especially in detecting subjective content. Our official submission placed us
$16^{th}$ of 24 participants. Overall, our findings underscore the value of
combining encoder specialization with label-consistent augmentation for
improved subjectivity detection. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 证据质量是数值声明事实核查的主要瓶颈，未来需优化证据检索。

Abstract: Numerical claims, statements involving quantities, comparisons, and temporal
references, pose unique challenges for automated fact-checking systems. In this
study, we evaluate modeling strategies for veracity prediction of such claims
using the QuanTemp dataset and building our own evidence retrieval pipeline. We
investigate three key factors: (1) the impact of more evidences with longer
input context windows using ModernBERT, (2) the effect of right-to-left (R2L)
tokenization, and (3) their combined influence on classification performance.
Contrary to prior findings in arithmetic reasoning tasks, R2L tokenization does
not boost natural language inference (NLI) of numerical tasks. A longer context
window does also not enhance veracity performance either, highlighting evidence
quality as the dominant bottleneck. Our best-performing system achieves
competitive macro-average F1 score of 0.57 and places us among the Top-4
submissions in Task 3 of CheckThat! 2025. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 潜在推理为LLM推理能力提供了新的研究方向，有望突破显式推理的局限性。相关GitHub仓库收集了最新论文和资源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, especially when guided by explicit chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning that verbalizes intermediate steps. While CoT improves both
interpretability and accuracy, its dependence on natural language reasoning
limits the model's expressive bandwidth. Latent reasoning tackles this
bottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's
continuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. To advance latent
reasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the
emerging field of latent reasoning. We begin by examining the foundational role
of neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning,
highlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations.
Next, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including
activation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning
strategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces. Finally, we
discuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked
diffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning
processes. By unifying these perspectives, we aim to clarify the conceptual
landscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the
frontier of LLM cognition. An associated GitHub repository collecting the

### [137] [Efficiency-Effectiveness Reranking FLOPs for LLM-based Rerankers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06223)
*Zhiyuan Peng,Ting-ruen Wei,Tingyu Song,Yilun Zhao,Yi Fang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的评估指标E²R-FLOPs，用于衡量基于大语言模型（LLM）的重新排序任务的效率与效果之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM重新排序效率的指标（如延迟、前向传递次数等）依赖硬件和运行时选择，难以准确反映模型效率与效果的权衡。

Method: 提出E²R-FLOPs指标（RPP和QPP）和一个可解释的FLOPs估计器，用于硬件无关的评估。

Result: 通过实验评估了多种LLM重新排序器的效率与效果，揭示了其权衡关系。

Conclusion: 新指标为研究社区提供了更清晰的效率与效果评估工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been applied to reranking tasks in
information retrieval, achieving strong performance. However, their high
computational demands often hinder practical deployment. Existing studies
evaluate the efficiency of LLM-based rerankers using proxy metrics such as
latency, the number of forward passes, input tokens, and output tokens.
However, these metrics depend on hardware and running-time choices (\eg
parallel or not, batch size, etc), and often fail to account for model size,
making it difficult to interpret and obscuring the evaluation of the
efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff. To address this issue, we propose
E\textsuperscript{2}R-FLOPs, for LLM-based rerankers: ranking metrics per
PetaFLOP (RPP) for relevance per compute and queries per PetaFLOP (QPP) for
hardware-agnostic throughput. Companied with the new metrics, an interpretable
FLOPs estimator is built to estimate the FLOPs of an LLM-based reranker even
without running any experiments. Based on the proposed metrics, we conduct
comprehensive experiments to evaluate a wide range of LLM-based rerankers with
different architecture, studying the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off and
bringing this issue to the attention of the research community.

TL;DR: Agent KB是一个分层经验框架，通过Reason-Retrieve-Refine流程解决语言代理在跨领域任务中的错误修正和经验复用问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言代理无法从彼此的经验中学习，限制了复杂任务的解决能力。

Method: 采用分层经验框架，结合高层策略和详细执行日志，构建共享知识库。

Result: 在GAIA基准测试中，成功率提升高达16.28%；Claude-3和GPT-4在挑战性任务中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: Agent KB为语言代理提供了模块化、框架无关的基础设施，支持经验学习和策略泛化。

Abstract: As language agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, they struggle with
effective error correction and experience reuse across domains. We introduce
Agent KB, a hierarchical experience framework that enables complex agentic
problem solving via a novel Reason-Retrieve-Refine pipeline. Agent KB addresses
a core limitation: agents traditionally cannot learn from each other's
experiences. By capturing both high-level strategies and detailed execution
logs, Agent KB creates a shared knowledge base that enables cross-agent
knowledge transfer. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Agent KB improves success
rates by up to 16.28 percentage points. On the most challenging tasks, Claude-3
improves from 38.46% to 57.69%, while GPT-4 improves from 53.49% to 73.26% on
intermediate tasks. On SWE-bench code repair, Agent KB enables Claude-3 to
improve from 41.33% to 53.33%. Our results suggest that Agent KB provides a
modular, framework-agnostic infrastructure for enabling agents to learn from
past experiences and generalize successful strategies to new tasks.

TL;DR: 论文评估了多任务机器人操作策略（LBMs），发现多任务预训练提高了策略的成功率和鲁棒性，并减少了新任务的学习数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型机器人基础模型（LBMs）在真实世界中的性能，以推动其发展并更全面地理解其能力。

Method: 扩展Diffusion Policy范式，提出并验证了一个评估流程，通过模拟和真实实验比较多任务与单任务基线。

Result: 多任务预训练使策略更成功、鲁棒，且能更快学习新任务，数据需求显著减少；性能随预训练规模和多样性提升。

Conclusion: 多任务预训练是提升机器人操作策略的有效方法，未来可进一步扩展其规模和多样性。

Abstract: Robot manipulation has seen tremendous progress in recent years, with
imitation learning policies enabling successful performance of dexterous and
hard-to-model tasks. Concurrently, scaling data and model size has led to the
development of capable language and vision foundation models, motivating
large-scale efforts to create general-purpose robot foundation models. While
these models have garnered significant enthusiasm and investment, meaningful
evaluation of real-world performance remains a challenge, limiting both the
pace of development and inhibiting a nuanced understanding of current
capabilities. In this paper, we rigorously evaluate multitask robot
manipulation policies, referred to as Large Behavior Models (LBMs), by
extending the Diffusion Policy paradigm across a corpus of simulated and
real-world robot data. We propose and validate an evaluation pipeline to
rigorously analyze the capabilities of these models with statistical
confidence. We compare against single-task baselines through blind, randomized
trials in a controlled setting, using both simulation and real-world
experiments. We find that multi-task pretraining makes the policies more
successful and robust, and enables teaching complex new tasks more quickly,
using a fraction of the data when compared to single-task baselines. Moreover,
performance predictably increases as pretraining scale and diversity grows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决海洋机器人中的立体声数据融合问题，提高特征对应和3D信息恢复的准确性。

Method: 利用声纳的相对位姿信息，将观测特征从一种声纳图像投影到另一种声纳图像，类似于立体相机的极线几何。

Result: 通过模拟结果确定了适用于野外机器人应用的理想立体配置。

Conclusion: 该方法在特征对应和3D信息恢复方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we address stereo acoustic data fusion for marine robotics and
propose a geometry-based method for projecting observed features from one sonar
to another for a cross-modal stereo sonar setup that consists of both a
forward-looking and a sidescan sonar. Our acoustic geometry for sidescan and
forward-looking sonar is inspired by the epipolar geometry for stereo cameras,
and we leverage relative pose information to project where an observed feature
in one sonar image will be found in the image of another sonar. Additionally,
we analyze how both the feature location relative to the sonar and the relative
pose between the two sonars impact the projection. From simulated results, we
identify desirable stereo configurations for applications in field robotics
like feature correspondence and recovery of the 3D information of the feature.

*Yi-Shiuan Tung,Bradley Hayes,Alessandro Roncone*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CRED是一种用于主动偏好学习（APL）的轨迹生成方法，通过联合优化环境设计和轨迹选择，提高奖励估计效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人需要适应人类偏好（如距离、时间和安全的平衡），但现有APL方法在长时任务中难以探索完整轨迹空间和生成信息性查询。

Method: CRED通过环境设计“想象”新场景，并利用反事实推理生成多样且信息丰富的轨迹用于排序。

Result: 在GridWorld和OpenStreetMap导航实验中，CRED提升了奖励学习效果并具有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: CRED通过创新的轨迹生成方法，显著提高了APL在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: For effective real-world deployment, robots should adapt to human
preferences, such as balancing distance, time, and safety in delivery routing.
Active preference learning (APL) learns human reward functions by presenting
trajectories for ranking. However, existing methods often struggle to explore
the full trajectory space and fail to identify informative queries,
particularly in long-horizon tasks. We propose CRED, a trajectory generation
method for APL that improves reward estimation by jointly optimizing
environment design and trajectory selection. CRED "imagines" new scenarios
through environment design and uses counterfactual reasoning -- by sampling
rewards from its current belief and asking "What if this reward were the true
preference?" -- to generate a diverse and informative set of trajectories for
ranking. Experiments in GridWorld and real-world navigation using OpenStreetMap
data show that CRED improves reward learning and generalizes effectively across
different environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合视觉和触觉观测的GPDF表示方法，用于主动感知物体属性，无需大量预训练数据，通过迭代优化几何形状和量化不确定性实现精确3D结构重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人因缺乏先验知识难以理解物体属性（如形状、材质），而人类通过多感官交互学习这些属性。本文旨在通过多模态融合提升机器人的感知能力。

Method: 提出GPDF表示，结合点云、梯度、Hessian和表面不确定性，通过视觉初始估计和触觉测量迭代优化几何形状，并规划探索性动作以最大化信息增益。

Result: 实验使用Franka Research 3机器人和定制传感器，成功实现了对静态物体形状和属性的主动探索与映射。

Conclusion: GPDF方法在多模态融合和主动探索中表现出潜力，可扩展至几何以外的属性建模。

Abstract: Robots struggle to understand object properties like shape, material, and
semantics due to limited prior knowledge, hindering manipulation in
unstructured environments. In contrast, humans learn these properties through
interactive multi-sensor exploration. This work proposes fusing visual and
tactile observations into a unified Gaussian Process Distance Field (GPDF)
representation for active perception of object properties. While primarily
focusing on geometry, this approach also demonstrates potential for modeling
surface properties beyond geometry. The GPDF encodes signed distance using
point cloud, analytic gradient and Hessian, and surface uncertainty estimates,
which are attributes that common neural network shape representation lack. By
utilizing a point cloud to construct a distance function, GPDF does not need
extensive pretraining on large datasets and can incorporate observations by
aggregation. Starting with an initial visual shape estimate, the framework
iteratively refines the geometry by integrating dense vision measurements using
differentiable rendering and tactile measurements at uncertain surface regions.
By quantifying multi-sensor uncertainties, it plans exploratory motions to
maximize information gain for recovering precise 3D structures. For the
real-world robot experiment, we utilize the Franka Research 3 robot
manipulator, which is fixed on a table and has a customized DIGIT tactile
sensor and an Intel Realsense D435 RGBD camera mounted on the end-effector. In
these experiments, the robot explores the shape and properties of objects
assumed to be static and placed on the table. To improve scalability, we
investigate approximation methods like inducing point method for Gaussian
Processes. This probabilistic multi-modal fusion enables active exploration and
mapping of complex object geometries, extending potentially beyond geometry.

Abstract: We introduce PAPRLE (Plug-And-Play Robotic Limb Environment), a modular
ecosystem that enables flexible placement and control of robotic limbs. With
PAPRLE, a user can change the arrangement of the robotic limbs, and control
them using a variety of input devices, including puppeteers, gaming
controllers, and VR-based interfaces. This versatility supports a wide range of
teleoperation scenarios and promotes adaptability to different task
requirements. To further enhance configurability, we introduce a pluggable
puppeteer device that can be easily mounted and adapted to match the target
robot configurations. PAPRLE supports bilateral teleoperation through these
puppeteer devices, agnostic to the type or configuration of the follower robot.
By supporting both joint-space and task-space control, the system provides
real-time force feedback, improving user fidelity and physical interaction
awareness. The modular design of PAPRLE facilitates novel spatial arrangements
of the limbs and enables scalable data collection, thereby advancing research
in embodied AI and learning-based control. We validate PAPRLE in various
real-world settings, demonstrating its versatility across diverse combinations
of leader devices and follower robots. The system will be released as open

Motivation: 传统机器人系统依赖预定义脚本或大规模演示数据，Auto-RubikAI旨在实现可解释的多步任务执行，减少数据依赖。

Method: 系统采用知识库模块解决符号推理问题，视觉语言模型解析RGB-D输入构建3D场景，大语言模型生成结构化控制代码。

Result: 实验显示79%的任务成功率，相比基线方法减少步骤并保持可解释性和安全性。

Conclusion: Auto-RubikAI为智能制造和机器人教育提供了高效、模块化的任务规划基础。

Abstract: This paper presents Auto-RubikAI, a modular autonomous planning framework
that integrates a symbolic Knowledge Base (KB), a vision-language model (VLM),
and a large language model (LLM) to solve structured manipulation tasks
exemplified by Rubik's Cube restoration. Unlike traditional robot systems based
on predefined scripts, or modern approaches relying on pretrained networks and
large-scale demonstration data, Auto-RubikAI enables interpretable, multi-step
task execution with minimal data requirements and no prior demonstrations. The
proposed system employs a KB module to solve group-theoretic restoration steps,
overcoming LLMs' limitations in symbolic reasoning. A VLM parses RGB-D input to
construct a semantic 3D scene representation, while the LLM generates
structured robotic control code via prompt chaining. This tri-module
architecture enables robust performance under spatial uncertainty. We deploy
Auto-RubikAI in both simulation and real-world settings using a 7-DOF robotic
arm, demonstrating effective Sim-to-Real adaptation without retraining.
Experiments show a 79% end-to-end task success rate across randomized
configurations. Compared to CFOP, DeepCubeA, and Two-Phase baselines, our
KB-enhanced method reduces average solution steps while maintaining
interpretability and safety. Auto-RubikAI provides a cost-efficient, modular
foundation for embodied task planning in smart manufacturing, robotics
education, and autonomous execution scenarios. Code, prompts, and hardware
modules will be released upon publication.

Result: 实验表明，DreamGrasp能准确恢复物体几何，并支持后续任务如顺序清理和目标检索，成功率较高。

Conclusion: DreamGrasp在复杂多物体环境中实现了鲁棒的3D重建，克服了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Partial-view 3D recognition -- reconstructing 3D geometry and identifying
object instances from a few sparse RGB images -- is an exceptionally
challenging yet practically essential task, particularly in cluttered, occluded
real-world settings where full-view or reliable depth data are often
unavailable. Existing methods, whether based on strong symmetry priors or
supervised learning on curated datasets, fail to generalize to such scenarios.
In this work, we introduce DreamGrasp, a framework that leverages the
imagination capability of large-scale pre-trained image generative models to
infer the unobserved parts of a scene. By combining coarse 3D reconstruction,
instance segmentation via contrastive learning, and text-guided instance-wise
refinement, DreamGrasp circumvents limitations of prior methods and enables
robust 3D reconstruction in complex, multi-object environments. Our experiments
show that DreamGrasp not only recovers accurate object geometry but also
supports downstream tasks like sequential decluttering and target retrieval
with high success rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超越半经验地形力学方法（如Bekker-Wong/Janosi-Hanamoto），提供基于物理的模型以处理复杂任务。

Method: 基于Chrono的SPH框架，支持地形与刚性和柔性工具的交互，并通过GPU加速实现高效计算。

Result: 验证了与实验数据和高保真DEM模拟的一致性，支持大规模地形模拟（10公里，1亿SPH粒子）。

Conclusion: Chrono::CRM是一种高效、开源的地形力学模拟工具，适用于大规模复杂任务。

Abstract: This paper discusses Chrono's Continuous Representation Model (called herein
Chrono::CRM), a general-purpose, scalable, and efficient simulation solution
for terramechanics problems. Built on Chrono's Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
(SPH) framework, Chrono::CRM moves beyond semi-empirical terramechanics
approaches, e.g., Bekker-Wong/Janosi-Hanamoto, to provide a physics-based model
able to address complex tasks such as digging, grading, as well as interaction
with deformable wheels and complex grouser/lug patterns. The terramechanics
model is versatile in that it allows the terrain to interact with both rigid
and flexible implements simulated via the Chrono dynamics engine. We validate
Chrono::CRM against experimental data from three physical tests, including one
involving NASA's MGRU3 rover. In addition, the simulator is benchmarked against
a high-fidelity Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation of a digging scenario
involving the Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operations Robot (RASSOR).
Being GPU-accelerated, Chrono::CRM achieves computational efficiency comparable
to that of semi-empirical simulation approaches for terramechanics problems.
Through an ``active domains'' implementation, Chrono::CRM can handle terrain
stretches up to 10 km long with 100 million SPH particles at near interactive
rates, making high-fidelity off-road simulations at large scales feasible. As a
component of the Chrono package, the CRM model is open source and released
under a BSD-3 license. All models and simulations used in this contribution are
available in a public GitHub repository for reproducibility studies and further
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂城市环境中GNSS定位不可靠及传统地图方法存储和计算效率低的问题。

Method: 结合多传感器数据构建高精度3DGS地图，利用SuperPoint和SuperGlue进行特征提取与匹配，并通过迭代优化策略逐步优化定位结果。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，3DGS-LSR在城镇道路、林荫道和交通密集高速路上的平均定位精度分别为0.026m、0.029m和0.081m，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 3DGS-LSR为自主机器人提供了在GNSS失效的复杂城市环境中可靠的定位能力。

Abstract: In autonomous robotic systems, precise localization is a prerequisite for
safe navigation. However, in complex urban environments, GNSS positioning often
suffers from signal occlusion and multipath effects, leading to unreliable
absolute positioning. Traditional mapping approaches are constrained by storage
requirements and computational inefficiency, limiting their applicability to
resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address these challenges, we propose
3DGS-LSR: a large-scale relocalization framework leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling centimeter-level positioning using only a single
monocular RGB image on the client side. We combine multi-sensor data to
construct high-accuracy 3DGS maps in large outdoor scenes, while the robot-side
localization requires just a standard camera input. Using SuperPoint and
SuperGlue for feature extraction and matching, our core innovation is an
iterative optimization strategy that refines localization results through
step-by-step rendering, making it suitable for real-time autonomous navigation.
Experimental validation on the KITTI dataset demonstrates our 3DGS-LSR achieves
average positioning accuracies of 0.026m, 0.029m, and 0.081m in town roads,
boulevard roads, and traffic-dense highways respectively, significantly
outperforming other representative methods while requiring only monocular RGB
input. This approach provides autonomous robots with reliable localization
capabilities even in challenging urban environments where GNSS fails.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了RCM机械臂控制稳定性的空白，为未来自主手术的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Remote Center of Motion (RCM) robotic manipulators have revolutionized
Minimally Invasive Surgery, enabling precise, dexterous surgical manipulation
within the patient's body cavity without disturbing the insertion point on the
patient. Accurate RCM tool control is vital for incorporating autonomous
subtasks like suturing, blood suction, and tumor resection into robotic
surgical procedures, reducing surgeon fatigue and improving patient outcomes.
However, these cable-driven systems are subject to significant joint reading
errors, corrupting the kinematics computation necessary to perform control.
Although visual tracking with endoscopic cameras can correct errors on in-view
joints, errors in the kinematic chain prior to the insertion point are
irreparable because they remain out of view. No prior work has characterized
the stability of control under these conditions. We fill this gap by designing
a provably stable tracking-in-the-loop controller for the out-of-view portion
of the RCM manipulator kinematic chain. We additionally incorporate this
controller into a bilevel control scheme for the full kinematic chain. We
rigorously benchmark our method in simulated and real world settings to verify
our theoretical findings. Our work provides key insights into the next steps
required for the transition from teleoperated to autonomous surgery.

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the powerful capabilities of imitation
learning in robotics. Leveraging generative models, particularly diffusion
models, these approaches offer notable advantages such as strong multi-task
generalization, effective language conditioning, and high sample efficiency.
While their application has been successful in manipulation tasks, their use in
legged locomotion remains relatively underexplored, mainly due to compounding
errors that affect stability and difficulties in task transition under limited
data. Online reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated promising results in
legged robot control in the past years, providing valuable insights to address
these challenges. In this work, we propose DMLoco, a diffusion-based framework
for quadruped robots that integrates multi-task pretraining with online PPO
finetuning to enable language-conditioned control and robust task transitions.
Our approach first pretrains the policy on a diverse multi-task dataset using
diffusion models, enabling language-guided execution of various skills. Then,
it finetunes the policy in simulation to ensure robustness and stable task
transition during real-world deployment. By utilizing Denoising Diffusion
Implicit Models (DDIM) for efficient sampling and TensorRT for optimized
deployment, our policy runs onboard at 50Hz, offering a scalable and efficient
solution for adaptive, language-guided locomotion on resource-constrained
robotic platforms.

Conclusion: hPGA-DP通过几何偏置和混合架构显著提升了扩散策略的效果和效率。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have become increasingly popular in robot learning due to
their reliable convergence in motion generation tasks. At a high level, these
policies learn to transform noisy action trajectories into effective ones,
conditioned on observations. However, each time such a model is trained in a
robotics context, the network must relearn fundamental spatial representations
and operations, such as translations and rotations, from scratch in order to
ground itself and operate effectively in a 3D environment. Incorporating
geometric inductive biases directly into the network can alleviate this
redundancy and substantially improve training efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce hPGA-DP, a diffusion policy approach that integrates a mathematical
framework called Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA) to embed strong geometric
inductive biases. PGA is particularly well-suited for this purpose as it
provides a unified algebraic framework that naturally encodes geometric
primitives, such as points, directions, and rotations, enabling neural networks
to reason about spatial structure through interpretable and composable
operations. Specifically, we propose a novel diffusion policy architecture that
incorporates the Projective Geometric Algebra Transformer (P-GATr), leveraging
its E(3)-equivariant properties established in prior work. Our approach adopts
a hybrid architecture strategy, using P-GATr as both a state encoder and action
decoder, while employing U-Net or Transformer-based modules for the denoising
process. Several experiments and ablation studies in both simulated and
real-world environments demonstrate that hPGA-DP not only improves task
performance and training efficiency through the geometric bias of P-GATr, but
also achieves substantially faster convergence through its hybrid model
compared to architectures that rely solely on P-GATr.

Abstract: Safety is a critical concern in motion planning for autonomous vehicles.
Modern autonomous vehicles rely on neural network-based perception, but making
control decisions based on these inference results poses significant safety
risks due to inherent uncertainties. To address this challenge, we present a
distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework that accounts for both
aleatoric and epistemic perception uncertainties using evidential deep learning
(EDL). Our approach introduces a novel ambiguity set formulation based on
evidential distributions that dynamically adjusts the conservativeness
according to perception confidence levels. We integrate this uncertainty-aware
constraint into model predictive control (MPC), proposing the DRO-EDL-MPC
algorithm with computational tractability for autonomous driving applications.
Validation in the CARLA simulator demonstrates that our approach maintains
efficiency under high perception confidence while enforcing conservative
constraints under low confidence.

Abstract: High fidelity estimation algorithms for robotics require accurate data.
However, timestamping of sensor data is a key issue that rarely receives the
attention it deserves. Inaccurate timestamping can be compensated for in
post-processing but is imperative for online estimation. Simultaneously, even
online mitigation of timing issues can be achieved through a relaxation of the
tuning parameters from their otherwise more performative optimal values, but at
a detriment to performance. To address the need for real-time, low-cost
timestamping, a versatile system which utilizes readily-available components
and established methods for synchronization is introduced. The synchronization
and triggering (of both high- and low-rate sensors) capabilities of the system
are demonstrated.

Abstract: Inertia drift is a transitional maneuver between two sustained drift stages
in opposite directions, which provides valuable insights for navigating
consecutive sharp corners for autonomous racing.However, this can be a
challenging scenario for the drift controller to handle rapid transitions
between opposing sideslip angles while maintaining accurate path tracking.
Moreover, accurate drift control depends on a high-fidelity vehicle model to
derive drift equilibrium points and predict vehicle states, but this is often
compromised by the strongly coupled longitudinal-lateral drift dynamics and
unpredictable environmental variations. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a learning-based planning and control framework utilizing Bayesian
optimization (BO), which develops a planning logic to ensure a smooth
transition and minimal velocity loss between inertia and sustained drift
phases. BO is further employed to learn a performance-driven control policy
that mitigates modeling errors for enhanced system performance. Simulation
results on an 8-shape reference path demonstrate that the proposed framework
can achieve smooth and stable inertia drift through sharp corners.

Abstract: A principal barrier to large-scale deployment of urban autonomous driving
systems lies in the prevalence of complex scenarios and edge cases. Existing
systems fail to effectively interpret semantic information within traffic
contexts and discern intentions of other participants, consequently generating
decisions misaligned with skilled drivers' reasoning patterns. We present LeAD,
a dual-rate autonomous driving architecture integrating imitation
learning-based end-to-end (E2E) frameworks with large language model (LLM)
augmentation. The high-frequency E2E subsystem maintains real-time
perception-planning-control cycles, while the low-frequency LLM module enhances
scenario comprehension through multi-modal perception fusion with HD maps and
derives optimal decisions via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning when baseline
planners encounter capability limitations. Our experimental evaluation in the
CARLA Simulator demonstrates LeAD's superior handling of unconventional

Motivation: 解决抓取姿态检测（GPD）中因依赖大规模数据集导致的数据隐私和集中化问题，以及联邦学习（FL）在GPD中因大模型通信开销高而受限的挑战。

Method: 通过分析GPD模型功能组件的学习动态，识别收敛较慢的模块，并在两阶段训练中优先优化这些模块，以减少通信成本。

Result: 在GraspNet-1B数据集和真实机器人实验中，该方法优于标准FedAvg和其他基线，实现了更高的准确率和抓取成功率。

Conclusion: 该框架在通信成本和模型性能之间取得了更好的平衡，为去中心化训练鲁棒的GPD模型提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Grasp pose detection (GPD) is a fundamental capability for robotic autonomy,
but its reliance on large, diverse datasets creates significant data privacy
and centralization challenges. Federated Learning (FL) offers a
privacy-preserving solution, but its application to GPD is hindered by the
substantial communication overhead of large models, a key issue for
resource-constrained robots. To address this, we propose a novel module-wise FL
framework that begins by analyzing the learning dynamics of the GPD model's
functional components. This analysis identifies slower-converging modules, to
which our framework then allocates additional communication effort. This is
realized through a two-phase process: a standard full-model training phase is
followed by a communication-efficient phase where only the identified subset of
slower-converging modules is trained and their partial updates are aggregated.
Extensive experiments on the GraspNet-1B dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms standard FedAvg and other baselines, achieving higher accuracy for
a given communication budget. Furthermore, real-world experiments on a physical
robot validate our approach, showing a superior grasp success rate compared to
baseline methods in cluttered scenes. Our work presents a
communication-efficient framework for training robust, generalized GPD models
in a decentralized manner, effectively improving the trade-off between
communication cost and model performance.

Result: Dijkstra在路径成本、计算时间和内存消耗上表现最稳定高效。

Conclusion: Dijkstra算法适用于静态地形导航，为动态路径规划研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation in unstructured environments, such as forests
and mountainous regions, presents significant challenges due to irregular
terrain and complex road conditions. This work provides a comparative
evaluation of mainstream and well-established path planning algorithms applied
to weighted pixel-level road networks derived from high-resolution satellite
imagery and airborne LiDAR data. For 2D road-map navigation, where the weights
reflect road conditions and terrain difficulty, A*, Dijkstra, RRT*, and a Novel
Improved Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (NIACO) are tested on the DeepGlobe
satellite dataset. For 3D road-map path planning, 3D A*, 3D Dijkstra,
RRT-Connect, and NIACO are evaluated using the Hamilton airborne LiDAR dataset,
which provides detailed elevation information. All algorithms are assessed
under identical start and end point conditions, focusing on path cost,
computation time, and memory consumption. Results demonstrate that Dijkstra
consistently offers the most stable and efficient performance in both 2D and 3D
scenarios, particularly when operating on dense, pixel-level geospatial
road-maps. These findings highlight the reliability of Dijkstra-based planning
for static terrain navigation and establish a foundation for future research on
dynamic path planning under complex environmental constraints.

However, existing methods often struggle to generate feasible grasp poses for
small objects or delicate components, potentially causing the entire pipeline

which introduces improvements in three key aspects. First, we introduce
multiple network modifications to enhance the ability of to handle delicate
regions. Second, we address the issue of label imbalance and propose a refined
graspness label normalization strategy. Third, we introduce a new simulated
grasp dataset and show that mixed sim-to-real training further improves grasp
performance. Experimental results show significant improvements, especially in
grasping small objects, and confirm the effectiveness of our system in semantic
grasping.

Conclusion: 这是首个在高仿真模型上验证的机器人CVC系统，展示了临床转化的潜力。

Abstract: Purpose: Central venous catheterization (CVC) is a critical medical procedure
for vascular access, hemodynamic monitoring, and life-saving interventions. Its
success remains challenging due to the need for continuous ultrasound-guided
visualization of a target vessel and approaching needle, which is further
complicated by anatomical variability and operator dependency. Errors in needle
placement can lead to life-threatening complications. While robotic systems
offer a potential solution, achieving full autonomy remains challenging. In
this work, we propose an end-to-end robotic-ultrasound-guided CVC pipeline,
from scan initialization to needle insertion. Methods: We introduce a
deep-learning model to identify clinically relevant anatomical landmarks from a
depth image of the patient's neck, obtained using RGB-D camera, to autonomously
define the scanning region and paths. Then, a robot motion planning framework
is proposed to scan, segment, reconstruct, and localize vessels (veins and
arteries), followed by the identification of the optimal insertion zone.
Finally, a needle guidance module plans the insertion under ultrasound guidance
with operator's feedback. This pipeline was validated on a high-fidelity
commercial phantom across 10 simulated clinical scenarios. Results: The
proposed pipeline achieved 10 out of 10 successful needle placements on the
first attempt. Vessels were reconstructed with a mean error of 2.15
\textit{mm}, and autonomous needle insertion was performed with an error less
than or close to 1 \textit{mm}. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first
robotic CVC system demonstrated on a high-fidelity phantom with integrated
planning, scanning, and insertion. Experimental results show its potential for
clinical translation.

Conclusion: 实时语音工作负荷估计是开发自适应人机系统的关键。

Abstract: Demanding task environments (e.g., supervising a remotely piloted aircraft)
require performing tasks quickly and accurately; however, periods of low and
high operator workload can decrease task performance. Intelligent modulation of
the system's demands and interaction modality in response to changes in
operator workload state may increase performance by avoiding undesirable
workload states. This system requires real-time estimation of each workload
component (i.e., cognitive, physical, visual, speech, and auditory) to adapt
the correct modality. Existing workload systems estimate multiple workload
components post-hoc, but few estimate speech workload, or function in
real-time. An algorithm to estimate speech workload and mitigate undesirable
workload states in real-time is presented. An analysis of the algorithm's
accuracy is presented, along with the results demonstrating the algorithm's
generalizability across individuals and human-machine teaming paradigms.
Real-time speech workload estimation is a crucial element towards developing
adaptive human-machine systems.

Conclusion: 软机器人能安全高效完成高难度清洁任务。

Abstract: Scrubbing surfaces is a physically demanding and time-intensive task.
Removing adhered contamination requires substantial friction generated through
pressure and torque or high lateral forces. Rigid robotic manipulators, while
capable of exerting these forces, are usually confined to structured
environments isolated from humans due to safety risks. In contrast, soft robot
arms can safely work around humans and adapt to environmental uncertainty, but
typically struggle to transmit the continuous torques or lateral forces
necessary for scrubbing. Here, we demonstrate a soft robotic arm scrubbing
adhered residues using torque and pressure, a task traditionally challenging
for soft robots. We train a neural network to learn the arm's inverse
kinematics and elasticity, which enables open-loop force and position control.
Using this learned model, the robot successfully scrubbed burnt food residue
from a plate and sticky fruit preserve from a toilet seat, removing an average
of 99.7% of contamination. This work demonstrates how soft robots, capable of
exerting continuous torque, can effectively and safely scrub challenging
contamination from surfaces.

Abstract: In disaster response or surveillance operations, quickly identifying areas
needing urgent attention is critical, but deploying response teams to every
location is inefficient or often impossible. Effective performance in this
domain requires coordinating a multi-robot inspection team to prioritize
inspecting locations more likely to need immediate response, while also
minimizing travel time. This is particularly challenging because robots must
directly observe the locations to determine which ones require additional
attention. This work introduces a multi-robot planning framework for
coordinated time-critical multi-robot search under uncertainty. Our approach
uses a graph neural network to estimate the likelihood of PoIs needing
attention from noisy sensor data and then uses those predictions to guide a
multi-robot model-based planner to determine the cost-effective plan. Simulated
experiments demonstrate that our planner improves performance at least by
16.3\%, 26.7\%, and 26.2\% for 1, 3, and 5 robots, respectively, compared to
non-learned and learned baselines. We also validate our approach on real-world
platforms using quad-copters.

Abstract: A novel algorithm is presented for the estimation of collision probabilities
between dynamic objects with uncertain trajectories, where the trajectories are
given as a sequence of poses with Gaussian distributions. We propose an

algorithm capable of estimating the collision probability with a median error
of 3.5%, and a median runtime of 0.21ms, when measured on an Intel Xeon Gold
6226R Processor. Importantly, the algorithm explicitly accounts for the

Finally, the method is tested on a diverse set of relevant real-world

Abstract: Perching on structures such as trees, beams, and ledges is essential for
extending the endurance of aerial robots by enabling energy conservation in
standby or observation modes. A tethered tensile perching mechanism offers a
simple, adaptable solution that can be retrofitted to existing robots and
accommodates a variety of structure sizes and shapes. However, tethered tensile
perching introduces significant modelling challenges which require precise
management of aerial robot dynamics, including the cases of tether slack &
tension, and momentum transfer. Achieving smooth wrapping and secure anchoring
by targeting a specific tether segment adds further complexity. In this work,
we present a novel trajectory framework for tethered tensile perching,
utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) through the Soft Actor-Critic from
Demonstrations (SACfD) algorithm. By incorporating both optimal and suboptimal
demonstrations, our approach enhances training efficiency and responsiveness,
achieving precise control over position and velocity. This framework enables
the aerial robot to accurately target specific tether segments, facilitating
reliable wrapping and secure anchoring. We validate our framework through
extensive simulation and real-world experiments, and demonstrate effectiveness

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于4通道双边控制的力反馈远程操作系统，适用于低成本机械臂，并展示了其在快速或接触丰富任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有远程操作系统多采用单边控制，缺乏力反馈，难以应对快速或接触丰富的任务。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用4通道双边控制，结合非线性补偿、速度和外力估计以及可变增益，实现力反馈远程操作。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在快速或接触丰富的任务中表现优异，且将力信息融入模仿学习策略可提升性能。

Conclusion: 该系统在低成本硬件上实现了高保真远程操作和数据收集，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of imitation learning has led to increased
interest in teleoperating low-cost manipulators to collect demonstration data.
However, most existing systems rely on unilateral control, which only transmits
target position values. While this approach is easy to implement and suitable
for slow, non-contact tasks, it struggles with fast or contact-rich operations
due to the absence of force feedback. This work demonstrates that fast
teleoperation with force feedback is feasible even with force-sensorless,
low-cost manipulators by leveraging 4-channel bilateral control. Based on
accurately identified manipulator dynamics, our method integrates nonlinear
terms compensation, velocity and external force estimation, and variable gain
corresponding to inertial variation. Furthermore, using data collected by
4-channel bilateral control, we show that incorporating force information into
both the input and output of learned policies improves performance in imitation
learning. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of our system for
high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware.

Method: 通过实验分析任务多样性、体现多样性和专家多样性的作用，并提出分布去偏方法。

Result: 任务多样性比单任务数据量更重要；多体现数据对跨体现迁移非必需；专家多样性可能干扰学习。提出的方法提升性能15%。

Conclusion: 研究为机器人操作数据集的有效扩展提供了新视角和实用指导。

Abstract: Data scaling has driven remarkable success in foundation models for Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), yet the principles of
effective data scaling in robotic manipulation remain insufficiently
understood. In this work, we investigate the nuanced role of data diversity in
robot learning by examining three critical dimensions-task (what to do),
embodiment (which robot to use), and expert (who demonstrates)-challenging the
conventional intuition of "more diverse is better". Throughout extensive
experiments on various robot platforms, we reveal that (1) task diversity
proves more critical than per-task demonstration quantity, benefiting transfer
from diverse pre-training tasks to novel downstream scenarios; (2)
multi-embodiment pre-training data is optional for cross-embodiment
transfer-models trained on high-quality single-embodiment data can efficiently
transfer to different platforms, showing more desirable scaling property during
fine-tuning than multi-embodiment pre-trained models; and (3) expert diversity,
arising from individual operational preferences and stochastic variations in
human demonstrations, can be confounding to policy learning, with velocity
multimodality emerging as a key contributing factor. Based on this insight, we
propose a distribution debiasing method to mitigate velocity ambiguity, the
yielding GO-1-Pro achieves substantial performance gains of 15%, equivalent to
using 2.5 times pre-training data. Collectively, these findings provide new
perspectives and offer practical guidance on how to scale robotic manipulation
datasets effectively.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖低层动作标注数据或局限于刚性物体场景，难以处理变形物体、遮挡和非位移任务。

Method: 提出EC-Flow框架，结合体现的固有运动学特性，并通过目标对齐模块连接语言指令和物体交互。

Result: 在模拟和真实任务中，EC-Flow在遮挡物体处理（提升62%）、变形物体操作（提升45%）和非位移任务（提升80%）上表现优异。

Conclusion: EC-Flow通过体现中心流和目标对齐模块，显著提升了机器人操作的泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: Current language-guided robotic manipulation systems often require low-level
action-labeled datasets for imitation learning. While object-centric flow
prediction methods mitigate this issue, they remain limited to scenarios
involving rigid objects with clear displacement and minimal occlusion. In this
work, we present Embodiment-Centric Flow (EC-Flow), a framework that directly
learns manipulation from action-unlabeled videos by predicting
embodiment-centric flow. Our key insight is that incorporating the embodiment's
inherent kinematics significantly enhances generalization to versatile
manipulation scenarios, including deformable object handling, occlusions, and
non-object-displacement tasks. To connect the EC-Flow with language
instructions and object interactions, we further introduce a goal-alignment
module by jointly optimizing movement consistency and goal-image prediction.
Moreover, translating EC-Flow to executable robot actions only requires a
standard robot URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file to specify
kinematic constraints across joints, which makes it easy to use in practice. We
validate EC-Flow on both simulation (Meta-World) and real-world tasks,
demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance in occluded object handling (62%
improvement), deformable object manipulation (45% improvement), and
non-object-displacement tasks (80% improvement) than prior state-of-the-art
object-centric flow methods. For more information, see our project website at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为3DGeoMeshNet的新型GCN框架，通过各向异性卷积层直接在空间域中学习全局和局部特征，避免了传统方法对中间表示的依赖，提高了3D网格重建的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D网格在计算机视觉和图形应用中至关重要，但传统CNN难以处理其非欧几里得特性。现有GCN方法多依赖各向同性滤波器或谱分解，无法同时捕捉局部和全局特征。

Method: 提出3DGeoMeshNet框架，采用各向异性卷积层和多尺度编码器-解码器结构，直接在原始多边形网格格式上进行操作。

Result: 在COMA人脸数据集上的实验表明，该方法在重建精度上表现优异。

Conclusion: 3DGeoMeshNet通过直接在空间域中学习特征，避免了中间表示转换，显著提升了3D网格重建的准确性。

Abstract: 3D meshes are fundamental data representations for capturing complex
geometric shapes in computer vision and graphics applications. While
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have excelled in structured data like
images, extending them to irregular 3D meshes is challenging due to the
non-Euclidean nature of the data. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) offer a
solution by applying convolutions to graph-structured data, but many existing
methods rely on isotropic filters or spectral decomposition, limiting their
ability to capture both local and global mesh features. In this paper, we
introduce 3D Geometric Mesh Network (3DGeoMeshNet), a novel GCN-based framework
that uses anisotropic convolution layers to effectively learn both global and
local features directly in the spatial domain. Unlike previous approaches that
convert meshes into intermediate representations like voxel grids or point
clouds, our method preserves the original polygonal mesh format throughout the
reconstruction process, enabling more accurate shape reconstruction. Our
architecture features a multi-scale encoder-decoder structure, where separate
global and local pathways capture both large-scale geometric structures and
fine-grained local details. Extensive experiments on the COMA dataset
containing human faces demonstrate the efficiency of 3DGeoMeshNet in terms of
reconstruction accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法需要高质量图像覆盖整个场景，限制了普通用户的可用性。LighthouseGS旨在通过简单的全景运动实现高保真渲染。

Method: 利用粗略几何先验（如相机姿态和单目深度估计）和室内平面结构，提出平面支架组装初始化方法和稳定剪枝策略，并引入几何和光度校正。

Result: 在真实和合成室内场景测试中，LighthouseGS实现了逼真渲染，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LighthouseGS展示了全景视图合成和物体放置的潜力，为普通用户提供了便捷的高质量渲染方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled real-time novel
view synthesis (NVS) with impressive quality in indoor scenes. However,
achieving high-fidelity rendering requires meticulously captured images
covering the entire scene, limiting accessibility for general users. We aim to
develop a practical 3DGS-based NVS framework using simple panorama-style motion
with a handheld camera (e.g., mobile device). While convenient, this
rotation-dominant motion and narrow baseline make accurate camera pose and 3D
point estimation challenging, especially in textureless indoor scenes. To
address these challenges, we propose LighthouseGS, a novel framework inspired
by the lighthouse-like sweeping motion of panoramic views. LighthouseGS
leverages rough geometric priors, such as mobile device camera poses and
monocular depth estimation, and utilizes the planar structures often found in
indoor environments. We present a new initialization method called plane
scaffold assembly to generate consistent 3D points on these structures,
followed by a stable pruning strategy to enhance geometry and optimization
stability. Additionally, we introduce geometric and photometric corrections to
resolve inconsistencies from motion drift and auto-exposure in mobile devices.
Tested on collected real and synthetic indoor scenes, LighthouseGS delivers
photorealistic rendering, surpassing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating
the potential for panoramic view synthesis and object placement.

TL;DR: Chat2SPaT利用大型语言模型（LLMs）将用户对交通信号控制计划的半结构化描述转换为精确的信号相位和时序（SPaT）结果，准确率超过94%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少交通信号控制计划管理中的重复性手动工作，提高效率和用户友好性。

Method: 通过LLMs理解用户描述并生成json格式的相位序列和属性，再用Python脚本组装完整信号控制计划。

Result: 在300多个测试案例中，准确率超过94%（中英文均适用）。

Conclusion: Chat2SPaT为交通领域提供了一个易用的LLM应用工具，可作为ITS中更广泛应用的基石。

Abstract: Pre-timed traffic signal control, commonly used for operating signalized
intersections and coordinated arterials, requires tedious manual work for
signaling plan creating and updating. When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans
are utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading
to further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a
user-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study
proposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous
descriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT)
results, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or
ring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS)
software and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first
leverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan
descriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and
phase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python
scripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic
signal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan.
Within a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan
editing. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of
over 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300
plan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of
understanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an
easy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers,
serving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile
application of LLMs in the field of ITS. The source codes, prompts and test
dataset are openly accessible at https://github.com/yuewangits/Chat2SPaT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的法律知识表示模型（如LegalRuleML）在表达空间约束、子类关系和例外结构方面存在不足，OLG++旨在填补这一空白。

Method: OLG++扩展了OLG，增加了空间、时间、群体、可废止性和逻辑分组等节点和边类型，支持上下文条件、优先级和复杂触发器的结构化推理。

Result: OLG++在食品业务法规示例中展示了其表达能力，并通过属性图查询支持法律问题回答。它比现有的基于图的法律知识表示模型更具表达力。

Conclusion: OLG++通过引入丰富的语义扩展，显著提升了法律知识表示的灵活性和表达能力，适用于复杂的法律规则建模。

Abstract: We present OLG++, a semantic extension of the Obligation Logic Graph (OLG)
for modeling regulatory and legal rules in municipal and interjurisdictional
contexts. OLG++ introduces richer node and edge types, including spatial,
temporal, party group, defeasibility, and logical grouping constructs, enabling
nuanced representations of legal obligations, exceptions, and hierarchies. The
model supports structured reasoning over rules with contextual conditions,
precedence, and complex triggers. We demonstrate its expressiveness through
examples from food business regulations, showing how OLG++ supports legal
question answering using property graph queries. OLG++ also improves over
LegalRuleML by providing native support for subClassOf, spatial constraints,
and reified exception structures. Our examples show that OLG++ is more
expressive than prior graph-based models for legal knowledge representation.

Abstract: Effectively evaluating deep research agents that autonomously search the web,
analyze information, and generate reports remains a major challenge,
particularly when it comes to assessing long reports and giving detailed
feedback on their intermediate steps. To address these gaps, we introduce Deep
Research Comparator, a platform that offers a holistic framework for deep
research agent hosting, side-by-side comparison, fine-grained human feedback
collection, and ranking calculation. Given a user query, our platform displays
the final reports from two different agents along with their intermediate steps
during generation. Annotators can evaluate the overall quality of final reports
based on side-by-side comparison, and also provide detailed feedback separately
by assessing intermediate steps or specific text spans within the final report.
Furthermore, we develop Simple Deepresearch, an end-to-end agent scaffold. This
scaffold serves as a baseline that facilitates the easy integration of various
large language models to transform them into deep research agents for
evaluation. To demonstrate the platform's utility for deep research agent
development, we have collected real user preference data from 17 annotators on
three deep research agents. A demo video of our platform can be found at

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential for enabling AI-powered smart

Abstract: The second edition of the 2025 ImageCLEF MEDIQA-MAGIC challenge, co-organized
by researchers from Microsoft, Stanford University, and the Hospital Clinic of
Barcelona, focuses on multimodal dermatology question answering and
segmentation, using real-world patient queries and images. This work addresses
the Closed Visual Question Answering (CVQA) task, where the goal is to select
the correct answer to multiple-choice clinical questions based on both
user-submitted images and accompanying symptom descriptions. The proposed
approach combines three core components: (1) fine-tuning open-source multimodal
models from the Qwen, Gemma, and LLaMA families on the competition dataset, (2)
introducing a structured reasoning layer that reconciles and adjudicates
between candidate model outputs, and (3) incorporating agentic
retrieval-augmented generation (agentic RAG), which adds relevant information
from the American Academy of Dermatology's symptom and condition database to
fill in gaps in patient context. The team achieved second place with a
submission that scored sixth, demonstrating competitive performance and high
accuracy. Beyond competitive benchmarks, this research addresses a practical
challenge in telemedicine: diagnostic decisions must often be made
asynchronously, with limited input and with high accuracy and interpretability.
By emulating the systematic reasoning patterns employed by dermatologists when
evaluating skin conditions, this architecture provided a pathway toward more
reliable automated diagnostic support systems.

Result: 强调有效的AI红队测试需要多功能团队，以检查涌现风险、系统性漏洞及技术与社会因素的相互作用。

Conclusion: 通过更全面的红队测试框架，可以更好地应对AI系统中的复杂风险。

Abstract: Red teaming has evolved from its origins in military applications to become a
widely adopted methodology in cybersecurity and AI. In this paper, we take a
critical look at the practice of AI red teaming. We argue that despite its
current popularity in AI governance, there exists a significant gap between red
teaming's original intent as a critical thinking exercise and its narrow focus
on discovering model-level flaws in the context of generative AI. Current AI
red teaming efforts focus predominantly on individual model vulnerabilities
while overlooking the broader sociotechnical systems and emergent behaviors
that arise from complex interactions between models, users, and environments.
To address this deficiency, we propose a comprehensive framework
operationalizing red teaming in AI systems at two levels: macro-level system
red teaming spanning the entire AI development lifecycle, and micro-level model
red teaming. Drawing on cybersecurity experience and systems theory, we further
propose a set of recommendations. In these, we emphasize that effective AI red
teaming requires multifunctional teams that examine emergent risks, systemic
vulnerabilities, and the interplay between technical and social factors.

Motivation: 反事实解释（CFs）能为机器学习预测提供直观解释，用于异常预防和增强数据训练。本研究旨在探索LLMs在生成CFs中的潜力。

Method: 在零样本和三样本设置下，使用GPT-4o-mini生成CFs，并在两个数据集（压力预测和心脏病检测）上评估其性能。

Result: LLM生成的CFs在合理性（99%）、有效性（0.99）和稀疏性上优于传统方法（如DiCE、CFNOW、NICE），且作为增强数据可提升分类器准确率（平均5%）。

Conclusion: 基于提示的生成技术能显著提升临床和生理预测任务的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFs) offer human-centric insights into machine
learning predictions by highlighting minimal changes required to alter an
outcome. Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality
prevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. In this work, we
explore large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o-mini, for generating
CFs in a zero-shot and three-shot setting. We evaluate our approach on two
datasets: the AI-Readi flagship dataset for stress prediction and a public
dataset for heart disease detection. Compared to traditional methods such as
DiCE, CFNOW, and NICE, our few-shot LLM-based approach achieves high
plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and competitive
sparsity. Moreover, using LLM-generated CFs as augmented samples improves
downstream classifier performance (an average accuracy gain of 5%), especially
in low-data regimes. This demonstrates the potential of prompt-based generative
techniques to enhance explainability and robustness in clinical and
physiological prediction tasks. Code base: github.com/anonymous/SenseCF.

*David Bensaïd,Noam Rotstein,Roy Velich,Daniel Bensaïd,Ron Kimmel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SingLoRA提出了一种改进的低秩适应方法，通过单低秩矩阵分解消除矩阵间尺度冲突，提升训练稳定性并减少参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LoRA中矩阵尺度差异导致的训练不稳定和性能不佳问题。

Method: 将权重更新分解为单低秩矩阵与其转置的乘积，避免尺度冲突。

Result: 在多个任务中表现优异，如LLama 7B在MNLI上达到91.3%准确率，参数仅需60%。

Conclusion: SingLoRA通过简单设计显著提升低秩适应的效率和性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has significantly advanced parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of large pretrained models. LoRA augments the pre-trained weights
of a model by adding the product of two smaller matrices that together form a
low-rank matrix update. Recent research has shown that scale disparities
between these two matrices often cause unstable training dynamics, leading to
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose SingLoRA, which reformulates
low-rank adaptation by learning the weights update as a decomposition of a
single low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose. This simple design
inherently removes inter-matrix scale conflicts, ensuring stable optimization,
and roughly halves the parameter count. We analyze SingLoRA within the
infinite-width neural network framework, showing that it guarantees stable
feature learning by construction. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks
validate these benefits. In common sense reasoning, fine-tuning LLama 7B on
MNLI with SingLoRA achieves 91.3% accuracy - surpassing LoRA (89.1%) and LoRA+
(90.2%) - while using only 60% of their parameter budget. In image generation,
fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with SingLoRA significantly improves image
fidelity on DreamBooth, achieving a DINO similarity score of 0.151, compared to
scores of 0.148 and 0.143 for DoRA and LoRA, respectively.

Abstract: We motivate and outline a programme for a formal theory of measurement of

allow researchers, practitioners, and regulators to: (i) make comparisons
between systems and the evaluation methods applied to them; (ii) connect
frontier AI evaluations with established quantitative risk analysis techniques
drawn from engineering and safety science; and (iii) foreground how what counts
as AI capability is contingent upon the measurement operations and scales we
elect to use. We sketch a layered measurement stack, distinguish direct from
indirect observables, and signpost how these ingredients provide a pathway
toward a unified, calibratable taxonomy of AI phenomena.

Abstract: Automated depression diagnosis aims to analyze multimodal information from
interview videos to predict participants' depression scores. Previous studies
often lack clear explanations of how these scores were determined, limiting
their adoption in clinical practice. While the advent of LLMs provides a
possible pathway for explainable depression diagnosis, current LLMs capable of
processing multimodal data lack training on interview data, resulting in poor
diagnostic performance when used directly. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal large language model (MLlm-DR) that can understand multimodal
information inputs and supports explainable depression diagnosis. MLlm-DR
integrates a smaller LLMs and a lightweight query module (LQ-former).
Specifically, the smaller LLMs is designed to generate depression scores and
corresponding evaluation rationales. To enhance its logical reasoning for
domain-specific tasks while maintaining practicality, we constructed a robust
training dataset to fine-tune it. Meanwhile, the LQ-former captures
depression-related features from speech and visual data, aiding the model's
ability to process multimodal information, to achieve comprehensive depression
diagnosis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two
interview-based benchmark datasets, CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ, demonstrating its
effectiveness and superiority.

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) are opening up new
opportunities in geotechnical engineering and engineering geology. While
general-purpose LLMs possess broad capabilities, effective application in
geotechnics often requires domain-specific adaptation. Such tailored LLMs are
increasingly employed to streamline geotechnical workflows. This paper presents
the first survey of the adaptation and application of LLMs in geotechnical
engineering. It outlines key methodologies for adaptation to geotechnical
domain, including prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation,
domain-adaptive pretraining, and fine-tuning. The survey examines the
state-of-the-art applications of geotechnical-adapted LLMs, including
geological interpretation, subsurface characterization, site planning, design
calculations, numerical modeling, safety and risk assessment, and educational
tutoring. It also analyzes benefits and limitations of geotechnical-adapted
LLMs, and identifies promising directions for future research in this
interdisciplinary discipline. The findings serve as a valuable resource for
practitioners seeking to integrate LLMs into geotechnical practice, while also
providing a foundation to stimulate further investigation within the academic
community.

Motivation: 解决多模态数据中因传感器故障或数据不完整导致的模态缺失问题，避免传统方法的重建不精确和过耦合。

Method: 独立训练各模态特征提取网络，利用注意力扩散网络生成缺失模态特征，保持多模态分布真实性。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MIntRec基准测试中取得最优结果，适用于缺失和完整模态场景。

Conclusion: ADMC模型在多模态情感与意图识别中表现优异，尤其在缺失模态情况下效果显著。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion and intent recognition is essential for automated
human-computer interaction, It aims to analyze users' speech, text, and visual
information to predict their emotions or intent. One of the significant
challenges is that missing modalities due to sensor malfunctions or incomplete
data. Traditional methods that attempt to reconstruct missing information often
suffer from over-coupling and imprecise generation processes, leading to
suboptimal outcomes. To address these issues, we introduce an Attention-based
Diffusion model for Missing Modalities feature Completion (ADMC). Our framework
independently trains feature extraction networks for each modality, preserving
their unique characteristics and avoiding over-coupling. The Attention-based
Diffusion Network (ADN) generates missing modality features that closely align
with authentic multimodal distribution, enhancing performance across all
missing-modality scenarios. Moreover, ADN's cross-modal generation offers
improved recognition even in full-modality contexts. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP and MIntRec benchmarks, demonstrating
its effectiveness in both missing and complete modality scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决教师生成高质量检索练习问题耗时耗力的问题，探索LLM自动化生成问题的有效性。

Method: 通过两个大学数据科学课程的实证研究，比较学生使用LLM生成的多选题与无练习时的学习效果。

Result: 使用LLM生成问题的学生知识保留率显著提高（89% vs 73%）。

Conclusion: LLM生成的检索练习问题可有效支持学习，但需教师手动验证以确保质量。

Abstract: Retrieval practice is a well-established pedagogical technique known to
significantly enhance student learning and knowledge retention. However,
generating high-quality retrieval practice questions is often time-consuming
and labor intensive for instructors, especially in rapidly evolving technical
subjects. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this
process by generating questions in response to prompts, yet the effectiveness
of LLM-generated retrieval practice on student learning remains to be
established. In this study, we conducted an empirical study involving two
college-level data science courses, with approximately 60 students. We compared
learning outcomes during one week in which students received LLM-generated
multiple-choice retrieval practice questions to those from a week in which no
such questions were provided. Results indicate that students exposed to
LLM-generated retrieval practice achieved significantly higher knowledge
retention, with an average accuracy of 89%, compared to 73% in the week without
such practice. These findings suggest that LLM-generated retrieval questions
can effectively support student learning and may provide a scalable solution
for integrating retrieval practice into real-time teaching. However, despite
these encouraging outcomes and the potential time-saving benefits, cautions
must be taken, as the quality of LLM-generated questions can vary. Instructors
must still manually verify and revise the generated questions before releasing
them to students.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前LLM模拟的局限性，并展示了SIP-CoT和情感记忆在提升社交智能方面的潜力。

Abstract: The exponential growth of social media and generative AI has transformed
information dissemination, fostering connectivity but also accelerating the
spread of misinformation. Understanding information propagation dynamics and
developing effective control strategies is essential to mitigate harmful
content. Traditional models, such as SIR, provide basic insights but
inadequately capture the complexities of online interactions. Advanced methods,
including attention mechanisms and graph neural networks, enhance accuracy but
typically overlook user psychology and behavioral dynamics. Large language
models (LLMs), with their human-like reasoning, offer new potential for
simulating psychological aspects of information spread. We introduce an
LLM-based simulation environment capturing agents' evolving attitudes,
emotions, and responses. Initial experiments, however, revealed significant
gaps between LLM-generated behaviors and authentic human dynamics, especially
in stance detection and psychological realism. A detailed evaluation through
Social Information Processing Theory identified major discrepancies in
goal-setting and feedback evaluation, stemming from the lack of emotional
processing in standard LLM training. To address these issues, we propose the
Social Information Processing-based Chain of Thought (SIP-CoT) mechanism
enhanced by emotion-guided memory. This method improves the interpretation of
social cues, personalization of goals, and evaluation of feedback. Experimental
results confirm that SIP-CoT-enhanced LLM agents more effectively process
social information, demonstrating behaviors, attitudes, and emotions closer to
real human interactions. In summary, this research highlights critical
limitations in current LLM-based propagation simulations and demonstrates how
integrating SIP-CoT and emotional memory significantly enhances the social
intelligence and realism of LLM agents.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于司法数据的城市级外国直接投资（FDI）预测方法（TLJD），通过整合司法绩效指标，解决了传统经济数据易被操纵的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 为促进联合国可持续发展目标中的经济增长，FDI是关键因素。传统基于经济数据的预测方法不可靠，因此尝试利用司法数据提高预测准确性。

Method: 构建了一个基于1200万份公开裁决文件的司法绩效评估指标体系，提出TLJD方法，结合行数据和列数据进行指标编码，并利用专家混合模型调整权重。

Result: 在跨城市和跨时间任务中，TLJD表现优异（R2至少0.92），优于其他十种先进基线方法。

Conclusion: TLJD通过司法数据显著提升了FDI预测的可靠性，为地方政府提供了更准确的决策支持。

Abstract: To advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on promoting
sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, foreign direct
investment (FDI) plays a crucial role in catalyzing economic expansion and
fostering innovation. Precise city-level FDI prediction is quite important for
local government and is commonly studied based on economic data (e.g., GDP).
However, such economic data could be prone to manipulation, making predictions
less reliable. To address this issue, we try to leverage large-scale judicial
data which reflects judicial performance influencing local investment security
and returns, for city-level FDI prediction. Based on this, we first build an
index system for the evaluation of judicial performance over twelve million
publicly available adjudication documents according to which a tabular dataset
is reformulated. We then propose a new Tabular Learning method on Judicial Data
(TLJD) for city-level FDI prediction. TLJD integrates row data and column data
in our built tabular dataset for judicial performance indicator encoding, and
utilizes a mixture of experts model to adjust the weights of different
indicators considering regional variations. To validate the effectiveness of
TLJD, we design cross-city and cross-time tasks for city-level FDI predictions.
Extensive experiments on both tasks demonstrate the superiority of TLJD (reach
to at least 0.92 R2) over the other ten state-of-the-art baselines in different
evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 随着AI在医疗领域的扩展，评估其生成的临床计划的质量成为关键挑战，尤其是新型推理模型的出现。

Method: 由10位皮肤科医生、通用AI（GPT-4o）和推理AI（o3）为5个复杂皮肤病案例生成治疗计划，匿名后由人类专家和高级AI（Gemini 2.5 Pro）评分。

Result: 人类专家评分显著高于AI计划，而AI评委则完全相反，推理AI（o3）被AI评委评为最佳。

Conclusion: 临床计划的质量感知取决于评估者类型，揭示了经验启发式与数据驱动逻辑之间的差距，未来需发展可解释的人机协同系统。

Abstract: Background: Evaluating AI-generated treatment plans is a key challenge as AI
expands beyond diagnostics, especially with new reasoning models. This study
compares plans from human experts and two AI models (a generalist and a
reasoner), assessed by both human peers and a superior AI judge.
  Methods: Ten dermatologists, a generalist AI (GPT-4o), and a reasoning AI
(o3) generated treatment plans for five complex dermatology cases. The
anonymized, normalized plans were scored in two phases: 1) by the ten human
experts, and 2) by a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) using an identical
rubric.
  Results: A profound 'evaluator effect' was observed. Human experts scored
peer-generated plans significantly higher than AI plans (mean 7.62 vs. 7.16;
p=0.0313), ranking GPT-4o 6th (mean 7.38) and the reasoning model, o3, 11th
(mean 6.97). Conversely, the AI judge produced a complete inversion, scoring AI
plans significantly higher than human plans (mean 7.75 vs. 6.79; p=0.0313). It
ranked o3 1st (mean 8.20) and GPT-4o 2nd, placing all human experts lower.
  Conclusions: The perceived quality of a clinical plan is fundamentally
dependent on the evaluator's nature. An advanced reasoning AI, ranked poorly by
human experts, was judged as superior by a sophisticated AI, revealing a deep
gap between experience-based clinical heuristics and data-driven algorithmic
logic. This paradox presents a critical challenge for AI integration,
suggesting the future requires synergistic, explainable human-AI systems that
bridge this reasoning gap to augment clinical care.

Motivation: 解决AI模型在临床实践中因真实世界变化（如硬件、光照或人口统计差异）导致的性能下降问题，提供可访问且可解释的可靠性审计工具。

Method: ModelAuditor通过多智能体架构与用户交互，选择任务特定指标，模拟临床相关分布偏移，并生成解释性报告。

Result: 在三个真实临床场景中，ModelAuditor成功识别失败模式，恢复15-25%的性能损失，优于基线模型和现有增强方法。

Conclusion: ModelAuditor提供了一种高效、低成本的方法，显著提升AI模型在临床部署中的可靠性。

Abstract: The deployment of AI models in clinical practice faces a critical challenge:
models achieving expert-level performance on benchmarks can fail
catastrophically when confronted with real-world variations in medical imaging.
Minor shifts in scanner hardware, lighting or demographics can erode accuracy,
but currently reliability auditing to identify such catastrophic failure cases
before deployment is a bespoke and time-consuming process. Practitioners lack
accessible and interpretable tools to expose and repair hidden failure modes.
Here we introduce ModelAuditor, a self-reflective agent that converses with
users, selects task-specific metrics, and simulates context-dependent,
clinically relevant distribution shifts. ModelAuditor then generates
interpretable reports explaining how much performance likely degrades during
deployment, discussing specific likely failure modes and identifying root
causes and mitigation strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation across three
real-world clinical scenarios - inter-institutional variation in
histopathology, demographic shifts in dermatology, and equipment heterogeneity
in chest radiography - demonstrates that ModelAuditor is able correctly
identify context-specific failure modes of state-of-the-art models such as the
established SIIM-ISIC melanoma classifier. Its targeted recommendations recover
15-25% of performance lost under real-world distribution shift, substantially
outperforming both baseline models and state-of-the-art augmentation methods.
These improvements are achieved through a multi-agent architecture and execute
on consumer hardware in under 10 minutes, costing less than US$0.50 per audit.

Result: 实验数据显示，该方法在预测电池退化时平均绝对误差约1%，解释性评分接近0.9。

Conclusion: 该方法有望集成到电池管理系统（BMS）中，为持续优化电池管理提供新途径。

Abstract: Real-time monitoring of the state of health (SoH) of batteries remains a
major challenge, particularly in microgrids where operational constraints limit
the use of traditional methods. As part of the 4BLife project, we propose an
innovative method based on the analysis of a discharge pulse at the end of the
charge phase. The parameters of the equivalent electrical model describing the
voltage evolution across the battery terminals during this current pulse are
then used to estimate the SoH. Based on the experimental data acquired so far,
the initial results demonstrate the relevance of the proposed approach. After
training using the parameters of two batteries with a capacity degradation of
around 85%, we successfully predicted the degradation of two other batteries,
cycled down to approximately 90% SoH, with a mean absolute error of around 1%
in the worst case, and an explainability score of the estimator close to 0.9.
If these performances are confirmed, this method can be easily integrated into
battery management systems (BMS) and paves the way for optimized battery
management under continuous operation.

Conclusion: GTA1通过测试时缩放和强化学习方法显著提升了GUI代理的性能，为相关领域提供了开源代码和模型。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents autonomously operate across platforms
(e.g., Linux) to complete tasks by interacting with visual elements.
Specifically, a user instruction is decomposed into a sequence of action
proposals, each corresponding to an interaction with the GUI. After each
action, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step.
However, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning
(i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is
non-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in
complex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual
targets.
  This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI
Test-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate
action proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we
sample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to
evaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better
decision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and
improving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves
improved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its
corresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning
(RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments,
rewarding successful clicks on interface elements.
  Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks. For example, GTA1-7B achieves 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7%
accuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively. When
paired with a planner applying our test-time scaling strategy, it exhibits
state-of-the-art agentic performance (e.g., 45.2% task success rate on
OSWorld). We open-source our code and models here.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在ROP风险预测中的潜力，填补现有研究的空白，并研究情感因素对模型预测的影响。

Method: 使用CROP数据集，结合三种提示策略（Instruction-based、CoT、ICL）和情感元素，评估LLMs的预测能力和情感偏差。

Result: LLMs在仅依赖内部知识时表现有限，但结合外部知识后性能显著提升；情感偏差明显，但积极情感提示能减少偏差。

Conclusion: 情感敏感的提示工程对提高诊断可靠性至关重要，Affective-ROPTester为临床语言模型评估提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) across
various domains, their capacity to predict retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)
risk remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel
Chinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records
annotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels. To systematically examine the
predictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk
stratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation
framework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based,
Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme
assesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and
ICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy.
Crucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate
how different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP
and its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield
two principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP
risk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit
marked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs.
Second, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent
inclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared
to negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating
predictive bias in model outputs. These findings highlight the critical role of
affect-sensitive prompt engineering in enhancing diagnostic reliability and
emphasize the utility of Affective-ROPTester as a framework for evaluating and
mitigating affective bias in clinical language modeling systems.

Method: 结合认知心理学和前人研究，提出了一种新的模型CogniPlay，旨在模拟人类决策过程。

Result: CogniPlay是一个进行中的模型，目标是实现更接近人类的游戏决策行为。

Conclusion: 通过结合心理学和AI研究，CogniPlay有望填补AI与人类决策之间的差距。

Abstract: While AI systems have equaled or surpassed human performance in a wide
variety of games such as Chess, Go, or Dota 2, describing these systems as
truly "human-like" remains far-fetched. Despite their success, they fail to
replicate the pattern-based, intuitive decision-making processes observed in
human cognition. This paper presents an overview of findings from cognitive
psychology and previous efforts to model human-like behavior in artificial
agents, discusses their applicability to General Game Playing (GGP) and
introduces our work-in-progress model based on these observations: CogniPlay.

### [195] [Current Practices for Building LLM-Powered Reasoning Tools Are Ad Hoc -- and We Can Do Better](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05886)
*Aaron Bembenek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的计算模型——神经符号转移系统，用于构建神经符号自动推理工具，结合符号算法和大型语言模型，旨在提升推理能力并保留符号算法的强保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前构建神经符号自动推理系统的方法缺乏传统符号算法的强保证，且未能充分结合神经网络与符号推理的潜力。

Method: 提出神经符号转移系统，将符号状态与直觉配对，并行操作符号和直觉的状态转移。

Result: 该模型有望扩展逻辑推理能力，同时保留符号算法的强保证。

Conclusion: 神经符号转移系统为构建更强大的神经符号自动推理工具提供了理论基础，并可通过逻辑编程语言实现。

Abstract: There is growing excitement about building software verifiers, synthesizers,
and other Automated Reasoning (AR) tools by combining traditional symbolic
algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs). Unfortunately, the current
practice for constructing such neurosymbolic AR systems is an ad hoc
programming model that does not have the strong guarantees of traditional
symbolic algorithms, nor a deep enough synchronization of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to unlock the full potential of LLM-powered reasoning. I
propose Neurosymbolic Transition Systems as a principled computational model
that can underlie infrastructure for building neurosymbolic AR tools. In this
model, symbolic state is paired with intuition, and state transitions operate
over symbols and intuition in parallel. I argue why this new paradigm can scale
logical reasoning beyond current capabilities while retaining the strong
guarantees of symbolic algorithms, and I sketch out how the computational model
I propose can be reified in a logic programming language.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分解时间序列预测流程的方法，通过三个阶段（输入序列表示、信息提取与记忆构建、目标投影）优化模型性能，并在多个基准数据集上取得最佳预测精度和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测仍面临序列表示、信息提取和目标投影的挑战，不同数据集和配置构成独特任务，需针对性解决。

Method: 将预测流程分解为三个阶段，分别研究不同架构配置（如卷积层和自注意力机制），并在七个基准数据集上评估。

Result: 模型实现了最先进的预测精度，同时显著提升计算效率，减少训练和推理时间及参数数量。

Conclusion: 通过分解和优化预测流程，论文提出的方法在精度和效率上均取得显著提升，代码已开源。

Abstract: With the advent of Transformers, time series forecasting has seen significant
advances, yet it remains challenging due to the need for effective sequence
representation, memory construction, and accurate target projection. Time
series forecasting remains a challenging task, demanding effective sequence
representation, meaningful information extraction, and precise future
projection. Each dataset and forecasting configuration constitutes a distinct
task, each posing unique challenges the model must overcome to produce accurate
predictions. To systematically address these task-specific difficulties, this
work decomposes the time series forecasting pipeline into three core stages:
input sequence representation, information extraction and memory construction,
and final target projection. Within each stage, we investigate a range of
architectural configurations to assess the effectiveness of various modules,
such as convolutional layers for feature extraction and self-attention
mechanisms for information extraction, across diverse forecasting tasks,
including evaluations on seven benchmark datasets. Our models achieve
state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while greatly enhancing computational
efficiency, with reduced training and inference times and a lower parameter
count. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出MusiScene模型，通过音乐场景想象任务（MSI）生成与音乐匹配的场景描述，并用于提升视频背景音乐生成（VBMG）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能从音乐中想象出场景，现有音乐描述模型仅关注音乐元素，缺乏跨模态能力。

Method: 构建大规模视频-音频描述数据集，微调Music Understanding LLaMA（MU-LLaMA）为MusiScene模型。

Result: MusiScene生成的场景描述比MU-LLaMA更相关，且能提升VBMG任务。

Conclusion: MusiScene通过跨模态训练实现了音乐场景想象，为音乐与视频的结合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Humans can imagine various atmospheres and settings when listening to music,
envisioning movie scenes that complement each piece. For example, slow,
melancholic music might evoke scenes of heartbreak, while upbeat melodies
suggest celebration. This paper explores whether a Music Language Model, e.g.
MU-LLaMA, can perform a similar task, called Music Scene Imagination (MSI),
which requires cross-modal information from video and music to train. To
improve upon existing music captioning models which focusing solely on musical
elements, we introduce MusiScene, a music captioning model designed to imagine
scenes that complement each music. In this paper, (1) we construct a
large-scale video-audio caption dataset with 3,371 pairs, (2) we finetune Music
Understanding LLaMA for the MSI task to create MusiScene, and (3) we conduct
comprehensive evaluations and prove that our MusiScene is more capable of
generating contextually relevant captions compared to MU-LLaMA. We leverage the
generated MSI captions to enhance Video Background Music Generation (VBMG) from
text.

TL;DR: BlueLM-2.5-3B是一个紧凑的多模态大语言模型，支持思考和普通模式，适用于边缘设备，性能优越且数据高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个高效、适用于边缘设备的多模态大语言模型，同时具备强大的通用和推理能力。

Method: 通过多样化数据整理、关键数据重采样、混合异构强化学习和高性能训练基础设施开发模型。

Result: 在文本和多模态基准测试中表现优异，数据效率高，性能接近或超过更大模型。

Conclusion: BlueLM-2.5-3B为高性能边缘设备MLLM的发展提供了重要贡献和研究启示。

Abstract: We present BlueLM-2.5-3B, a compact and unified dense Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) designed for efficient edge-device deployment, offering
strong general-purpose and reasoning capabilities. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first 3B-scale MLLM to support both thinking and
non-thinking modes, while also enabling explicit control over thinking token
budget. BlueLM-2.5-3B is developed through diversified data curation, key data
resampling, hybrid heterogeneous reinforcement learning, and a high-performance
training infrastructure. Our model achieves superior multimodal capacity while
preserving competitive pure-text performance with only 2.9 billion parameters.
We conduct comprehensive evaluations across a broad range of multimodal and
text-only benchmarks. In thinking mode, BlueLM-2.5-3B achieves comparable
performance to Qwen3-4B on text-only benchmarks, and trails the larger
Kimi-VL-A3B-16B by only about 5% on average across multimodal evaluations. In
non-thinking mode, it outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-3B on the majority of multimodal
benchmarks. Additionally, BlueLM-2.5-3B exhibits exceptional data efficiency.
All of the aforementioned performance is achieved with substantially less total
training data than Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen3-4B. We hope our work contributes to
the advancement of high-performance, on-device MLLMs and provides meaningful
insights to the research community.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于无线网络中多任务预测的统一基础模型，支持不同预测区间，并通过分解、粒度编码和因果Transformer实现高泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着移动通信网络的复杂性和动态性增加，准确预测关键系统参数（如CSI、用户位置和网络流量）对PHY层和MAC层任务至关重要。传统深度学习方法难以泛化到不同场景和任务。

Method: 提出统一基础模型，通过单变量分解统一异构任务，编码粒度以实现区间感知，使用因果Transformer进行预测，并引入补丁掩码策略支持任意输入长度。

Result: 在大规模数据集上训练后，模型在未见场景中表现出强泛化能力，并在新任务上实现零样本性能，超越传统全样本基线。

Conclusion: 该基础模型为无线网络中的多任务预测提供了一种高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing complexity and dynamics of the mobile communication
networks, accurately predicting key system parameters, such as channel state
information (CSI), user location, and network traffic, has become essential for
a wide range of physical (PHY)-layer and medium access control (MAC)-layer
tasks. Although traditional deep learning (DL)-based methods have been widely
applied to such prediction tasks, they often struggle to generalize across
different scenarios and tasks. In response, we propose a unified foundation
model for multi-task prediction in wireless networks that supports diverse
prediction intervals. The proposed model enforces univariate decomposition to
unify heterogeneous tasks, encodes granularity for interval awareness, and uses
a causal Transformer backbone for accurate predictions. Additionally, we
introduce a patch masking strategy during training to support arbitrary input
lengths. After trained on large-scale datasets, the proposed foundation model
demonstrates strong generalization to unseen scenarios and achieves zero-shot
performance on new tasks that surpass traditional full-shot baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于属性的方法，通过信息检索技术分析规则预测模型中的属性，提高可解释AI在乳腺癌淋巴水肿风险评估中的透明度和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动的AI技术在医疗决策中缺乏透明性，限制了其可解释性和接受度，尤其是在乳腺癌淋巴水肿风险评估中。

Method: 采用基于属性的方法，利用信息检索技术对规则预测模型中的属性进行统计分析，计算每个属性对预测的相关性。

Result: 用户研究表明，与原始可解释AI模型相比，该方法生成的输出具有更高的可解释性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了可解释AI在医疗风险评估中的透明度和用户接受度。

Abstract: The lack of transparency of data-driven Artificial Intelligence techniques
limits their interpretability and acceptance into healthcare decision-making
processes. We propose an attribution-based approach to improve the
interpretability of Explainable AI-based predictions in the specific context of
arm lymphedema's risk assessment after lymph nodal radiotherapy in breast
cancer. The proposed method performs a statistical analysis of the attributes
in the rule-based prediction model using standard metrics from Information
Retrieval techniques. This analysis computes the relevance of each attribute to
the prediction and provides users with interpretable information about the
impact of risk factors. The results of a user study that compared the output
generated by the proposed approach with the raw output of the Explainable AI
model suggested higher levels of interpretability and usefulness in the context
of predicting lymphedema risk.

TL;DR: HopeBot是一种基于大型语言模型的聊天机器人，用于抑郁症筛查，与传统PHQ-9问卷相比，用户反馈更信任且体验更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PHQ-9问卷缺乏互动性和适应性，HopeBot旨在提供更灵活、支持性更强的筛查工具。

Method: 开发HopeBot，采用检索增强生成和实时澄清技术，进行PHQ-9问卷的交互式管理，并在132名成人中进行对比研究。

Result: HopeBot与自填问卷得分高度一致（ICC=0.91），71%用户更信任聊天机器人，87.1%愿意重复使用或推荐。

Conclusion: 语音交互的LLM聊天机器人可作为抑郁症筛查的可扩展、低负担辅助工具。

Abstract: Static tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) effectively
screen depression but lack interactivity and adaptability. We developed
HopeBot, a chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM) that administers the
PHQ-9 using retrieval-augmented generation and real-time clarification. In a
within-subject study, 132 adults in the United Kingdom and China completed both
self-administered and chatbot versions. Scores demonstrated strong agreement
(ICC = 0.91; 45% identical). Among 75 participants providing comparative
feedback, 71% reported greater trust in the chatbot, highlighting clearer
structure, interpretive guidance, and a supportive tone. Mean ratings (0-10)
were 8.4 for comfort, 7.7 for voice clarity, 7.6 for handling sensitive topics,
and 7.4 for recommendation helpfulness; the latter varied significantly by
employment status and prior mental-health service use (p < 0.05). Overall,
87.1% expressed willingness to reuse or recommend HopeBot. These findings
demonstrate voice-based LLM chatbots can feasibly serve as scalable, low-burden
adjuncts for routine depression screening.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CogniSQL-R1-Zero是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过轻量级奖励信号（执行正确性和格式合规性）生成准确的SQL，在Text2SQL基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言转SQL（Text-to-SQL）中复杂查询生成的挑战，避免中间监督和复杂奖励设计。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，仅依赖执行正确性和格式合规性作为奖励信号，简化训练流程。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中超越现有监督和指令调优基线模型，如SFT CodeS-7B等，且训练资源需求低。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了强化学习在Text-to-SQL任务中的高效性和可扩展性，并发布了两个数据集以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL) remains a core challenge
at the intersection of language understanding and structured data access.
Although large language models (LLMs) have improved fluency, generating correct
and executable SQL, especially for complex queries, continues to be
challenging. We introduce CogniSQL-R1-Zero, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework and model that produces accurate SQL using a lightweight reward
signal based on execution correctness and format-tag compliance. By avoiding
intermediate supervision, hybrid pipelines and complex reward shaping, our
method encourages stable learning and stronger alignment with the ultimate task
objective-producing executable programs. CogniSQL-R1-Zero achieves
state-of-the-art execution accuracy on Text2SQL benchmark; BIRD bench,
outperforming prior supervised and instruction-tuned baselines including SFT
CodeS-7B, DeepSeek-Coder 236B, and Mistral 123B-despite being trained on a
significantly smaller 7B backbone. This result underscores the scalability and
efficiency of our RL-based approach when trained on just four NVIDIA A100 GPUs
(40 GB VRAM each). To support further research in efficient and interpretable
Text-to-SQL modeling, we release two curated datasets: (i) a collection of
5,024 reasoning traces with varying context lengths, and (ii) a
positive-sampled corpus of 36,356 corpus of weakly supervised queries, each
annotated with six semantically diverse reasoning paths. Together, these
contributions advance scalable, execution-aligned Text-to-SQL generation.

Motivation: 解决XAI方法在非专家用户中生成清晰解释的困难。

Method: 提出Feature-Guided Neighbor Selection (FGNS)，结合局部和全局特征重要性选择样本。

Result: 在Kannada脚本分类实验中，FGNS显著提升非专家识别模型错误的能力，决策更快更准。

Conclusion: FGNS是迈向更人性化模型评估的一步，但需进一步缩小解释质量与用户信任间的差距。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods often struggle to generate clear, interpretable
outputs for users without domain expertise. We introduce Feature-Guided
Neighbor Selection (FGNS), a post hoc method that enhances interpretability by
selecting class-representative examples using both local and global feature
importance. In a user study (N = 98) evaluating Kannada script classifications,
FGNS significantly improved non-experts' ability to identify model errors while
maintaining appropriate agreement with correct predictions. Participants made
faster and more accurate decisions compared to those given traditional k-NN
explanations. Quantitative analysis shows that FGNS selects neighbors that
better reflect class characteristics rather than merely minimizing
feature-space distance, leading to more consistent selection and tighter
clustering around class prototypes. These results support FGNS as a step toward
more human-aligned model assessment, although further work is needed to address
the gap between explanation quality and perceived trust.

Motivation: Lockean信念集合在经典逻辑演绎下通常不封闭，这限制了其在信念修正理论等领域的应用。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了两种使信念集合在经典逻辑演绎下封闭的特征化方法，并设计了一种最小化修正的信念更新方法。

Result: 展示了如何通过最小修正实现信念集合的演绎封闭性。

Conclusion: 本文的方法为Lockean信念集合的封闭性和最小修正提供了理论支持，扩展了其应用范围。

Abstract: Within the formal setting of the Lockean thesis, an agent belief set is
defined in terms of degrees of confidence and these are described in
probabilistic terms. This approach is of established interest, notwithstanding
some limitations that make its use troublesome in some contexts, like, for
instance, in belief change theory. Precisely, Lockean belief sets are not
generally closed under (classical) logical deduction. The aim of the present
paper is twofold: on one side we provide two characterizations of those belief
sets that are closed under classical logic deduction, and on the other we
propose an approach to probabilistic update that allows us for a minimal
revision of those beliefs, i.e., a revision obtained by making the fewest
possible changes to the existing belief set while still accommodating the new
information. In particular, we show how we can deductively close a belief set
via a minimal revision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在金融领域的应用研究有限，需结合领域知识和结构化推理能力。

Method: FEVO框架采用持续预训练（CPT）、监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）三阶段方法，结合高质量数据集FEVO-Train。

Result: FEVO-R32B在五个金融基准测试中表现最优，验证了领域知识扩展和结构化推理的有效性。

Conclusion: FEVO框架显著提升了LLM在金融领域的性能，为领域专用LLM的发展提供了有效路径。

Abstract: Advancements in reasoning for large language models (LLMs) have lead to
significant performance improvements for LLMs in various fields such as
mathematics and programming. However, research applying these advances to the
financial domain, where considerable domain-specific knowledge is necessary to
complete tasks, remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce FEVO
(Financial Evolution), a multi-stage enhancement framework developed to enhance
LLM performance in the financial domain. FEVO systemically enhances LLM
performance by using continued pre-training (CPT) to expand financial domain
knowledge, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill structured, elaborate
reasoning patterns, and reinforcement learning (RL) to further integrate the
expanded financial domain knowledge with the learned structured reasoning. To
ensure effective and efficient training, we leverage frontier reasoning models
and rule-based filtering to curate FEVO-Train, high-quality datasets
specifically designed for the different post-training phases. Using our
framework, we train the FEVO series of models -- C32B, S32B, R32B -- from
Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate them on seven benchmarks to assess financial and
general capabilities, with results showing that FEVO-R32B achieves
state-of-the-art performance on five financial benchmarks against much larger
models as well as specialist models. More significantly, FEVO-R32B demonstrates
markedly better performance than FEVO-R32B-0 (trained from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct
using only RL), thus validating the effectiveness of financial domain knowledge
expansion and structured, logical reasoning distillation

Motivation: 医疗设施的能源需求波动大，传统方法效率低且成本高，亟需更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用LSTM进行时间序列预测，结合遗传算法优化参数和负载平衡策略，并通过SHAP增强模型可解释性。

Result: LSTM在预测性能上显著优于ARIMA和Prophet模型（MAE和RMSE更低），遗传算法优化了实时响应能力，SHAP提高了决策透明度。

Conclusion: 该研究为医疗设施能源管理提供了高效、可扩展的AI解决方案，未来可探索实时部署和强化学习结合。

Abstract: This paper tackles the urgent need for efficient energy management in
healthcare facilities, where fluctuating demands challenge operational
efficiency and sustainability. Traditional methods often prove inadequate,
causing inefficiencies and higher costs. To address this, the study presents an
AI-based framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), genetic algorithm
(GA), and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), specifically designed for
healthcare energy management. Although LSTM is widely used for time-series
forecasting, its application in healthcare energy prediction remains
underexplored. The results reveal that LSTM significantly outperforms ARIMA and
Prophet models in forecasting complex, non-linear demand patterns. LSTM
achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.69 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
of 29.96, far better than Prophet (MAE: 59.78, RMSE: 81.22) and ARIMA (MAE:
87.73, RMSE: 125.22), demonstrating superior performance. The genetic algorithm
is applied to optimize model parameters and improve load balancing strategies,
enabling adaptive responses to real-time energy fluctuations. SHAP analysis
further enhances model transparency by explaining the influence of different
features on predictions, fostering trust in decision-making processes. This
integrated LSTM-GA-SHAP approach offers a robust solution for improving
forecasting accuracy, boosting energy efficiency, and advancing sustainability
in healthcare facilities. Future research may explore real-time deployment and
hybridization with reinforcement learning for continuous optimization. Overall,
the study establishes a solid foundation for using AI in healthcare energy
management, highlighting its scalability, efficiency, and resilience potential.

TL;DR: OpenAgentSafety是一个模块化框架，用于评估AI代理在真实工具环境中的安全性，覆盖八类关键风险，并支持多任务和多用户场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法依赖模拟环境或狭窄任务域，无法全面评估AI代理在真实工具中的安全行为。

Method: OpenAgentSafety结合规则分析和LLM评估，支持真实工具交互和多任务测试。

Result: 在五种LLM测试中，不安全行为占比51.2%至72.7%，显示现有代理存在显著安全隐患。

Conclusion: OpenAgentSafety为AI代理安全性评估提供了全面框架，强调需加强安全保障措施。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI agents capable of solving complex, everyday tasks, from
scheduling to customer service, have enabled deployment in real-world settings,
but their possibilities for unsafe behavior demands rigorous evaluation. While
prior benchmarks have attempted to assess agent safety, most fall short by
relying on simulated environments, narrow task domains, or unrealistic tool
abstractions. We introduce OpenAgentSafety, a comprehensive and modular
framework for evaluating agent behavior across eight critical risk categories.
Unlike prior work, our framework evaluates agents that interact with real
tools, including web browsers, code execution environments, file systems, bash
shells, and messaging platforms; and supports over 350 multi-turn, multi-user
tasks spanning both benign and adversarial user intents. OpenAgentSafety is
designed for extensibility, allowing researchers to add tools, tasks, websites,
and adversarial strategies with minimal effort. It combines rule-based analysis
with LLM-as-judge assessments to detect both overt and subtle unsafe behaviors.
Empirical analysis of five prominent LLMs in agentic scenarios reveals unsafe
behavior in 51.2% of safety-vulnerable tasks with Claude-Sonnet-3.7, to 72.7%
with o3-mini, highlighting critical safety vulnerabilities and the need for
stronger safeguards before real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过配对偏好数据（即使数据点本身较弱）提升语言模型性能的方法，称为“delta学习”，并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决强监督数据稀缺时如何提升语言模型性能的问题。

Method: 通过配对弱数据点（如小模型的输出）生成偏好数据，利用相对质量差异（delta）进行偏好调优。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在11个基准测试中匹配了当前最优的开源模型性能，且成本更低。

Conclusion: delta学习为语言模型提供了一种简单、低成本的高效训练方法，即使数据点本身较弱。

Abstract: Improvements in language models are often driven by improving the quality of
the data we train them on, which can be limiting when strong supervision is
scarce. In this work, we show that paired preference data consisting of
individually weak data points can enable gains beyond the strength of each
individual data point. We formulate the delta learning hypothesis to explain
this phenomenon, positing that the relative quality delta between points
suffices to drive learning via preference tuning--even when supervised
finetuning on the weak data hurts. We validate our hypothesis in controlled
experiments and at scale, where we post-train 8B models on preference data
generated by pairing a small 3B model's responses with outputs from an even
smaller 1.5B model to create a meaningful delta. Strikingly, on a standard
11-benchmark evaluation suite (MATH, MMLU, etc.), our simple recipe matches the
performance of Tulu 3, a state-of-the-art open model tuned from the same base
model while relying on much stronger supervisors (e.g., GPT-4o). Thus, delta
learning enables simpler and cheaper open recipes for state-of-the-art
post-training. To better understand delta learning, we prove in logistic
regression that the performance gap between two weak teacher models provides
useful signal for improving a stronger student. Overall, our work shows that
models can learn surprisingly well from paired data that might typically be
considered weak.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂或高维环境中，完全指定的因果图通常未知，限制了因果效应的识别。通过因果抽象简化表示，可以部分保留因果信息，从而克服这一限制。

Method: 提出并形式化了因果抽象框架下的多个可识别性标准，并将这些标准组织成一个结构化层次，展示其关系。

Result: 通过层次化的可识别性标准，明确了在不同因果知识水平下可识别的因果查询，并提供了工具来推理缺乏完整因果知识时的可识别性。

Conclusion: 因果抽象的层次化框架为在部分因果信息下识别因果效应提供了清晰的理论基础和实践工具。

Abstract: Identifying the effect of a treatment from observational data typically
requires assuming a fully specified causal diagram. However, such diagrams are
rarely known in practice, especially in complex or high-dimensional settings.
To overcome this limitation, recent works have explored the use of causal
abstractions-simplified representations that retain partial causal information.
In this paper, we consider causal abstractions formalized as collections of
causal diagrams, and focus on the identifiability of causal queries within such
collections. We introduce and formalize several identifiability criteria under
this setting. Our main contribution is to organize these criteria into a
structured hierarchy, highlighting their relationships. This hierarchical view
enables a clearer understanding of what can be identified under varying levels
of causal knowledge. We illustrate our framework through examples from the
literature and provide tools to reason about identifiability when full causal
knowledge is unavailable.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种对齐评分规则（ASR），通过优化均方误差来使评分规则更符合人类偏好，同时保持其正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评分规则虽能保证正确性，但未必符合人类对文本的偏好。

Method: 设计ASR，通过最小化评分规则与参考评分（如人类评分）的均方误差。

Result: 实验表明ASR在保持正确性的同时，更符合人类偏好。

Conclusion: ASR是一种有效的文本评分规则，兼顾正确性与人类偏好。

Abstract: Scoring rules elicit probabilistic predictions from a strategic agent by
scoring the prediction against a ground truth state. A scoring rule is proper
if, from the agent's perspective, reporting the true belief maximizes the
expected score. With the development of language models, Wu and Hartline (2024)
proposes a reduction from textual information elicitation to the numerical
(i.e. probabilistic) information elicitation problem, which achieves provable
properness for textual elicitation. However, not all proper scoring rules are
well aligned with human preference over text. Our paper designs the Aligned
Scoring rule (ASR) for text by optimizing and minimizing the mean squared error
between a proper scoring rule and a reference score (e.g. human score). Our
experiments show that our ASR outperforms previous methods in aligning with
human preference while maintaining properness.
