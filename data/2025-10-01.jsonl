Unlike conventional interfaces that rely on panels or handheld\ndevices, the woven tactile skin integrates seamlessly with curved robot\nsurfaces, enabling embodied interaction and narrowing the gap between human\nintent and robot response. Its woven design combines fabric-like flexibility\nwith structural stability and dense multi-channel sensing through the\ninterlaced conductive threads. Building on this capability, we define a\ngesture-action mapping of 14 single- and multi-touch gestures that cover\nrepresentative robot commands, including task-space motion and auxiliary\nfunctions. A lightweight convolution-transformer model designed for gesture\nrecognition in real time achieves an accuracy of near-100%, outperforming prior\nbaseline approaches. Experiments on robot arm tasks, including pick-and-place\nand pouring, demonstrate that our system reduces task completion time by up to\n57% compared with keyboard panels and teach pendants. Overall, our proposed\nframework demonstrates a practical pathway toward more natural and efficient\nembodied HRI."}

Recent approaches advocate for co-design,\noptimizing both design and control in parallel to maximize robotic\ncapabilities. This paper presents the Evolutionary Continuous Adaptive RL-based\nCo-Design (EA-CoRL) framework, which combines reinforcement learning (RL) with\nevolutionary strategies to enable continuous adaptation of the control policy\nto the hardware. EA-CoRL comprises two key components: Design Evolution, which\nexplores the hardware choices using an evolutionary algorithm to identify\nefficient configurations, and Policy Continuous Adaptation, which fine-tunes a\ntask-specific control policy across evolving designs to maximize performance\nrewards. We evaluate EA-CoRL by co-designing the actuators (gear ratios) and\ncontrol policy of the RH5 humanoid for a highly dynamic chin-up task,\npreviously unfeasible due to actuator limitations.

In these scenarios,\nconsistent identification of obstacles and terrain features can be difficult\ndue to noise and algorithmic shortcomings, which can make it difficult for\nmotion planning systems to generate safe motions. One particular difficulty to\novercome is when regions of the cost map switch between being marked as\nobstacles and free space through successive planning cycles. One potential\nsolution to this, which we refer to as Valid in Every Hypothesis (VEH), is for\nthe planning system to plan motions that are guaranteed to be safe through a\nhistory of world models. Another approach is to track a history of world\nmodels, and adjust node costs according to the potential penalty of needing to\nreroute around previously hazardous areas. This work discusses three major\niterations on this idea. The first iteration, called PEH, invokes a sub-search\nfor every node expansion that crosses through a divergence point in the world\nmodels. The second and third iterations, called GEH and GEGRH respectively,\ndefer the sub-search until after an edge expands into the goal region. GEGRH\nuses an additional step to revise the graph based on divergent nodes in each\nworld. Initial results showed that, although PEH and GEH find more optimistic\nsolutions than VEH, they are unable to generate solutions in less than\none-second, which exceeds our requirements for field deployment.

These methods rely on image-based\nrepresentations of target shapes to compute local density gradients and perform\nmean-shift exploration, which constitute their core mechanism. However, such\nimage representations incur substantial memory overhead, which can become\nprohibitive for high-resolution or 3D shapes. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose a memory-efficient tree map representation that hierarchically encodes\nuser-specified shapes and is applicable to both 2D and 3D scenarios. Building\non this representation, we design a behavior-based distributed controller that\nenables assignment-free shape assembly. Comparative 2D and 3D simulations\nagainst a state-of-the-art mean-shift algorithm demonstrate one to two orders\nof magnitude lower memory usage and two to three times faster shape entry while\nmaintaining comparable uniformity.

This work proposes a\nmulti-robot UGV-UAV localization system that leverages the two technologies\nwith inexpensive and readily-available sensors, such as Inertial Measurement\nUnits (IMUs) and wheel encoders, to estimate the relative position of an aerial\nrobot with respect to a ground robot. The first stage of the system pipeline\nincludes a nonlinear optimization framework to trilaterate the location of the\naerial platform based on UWB range data, and a radar pre-processing module with\nloosely coupled ego-motion estimation which has been adapted for a multi-robot\nscenario. Then, the pre-processed radar data as well as the relative\ntransformation are fed to a pose-graph optimization framework with odometry and\ninter-robot constraints. The system, implemented for the Robotic Operating\nSystem (ROS 2) with the Ceres optimizer, has been validated in\nSoftware-in-the-Loop (SITL) simulations and in a real-world dataset. The\nproposed relative localization module outperforms state-of-the-art closed-form\nmethods which are less robust to noise. Our SITL environment includes a custom\nGazebo plugin for generating realistic UWB measurements modeled after real\ndata. Conveniently, the proposed factor graph formulation makes the system\nreadily extensible to full Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM).\nFinally, all the code and experimental data is publicly available to support\nreproducibility and to serve as a common open dataset for benchmarking."}

However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the\nsignificant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically\nimplausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly,\ncommon retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment\ninteractions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To\naddress this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data\ngeneration engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and\npreserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the\nterrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation\nbetween the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints,\nOmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover,\npreserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from\na single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object\nconfigurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions\nfrom OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour\ntrajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact\npreservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables\nproprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30\nseconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained\nwith only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks,\nwithout any learning curriculum."}

Most VLA models focus on interpreting vision\nand language to generate actions, whereas robots must perceive and interact\nwithin the spatial-physical world. This gap highlights the need for a\ncomprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information, which\nis crucial for achieving complex and contact-rich control. To this end, we\nintroduce a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that collaboratively\nperceives heterogeneous sensory modalities and predicts future multisensory\nobjectives to facilitate physical world modeling. Specifically, to enhance\nperceptual representations, we propose an encoder-free multimodal alignment\nscheme that innovatively repurposes the large language model itself as a\nperception module, directly interpreting multimodal cues by aligning 2D images,\n3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence. To\nfurther enhance MLA's understanding of physical dynamics, we design a future\nmultisensory generation post-training strategy that enables MLA to reason about\nsemantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing more robust\nconditions for action generation. For evaluation, the MLA model outperforms the\nprevious state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex,\ncontact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, while also demonstrating improved\ngeneralization to unseen configurations.
