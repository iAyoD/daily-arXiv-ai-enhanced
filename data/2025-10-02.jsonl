However, most existing Vision-Language-Action\nmodels (VLAs) have been designed without considering this aspect, i.e., they\nrely solely on the current observation, ignoring preceding context. In this\npaper, we propose HAMLET, a scalable framework to adapt VLAs to attend to the\nhistorical context during action prediction. Specifically, we introduce moment\ntokens that compactly encode perceptual information at each timestep. Their\nrepresentations are initialized with time-contrastive learning, allowing them\nto better capture temporally distinctive aspects. Next, we employ a lightweight\nmemory module that integrates the moment tokens across past timesteps into\nmemory features, which are then leveraged for action prediction. Through\nempirical evaluation, we show that HAMLET successfully transforms a\nstate-of-the-art VLA into a history-aware policy, especially demonstrating\nsignificant improvements on long-horizon tasks that require historical context.\nIn particular, on top of GR00T N1.5, HAMLET achieves an average success rate of\n76.4% on history-dependent real-world tasks, surpassing the baseline\nperformance by 47.2%. Furthermore, HAMLET pushes prior art performance from\n64.1% to 66.4% on RoboCasa Kitchen (100-demo setup) and from 95.6% to 97.7% on\nLIBERO, highlighting its effectiveness even under generic robot-manipulation\nbenchmarks."}

We propose a Cross-State Transition Attention Transformer that\nemploys a novel State Transition Attention (STA) mechanism to modulate standard\nattention weights based on learned state evolution patterns, enabling policies\nto better adapt their behavior based on execution history.

To address these issues, this paper proposes the first Random-to-Target\nFabric Flattening (RTFF) policy, which aligns a random wrinkled fabric state to\nan arbitrary wrinkle-free target state. The proposed policy adopts a hybrid\nImitation Learning-Visual Servoing (IL-VS) framework, where IL learns with\nexplicit fabric models for coarse alignment of the wrinkled fabric toward a\nwrinkle-free state near the target, and VS ensures fine alignment to the\ntarget. Central to this framework is a template-based mesh that offers precise\ntarget state representation, wrinkle-aware geometry prediction, and consistent\nvertex correspondence across RTFF manipulation steps, enabling robust\nmanipulation and seamless IL-VS switching. Leveraging the power of mesh, a\nnovel IL solution for RTFF-Mesh Action Chunking Transformer (MACT)-is then\nproposed by conditioning the mesh information into a Transformer-based policy.\nThe RTFF policy is validated on a real dual-arm tele-operation system, showing\nzero-shot alignment to different targets, high accuracy, and strong\ngeneralization across fabrics and scales.

Yet their advancement is constrained by the high cost of\nacquiring large-scale interaction datasets. This work introduces an alternative\nparadigm for enhancing policy performance without additional model training.\nPerhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that the composed policies can exceed the\nperformance of either parent policy. Our contribution is threefold. First, we\nestablish a theoretical foundation showing that the convex composition of\ndistributional scores from multiple diffusion models can yield a superior\none-step functional objective compared to any individual score. A\nGr\\\"onwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement\npropagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic\nperformance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General\nPolicy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by\ncombining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a\nconvex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the\nplug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA\nmodels, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of\ntheir input visual modalities. Third, we provide extensive empirical\nvalidation. Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks, alongside\nreal-world robotic evaluations, confirm that GPC consistently improves\nperformance and adaptability across a diverse set of tasks.
