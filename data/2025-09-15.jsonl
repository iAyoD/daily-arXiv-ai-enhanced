In-context learning (ICL) is a promising framework\nfor achieving this goal due to its test-time data efficiency and rapid\nadaptability. However, current ICL methods rely on labor-intensive teleoperated\ndata for training, which restricts scalability. We propose using human play\nvideos -- continuous, unlabeled videos of people interacting freely with their\nenvironment -- as a scalable and diverse training data source. We introduce\nMimicDroid, which enables humanoids to perform ICL using human play videos as\nthe only training data. MimicDroid extracts trajectory pairs with similar\nmanipulation behaviors and trains the policy to predict the actions of one\ntrajectory conditioned on the other. Through this process, the model acquired\nICL capabilities for adapting to novel objects and environments at test time.\nTo bridge the embodiment gap, MimicDroid first retargets human wrist poses\nestimated from RGB videos to the humanoid, leveraging kinematic similarity. It\nalso applies random patch masking during training to reduce overfitting to\nhuman-specific cues and improve robustness to visual differences. To evaluate\nfew-shot learning for humanoids, we introduce an open-source simulation\nbenchmark with increasing levels of generalization difficulty.

This study proposes\nSelf-Augmented Robot Trajectory (SART), a framework that enables policy\nlearning from a single human demonstration, while safely expanding the dataset\nthrough autonomous augmentation. SART consists of two stages: (1) human\nteaching only once, where a single demonstration is provided and precision\nboundaries -- represented as spheres around key waypoints -- are annotated,\nfollowed by one environment reset; (2) robot self-augmentation, where the robot\ngenerates diverse, collision-free trajectories within these boundaries and\nreconnects to the original demonstration.

However, as a wearable device, the generated moment from its\noperation acts on the human body as an external torque. When the moments\nincrease, more muscle units are activated for balancing, and it can result in\nreduced muscular null space. Therefore, this paper suggests a concept of a\nmotion planning layer that reduces the generated moment for enhanced\nHuman-Robot Interaction. It modifies given trajectories with desirable angular\nacceleration and position deviation limits. Its performance to reduce the\nmoment is demonstrated through the simulation, which uses simplified human and\nrobotic system models."}

Project page: [this https\n  URL](https://bagh2178.github.io/GC-VLN/)", "summary": "In this paper, we propose a training-free framework for vision-and-language\nnavigation (VLN). Existing zero-shot VLN methods are mainly designed for\ndiscrete environments or involve unsupervised training in continuous simulator\nenvironments, which makes it challenging to generalize and deploy them in\nreal-world scenarios. To achieve a training-free framework in continuous\nenvironments, our framework formulates navigation guidance as graph constraint\noptimization by decomposing instructions into explicit spatial constraints. The\nconstraint-driven paradigm decodes spatial semantics through constraint\nsolving, enabling zero-shot adaptation to unseen environments. Specifically, we\nconstruct a spatial constraint library covering all types of spatial\nrelationship mentioned in VLN instructions. The human instruction is decomposed\ninto a directed acyclic graph, with waypoint nodes, object nodes and edges,\nwhich are used as queries to retrieve the library to build the graph\nconstraints. The graph constraint optimization is solved by the constraint\nsolver to determine the positions of waypoints, obtaining the robot's\nnavigation path and final goal. To handle cases of no solution or multiple\nsolutions, we construct a navigation tree and the backtracking mechanism.\nExtensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate significant\nimprovements in success rate and navigation efficiency compared to\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot VLN methods. We further conduct real-world\nexperiments to show that our framework can effectively generalize to new\nenvironments and instruction sets, paving the way for a more robust and\nautonomous navigation framework."}
