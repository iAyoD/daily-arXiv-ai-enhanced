### [1] [Towards High-Precision Depth Sensing via Monocular-Aided iToF and RGB Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16579)
*Yansong Du,Yutong Deng,Yuting Zhou,Feiyu Jiao,Jian Song,Xun Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的iToF-RGB融合框架，通过准确的几何标定和双编码器融合网络，解决iToF深度感知的分辨率低、视场角小和结构扭曲问题，实现了更高准确度的深度感知和无缝视场扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决间接时间飞行法(iToF)深度感知的内在限制，包括低空间分辨率、有限的视场角(FoV)以及复杂场景中的结构扭曲问题。

Method: 首先通过精确的几何标定和对齐模块，将窄FoV iToF深度图重新投影到宽FoV RGB坐标系统；然后使用双编码器融合网络联合提取重新投影iToF深度和RGB图像的互补特征，以单目深度先验知识为指导恢复细粒度结构细节并进行深度超分辨率。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，该框架在准确性、结构一致性和视觉质量方面显著超过了现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过集成跨模态结构线索和深度一致性约束，该方法实现了提升的深度准确性、改善的边缘锐利度和无缝的视场角扩展，为iToF深度感知提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel iToF-RGB fusion framework designed to address the
inherent limitations of indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) depth sensing, such as
low spatial resolution, limited field-of-view (FoV), and structural distortion
in complex scenes. The proposed method first reprojects the narrow-FoV iToF
depth map onto the wide-FoV RGB coordinate system through a precise geometric
calibration and alignment module, ensuring pixel-level correspondence between
modalities. A dual-encoder fusion network is then employed to jointly extract
complementary features from the reprojected iToF depth and RGB image, guided by
monocular depth priors to recover fine-grained structural details and perform
depth super-resolution. By integrating cross-modal structural cues and depth
consistency constraints, our approach achieves enhanced depth accuracy,
improved edge sharpness, and seamless FoV expansion. Extensive experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy,
structural consistency, and visual quality.

### [2] [CountLoop: Training-Free High-Instance Image Generation via Iterative Agent Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16644)
*Anindya Mondal,Ayan Banerjee,Sauradip Nag,Josep Lladós,Xiatian Zhu,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountLoop是一个无需训练的框架，通过迭代结构化反馈为扩散模型提供精确的实例控制，在复杂高密度场景中实现高达98%的计数准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在逼真图像合成方面表现出色，但在生成具有精确对象实例数量的场景时不可靠，特别是在复杂高密度设置中

Method: 采用图像生成和多模态代理评估交替的方法，包括语言引导的规划器和评论器评估对象计数、空间布局和属性一致性，并引入实例驱动的注意力掩码和组合生成技术

Result: 在COCO Count、T2I CompBench和两个新高实例基准测试中，CountLoop达到98%的计数准确率，保持空间保真度和视觉质量，得分0.97

Conclusion: CountLoop通过迭代结构化反馈有效解决了扩散模型在精确实例控制方面的局限性，显著提升了复杂场景中的对象计数准确性

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in photorealistic image
synthesis, yet they remain unreliable for generating scenes with a precise
number of object instances, particularly in complex and high-density settings.
We present CountLoop, a training-free framework that provides diffusion models
with accurate instance control through iterative structured feedback. The
approach alternates between image generation and multimodal agent evaluation,
where a language-guided planner and critic assess object counts, spatial
arrangements, and attribute consistency. This feedback is then used to refine
layouts and guide subsequent generations. To further improve separation between
objects, especially in occluded scenes, we introduce instance-driven attention
masking and compositional generation techniques. Experiments on COCO Count, T2I
CompBench, and two new high-instance benchmarks show that CountLoop achieves
counting accuracy of up to 98% while maintaining spatial fidelity and visual
quality, outperforming layout-based and gradient-guided baselines with a score
of 0.97.

### [3] [Do VLMs Have Bad Eyes? Diagnosing Compositional Failures via Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16652)
*Ashwath Vaithinathan Aravindan,Abha Jha,Mihir Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究通过机制可解释性技术分析发现，CLIP视觉编码器中MLP层的神经元存在特征叠加现象，这直接阻碍了组合特征表示能力，导致视觉语言模型在组合泛化和对象绑定方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在图像描述和视觉问答等任务中表现出色，但在组合泛化和对象绑定方面存在明显不足，限制了其处理新颖对象属性组合的能力。本研究旨在探索这些失败的根本原因。

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术分析CLIP视觉编码器的MLP层，研究神经元特征表示的特性。

Result: 发现CLIP视觉编码器MLP层中的单个神经元同时表示多个特征，这种"叠加"现象直接阻碍了组合特征表示能力，从而影响了组合推理和对象绑定能力。

Conclusion: 这项研究为揭示视觉语言模型中组合失败问题的机制根源迈出了第一步，相关代码和结果已在GitHub上公开。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
integrating visual and textual information for tasks such as image captioning
and visual question answering. However, these models struggle with
compositional generalization and object binding, which limit their ability to
handle novel combinations of objects and their attributes. Our work explores
the root causes of these failures using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. We show evidence that individual neurons in the MLP layers of
CLIP's vision encoder represent multiple features, and this "superposition"
directly hinders its compositional feature representation which consequently
affects compositional reasoning and object binding capabilities. We hope this
study will serve as an initial step toward uncovering the mechanistic roots of
compositional failures in VLMs. The code and supporting results can be found

### [4] [MSNav: Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation with Dynamic Memory and LLM Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16654)
*Chenghao Liu,Zhimu Zhou,Jiachen Zhang,Minghao Zhang,Songfang Huang,Huiling Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSNav框架通过集成记忆模块、空间模块和决策模块，解决了VLN任务中的空间推理弱、跨模态对齐差和长时记忆过载问题，在R2R和REVERIE数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于单一LLM的端到端VLN方法存在空间推理能力弱、跨模态对齐差、长时任务记忆过载等关键缺陷，需要系统性地解决这些问题。

Method: 提出MSNav框架，包含三个协同模块：1）记忆模块-动态地图记忆，通过选择性节点剪枝处理记忆过载；2）空间模块-空间推理和物体关系推断，基于新构建的I-O-S数据集微调Qwen3-4B得到Qwen-Sp模型；3）决策模块-基于LLM的路径规划执行稳健动作。

Result: 在I-O-S测试集上，Qwen-Sp在物体列表提取方面超越领先商业LLM，获得更高的F1和NDCG分数。在R2R和REVERIE数据集上，MSNav实现了最先进的性能，在成功率和路径长度加权成功率方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: MSNav通过模块化协同架构将脆弱的推理转化为稳健的集成智能，有效解决了VLN任务的核心挑战，为多模态导航系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to interpret natural
language instructions and navigate complex environments. Current approaches
often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM)
makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities,
including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory
overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we
propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules
into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a
robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module,
a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node
pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial
reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition;
and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust
actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space
(I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp),
which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving
higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art
performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success
weighted by Path Length (SPL).

Motivation: 土壤分类有助于改善土地管理、提高农业产量和解决环境问题，对农业、土木工程和自然资源管理等领域的发展至关重要

Method: 构建卷积神经网络模型，使用鲸鱼优化算法和粒子群优化算法选择最优超参数，采用准确率和F1分数作为评估指标

Result: 提出的方法在土壤类型多分类任务中取得了高效的结果

Conclusion: 结合群体智能算法优化CNN超参数的方法能够有效提升土壤图像分类的性能

Abstract: Classifying soil images contributes to better land management, increased
agricultural output, and practical solutions for environmental issues. The
development of various disciplines, particularly agriculture, civil
engineering, and natural resource management, is aided by understanding of soil
quality since it helps with risk reduction, performance improvement, and sound
decision-making . Artificial intelligence has recently been used in a number of
different fields. In this study, an intelligent model was constructed using
Convolutional Neural Networks to classify soil kinds, and machine learning
algorithms were used to enhance the performance of soil classification . To
achieve better implementation and performance of the Convolutional Neural
Networks algorithm and obtain valuable results for the process of classifying
soil type images, swarm algorithms were employed to obtain the best performance
by choosing Hyper parameters for the Convolutional Neural Networks network
using the Whale optimization algorithm and the Particle swarm optimization
algorithm, and comparing the results of using the two algorithms in the process
of multiple classification of soil types. The Accuracy and F1 measures were
adopted to test the system, and the results of the proposed work were efficient

### [6] [QA-VLM: Providing human-interpretable quality assessment for wire-feed laser additive manufacturing parts with Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16661)
*Qiaojie Zheng,Jiucai Zhang,Joy Gockel,Michael B. Wakin,Craig Brice,Xiaoli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出QA-VLM框架，利用视觉语言模型的注意力机制和推理能力，结合领域专业知识，为增材制造提供可解释的质量评估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图像的质量评估依赖人工专家，现有机器学习方法缺乏可解释性，限制了在实际应用中的可信度和采用率

Method: 开发QA-VLM框架，整合视觉语言模型的注意力机制和推理能力，并从同行评审期刊文章中提取应用特定知识来生成可解释的质量评估

Result: 在24个激光线材直接能量沉积单珠样品上评估，相比现成视觉语言模型，该框架在解释质量方面表现出更高的有效性和一致性

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力在增材制造应用中实现可信赖、可解释的质量评估

Abstract: Image-based quality assessment (QA) in additive manufacturing (AM) often
relies heavily on the expertise and constant attention of skilled human
operators. While machine learning and deep learning methods have been
introduced to assist in this task, they typically provide black-box outputs
without interpretable justifications, limiting their trust and adoption in
real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a novel QA-VLM framework that
leverages the attention mechanisms and reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models (VLMs), enriched with application-specific knowledge
distilled from peer-reviewed journal articles, to generate human-interpretable
quality assessments. Evaluated on 24 single-bead samples produced by laser wire
direct energy deposition (DED-LW), our framework demonstrates higher validity
and consistency in explanation quality than off-the-shelf VLMs. These results
highlight the potential of our approach to enable trustworthy, interpretable
quality assessment in AM applications.

### [7] [The Loupe: A Plug-and-Play Attention Module for Amplifying Discriminative Features in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16663)
*Naren Sengodan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出The Loupe轻量级注意力模块，插入预训练Transformer中，无需部件标注即可提升细粒度分类性能并提供可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度视觉分类需要识别细微局部特征，但现有Vision Transformer缺乏可解释性，在生物多样性监测和医疗诊断等关键应用中难以获得信任

Method: 设计可插入预训练骨干网络（如Swin Transformer）的轻量级注意力模块，使用复合损失函数端到端训练，隐式引导模型关注最具判别性的物体部位

Result: 在CUB-200-2011数据集上，Swin-Base模型准确率从85.40%提升至88.06%，增益2.66%，注意力图能有效定位语义有意义的特征

Conclusion: 简单内在注意力机制可作为强大正则化器，显著提升性能同时提供清晰可视化解释，为理解和信任模型决策提供有价值工具

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) is a critical and challenging area
within computer vision, demanding the identification of highly subtle,
localized visual cues. The importance of FGVC extends to critical applications
such as biodiversity monitoring and medical diagnostics, where precision is
paramount. While large-scale Vision Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art
performance, their decision-making processes often lack the interpretability
required for trust and verification in such domains. In this paper, we
introduce The Loupe, a novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play attention module
designed to be inserted into pre-trained backbones like the Swin Transformer.
The Loupe is trained end-to-end with a composite loss function that implicitly
guides the model to focus on the most discriminative object parts without
requiring explicit part-level annotations. Our unique contribution lies in
demonstrating that a simple, intrinsic attention mechanism can act as a
powerful regularizer, significantly boosting performance while simultaneously
providing clear visual explanations. Our experimental evaluation on the
challenging CUB-200-2011 dataset shows that The Loupe improves the accuracy of
a Swin-Base model from 85.40% to 88.06%, a significant gain of 2.66%.
Crucially, our qualitative analysis of the learned attention maps reveals that
The Loupe effectively localizes semantically meaningful features, providing a
valuable tool for understanding and trusting the model's decision-making
process.

### [8] [COVID19 Prediction Based On CT Scans Of Lungs Using DenseNet Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16670)
*Deborup Sanyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用卷积神经网络分析COVID-19患者的肺部CT扫描，预测感染严重程度（是否需要插管或导致死亡）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19大流行导致全球医疗系统崩溃，呼吸系统衰竭是主要死因。通过AI分析CT扫描可以帮助医生快速判断病情严重程度，缓解医疗资源短缺问题

Method: 采用卷积神经网络(CNN)模型，基于患者确诊后一个月内的肺部CT扫描数据进行训练和分析

Result: 模型能够根据CT扫描准确预测COVID-19感染的严重程度，区分预后良好和不良（需要插管或死亡）的情况

Conclusion: 基于CNN的CT扫描分析模型可以有效辅助医生评估COVID-19病情严重程度，提高诊断效率和准确性，有助于优化医疗资源配置

Abstract: COVID19 took the world by storm since December 2019. A highly infectious
communicable disease, COVID19 is caused by the SARSCoV2 virus. By March 2020,
the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID19 as a global pandemic. A
pandemic in the 21st century after almost 100 years was something the world was
not prepared for, which resulted in the deaths of around 1.6 million people
worldwide. The most common symptoms of COVID19 were associated with the
respiratory system and resembled a cold, flu, or pneumonia. After extensive
research, doctors and scientists concluded that the main reason for lives being
lost due to COVID19 was failure of the respiratory system. Patients were dying
gasping for breath. Top healthcare systems of the world were failing badly as
there was an acute shortage of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, and
ventilators. Many were dying without receiving any treatment at all. The aim of
this project is to help doctors decide the severity of COVID19 by reading the
patient's Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the lungs. Computer models are less
prone to human error, and Machine Learning or Neural Network models tend to
give better accuracy as training improves over time. We have decided to use a
Convolutional Neural Network model. Given that a patient tests positive, our
model will analyze the severity of COVID19 infection within one month of the
positive test result. The severity of the infection may be promising or
unfavorable (if it leads to intubation or death), based entirely on the CT
scans in the dataset.

*Fangxin Shang,Yuan Xia,Dalu Yang,Yahui Wang,Binglin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedRepBench是一个针对中文医疗报告结构化理解的新基准测试，包含1900份真实医疗报告，用于评估视觉语言模型在医疗报告解释方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏标准化基准来评估医疗报告的结构化解释质量，需要建立全面的评估体系来推动医疗文档理解技术的发展。

Method: 构建包含1900份中文医疗报告的基准数据集，采用客观评估（字段级召回率）和主观评估（LLM评分代理）两种协议，并使用GRPO方法优化视觉语言模型。

Result: 通过GRPO优化使中等规模VLM获得高达6%的召回率提升，OCR+LLM管道虽表现良好但存在布局盲区和延迟问题。

Conclusion: MedRepBench为医疗报告理解提供了标准化评估框架，揭示了当前方法的局限性，并强调了开发鲁棒性视觉基础报告理解系统的重要性。

Abstract: Medical report interpretation plays a crucial role in healthcare, enabling
both patient-facing explanations and effective information flow across clinical
systems. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated general document understanding capabilities, there
remains a lack of standardized benchmarks to assess structured interpretation
quality in medical reports. We introduce MedRepBench, a comprehensive benchmark
built from 1,900 de-identified real-world Chinese medical reports spanning
diverse departments, patient demographics, and acquisition formats. The
benchmark is designed primarily to evaluate end-to-end VLMs for structured
medical report understanding. To enable controlled comparisons, we also include
a text-only evaluation setting using high-quality OCR outputs combined with
LLMs, allowing us to estimate the upper-bound performance when character
recognition errors are minimized. Our evaluation framework supports two
complementary protocols: (1) an objective evaluation measuring field-level
recall of structured clinical items, and (2) an automated subjective evaluation
using a powerful LLM as a scoring agent to assess factuality, interpretability,
and reasoning quality. Based on the objective metric, we further design a
reward function and apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve
a mid-scale VLM, achieving up to 6% recall gain. We also observe that the
OCR+LLM pipeline, despite strong performance, suffers from layout-blindness and
latency issues, motivating further progress toward robust, fully vision-based
report understanding.

### [10] [Two-Stage Framework for Efficient UAV-Based Wildfire Video Analysis with Adaptive Compression and Fire Source Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16739)
*Yanbing Bai,Rui-Yang Ju,Lemeng Zhao,Junjie Hu,Jianchao Bi,Erick Mas,Shunichi Koshimura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级两阶段框架，用于无人机平台的实时野火监测和火源检测，通过策略网络压缩冗余视频帧并改进YOLOv8模型，在降低计算成本的同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在灾害应急响应中日益重要，但由于计算资源有限，无法独立运行大型模型进行实时视频分析，需要开发轻量高效的解决方案。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用策略网络识别和丢弃冗余视频片段，采用帧压缩技术和站点机制；第二阶段对分类为"火灾"的帧使用改进的YOLOv8模型进行火源定位。

Result: 实验结果表明，第一阶段在保持分类精度的同时显著降低计算成本；第二阶段相比基线方法在相似推理时间下获得更高检测精度。

Conclusion: 该框架为无人机平台提供了有效的实时野火监测解决方案，平衡了计算效率和检测精度，适用于资源受限的移动设备部署。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly important in
disaster emergency response by enabling real-time aerial video analysis. Due to
the limited computational resources available on UAVs, large models cannot be
run independently for real-time analysis. To overcome this challenge, we
propose a lightweight and efficient two-stage framework for real-time wildfire
monitoring and fire source detection on UAV platforms. Specifically, in Stage
1, we utilize a policy network to identify and discard redundant video clips
using frame compression techniques, thereby reducing computational costs. In
addition, we introduce a station point mechanism that leverages future frame
information within the sequential policy network to improve prediction
accuracy. In Stage 2, once the frame is classified as "fire", we employ the
improved YOLOv8 model to localize the fire source. We evaluate the Stage 1
method using the FLAME and HMDB51 datasets, and the Stage 2 method using the
Fire & Smoke dataset. Experimental results show that our method significantly
reduces computational costs while maintaining classification accuracy in Stage
1, and achieves higher detection accuracy with similar inference time in Stage
2 compared to baseline methods.

*Abdul Rehman Akbar,Usama Sajjad,Ziyu Su,Wencheng Li,Fei Xing,Jimmy Ruiz,Wei Chen,Muhammad Khalid Khan Niazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellEcoNet是一个新颖的空间感知深度学习框架，通过自然语言类比分析全玻片图像，将细胞视为单词、细胞邻域视为短语、组织结构视为句子，自动学习上下文依赖的病理语言，准确预测肺腺癌复发风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约70%的侵袭性肺腺癌患者在术后5年内复发，现有工具无法识别需要辅助治疗的患者，存在未满足的临床需求。

Method: 提出CellEcoNet框架，将全玻片图像建模为自然语言：细胞=单词，细胞邻域=短语，组织结构=句子，自动学习上下文依赖的病理语言，捕捉细微变异和空间相互作用的复发风险。

Result: 在456个H&E染色全玻片数据集上，CellEcoNet达到AUC:77.8%和HR:9.54的优异预测性能，显著优于IASLC分级系统(AUC:71.4%)、AJCC分期(AUC:64.0%)和其他计算方法(AUCs:62.2-67.4%)，在不同人口和临床亚组中表现一致公平。

Conclusion: CellEcoNet不仅提供了优越的预后预测能力，更通过解码肿瘤微环境的细胞"语言"，揭示了细微细胞变异如何编码复发风险，代表了病理学分析方法的范式转变。

Abstract: Despite surgical resection, ~70% of invasive lung adenocarcinoma (ILA)
patients recur within five years, and current tools fail to identify those
needing adjuvant therapy. To address this unmet clinical need, we introduce
CellEcoNet, a novel spatially aware deep learning framework that models whole
slide images (WSIs) through natural language analogy, defining a "language of
pathology," where cells act as words, cellular neighborhoods become phrases,
and tissue architecture forms sentences. CellEcoNet learns these
context-dependent meanings automatically, capturing how subtle variations and
spatial interactions derive recurrence risk. On a dataset of 456 H&E-stained
WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8% HR:9.54),
outperforming IASLC grading system (AUC:71.4% HR:2.36), AJCC Stage (AUC:64.0%
HR:1.17) and state-of-the-art computational methods (AUCs:62.2-67.4%).
CellEcoNet demonstrated fairness and consistent performance across diverse
demographic and clinical subgroups. Beyond prognosis, CellEcoNet marks a
paradigm shift by decoding the tumor microenvironment's cellular "language" to
reveal how subtle cell variations encode recurrence risk.

### [12] [A Framework for Benchmarking Fairness-Utility Trade-offs in Text-to-Image Models via Pareto Frontiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16752)
*Marco N. Bochernitsan,Rodrigo C. Barros,Lucas S. Kupssinskü*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用帕累托最优前沿评估文本到图像生成模型公平性和效用的方法，能够比较不同模型并找到最优超参数配置


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型的公平性评估主要依赖定性判断或有限比较，缺乏可重复的评估方法，无法同时评估公平性和效用

Method: 使用帕累托最优前沿分析超参数化去偏方法的公平性和效用权衡，分别采用归一化香农熵和ClipScore评估公平性和效用

Result: 评估了Stable Diffusion、Fair Diffusion、SDXL、DeCoDi和FLUX等模型，发现大多数默认超参数配置在公平性-效用空间中被支配，可以轻松找到更好的超参数

Conclusion: 该方法为文本到图像生成模型提供了可重复的公平性和效用评估框架，能够识别最优配置并促进负责任的AI发展

Abstract: Achieving fairness in text-to-image generation demands mitigating social
biases without compromising visual fidelity, a challenge critical to
responsible AI. Current fairness evaluation procedures for text-to-image models
rely on qualitative judgment or narrow comparisons, which limit the capacity to
assess both fairness and utility in these models and prevent reproducible
assessment of debiasing methods. Existing approaches typically employ ad-hoc,
human-centered visual inspections that are both error-prone and difficult to
replicate. We propose a method for evaluating fairness and utility in
text-to-image models using Pareto-optimal frontiers across hyperparametrization
of debiasing methods. Our method allows for comparison between distinct
text-to-image models, outlining all configurations that optimize fairness for a
given utility and vice-versa. To illustrate our evaluation method, we use
Normalized Shannon Entropy and ClipScore for fairness and utility evaluation,
respectively. We assess fairness and utility in Stable Diffusion, Fair
Diffusion, SDXL, DeCoDi, and FLUX text-to-image models. Our method shows that
most default hyperparameterizations of the text-to-image model are dominated
solutions in the fairness-utility space, and it is straightforward to find
better hyperparameters.

TL;DR: WebMMU是一个多语言基准测试，评估网站视觉问答、代码编辑和原型到代码生成三个核心Web任务，发现当前多模态大语言模型在推理、代码功能保持和多语言支持方面存在显著局限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试将这些Web任务分开处理，需要统一的评估框架来测试模型在复杂多步推理、精确元素定位和功能性UI理解编码方面的能力

Method: 使用专家标注的真实Web数据构建多语言基准，统一评估三个核心Web任务：网站视觉问答、HTML/CSS/JavaScript代码编辑、原型到代码生成

Result: 多模态大语言模型在基础信息提取方面表现良好，但在推理和定位、保持代码功能的编辑、生成保持层次结构和支持多语言内容的设计到代码方面存在困难

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs存在关键局限性，需要改进多模态和跨语言推理能力，以构建能够自动化多样化Web开发任务的未来Web代理

Abstract: We present WebMMU, a multilingual benchmark that evaluates three core web
tasks: (1) website visual question answering, (2) code editing involving
HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and (3) mockup-to-code generation. Unlike prior benchmarks
that treat these tasks separately, WebMMU unifies them using expert-annotated,
real-world web data to assess models' abilities in complex multi-step
reasoning, precise element grounding, and functional UI comprehension and
coding. Our evaluation shows that while multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) perform well on basic information extraction, they struggle with
reasoning and grounding, editing code to preserve functionality, and generating
design-to-code that maintains hierarchy and supports multilingual content.
These findings reveal key limitations in current MLLMs and underscore the need
for improved multimodal and cross-lingual reasoning to build future web agents
capable of automating diverse web development tasks.

Abstract: Achieving robust performance and fairness across diverse patient populations
remains a challenge in developing clinically deployable deep learning models
for diagnostic imaging. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising
strategy to address limitations in dataset scale and diversity. We introduce
RoentGen-v2, a text-to-image diffusion model for chest radiographs that enables
fine-grained control over both radiographic findings and patient demographic
attributes, including sex, age, and race/ethnicity. RoentGen-v2 is the first
model to generate clinically plausible images with demographic conditioning,
facilitating the creation of a large, demographically balanced synthetic
dataset comprising over 565,000 images. We use this large synthetic dataset to
evaluate optimal training pipelines for downstream disease classification
models. In contrast to prior work that combines real and synthetic data
naively, we propose an improved training strategy that leverages synthetic data
for supervised pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Through
extensive evaluation on over 137,000 chest radiographs from five institutions,
we demonstrate that synthetic pretraining consistently improves model
performance, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and fairness
across demographic subgroups. Across datasets, synthetic pretraining led to a
6.5% accuracy increase in the performance of downstream classification models,
compared to a modest 2.7% increase when naively combining real and synthetic
data. We observe this performance improvement simultaneously with the reduction
of the underdiagnosis fairness gap by 19.3%. These results highlight the
potential of synthetic imaging to advance equitable and generalizable medical
deep learning under real-world data constraints. We open source our code,
trained models, and synthetic dataset at

Motivation: 现有3D物体检测方法受限于闭集假设，难以识别现实场景中的新物体及其属性，需要开发能够处理未知类别和属性的开放词汇检测系统。

Method: 提出OVODA框架，采用基础模型特征拼接、提示调优策略、视角指定提示和水平翻转增强等专门技术，联合检测物体属性和空间关系等。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2数据集上，OVODA在无需新类别锚点尺寸的条件下，在开放词汇3D物体检测方面优于最先进方法，并成功识别物体属性。

Conclusion: OVODA框架有效解决了开放词汇3D检测问题，同时发布了带有全面属性标注的OVAD数据集，推动了该研究方向的发展。

Abstract: 3D object detection plays a crucial role in autonomous systems, yet existing
methods are limited by closed-set assumptions and struggle to recognize novel
objects and their attributes in real-world scenarios. We propose OVODA, a novel
framework enabling both open-vocabulary 3D object and attribute detection with
no need to know the novel class anchor size. OVODA uses foundation models to
bridge the semantic gap between 3D features and texts while jointly detecting
attributes, e.g., spatial relationships, motion states, etc. To facilitate such
research direction, we propose OVAD, a new dataset that supplements existing 3D
object detection benchmarks with comprehensive attribute annotations. OVODA
incorporates several key innovations, including foundation model feature
concatenation, prompt tuning strategies, and specialized techniques for
attribute detection, including perspective-specified prompts and horizontal
flip augmentation. Our results on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets
show that under the condition of no given anchor sizes of novel classes, OVODA
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in open-vocabulary 3D object detection
while successfully recognizing object attributes. Our OVAD dataset is released
here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16904069 .

Conclusion: 该网络显著提高了大规模天文巡天中超新星检测的准确性和效率，展示了Transformer架构在天文图像处理中的优势

Abstract: We introduce a transformer-based neural network for the accurate
classification of real and bogus transient detections in astronomical images.
This network advances beyond the conventional convolutional neural network
(CNN) methods, widely used in image processing tasks, by adopting an
architecture better suited for detailed pixel-by-pixel comparison. The
architecture enables efficient analysis of search and template images only,
thus removing the necessity for computationally-expensive difference imaging,
while maintaining high performance. Our primary evaluation was conducted using
the autoScan dataset from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), where the network
achieved a classification accuracy of 97.4% and diminishing performance utility
for difference image as the size of the training set grew. Further experiments
with DES data confirmed that the network can operate at a similar level even
when the input images are not centered on the supernova candidate. These
findings highlight the network's effectiveness in enhancing both accuracy and
efficiency of supernova detection in large-scale astronomical surveys.

TL;DR: NinA使用归一化流替代扩散模型作为VLA的动作解码器，实现单次采样，显著提升推理速度，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型作为动作解码器需要多次迭代去噪步骤，限制了在需要高频控制的真实世界应用中的实用性。

Method: 用归一化流(NF)替代扩散动作解码器，通过可逆变换实现单次采样，集成到FLOWER VLA架构并在LIBERO基准上微调。

Result: NinA在相同训练条件下与基于扩散的解码器性能相当，但推理速度显著更快。

Conclusion: NinA为高效、高频的VLA控制提供了一条有前景的路径，且不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a
two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM)
encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps
these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely
adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal
action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps
at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their
practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In
this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive
alter- native to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion
action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling
through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We
integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO
benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its
diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving
substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a
promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without
compromising performance.

Motivation: 6G时代需要大规模天线阵列和精确空间信道信息，传统信道建模方法在空间分辨率、效率和可扩展性方面面临挑战，现有辐射场方法存在几何不准确和昂贵监督的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：第一阶段使用平面高斯几何基元实现密集表面对齐的场景重建；第二阶段结合结构化射频辐射场和多视图损失准确建模无线电传播行为。

Result: 相比现有辐射场方法，RF-PGS显著提高了重建精度，降低了训练成本，实现了无线信道的高效表示。

Conclusion: RF-PGS为可扩展的6G空间CSI建模提供了实用解决方案，解决了传统方法和现有辐射场方法的局限性。

Abstract: In the 6G era, the demand for higher system throughput and the implementation
of emerging 6G technologies require large-scale antenna arrays and accurate
spatial channel state information (Spatial-CSI). Traditional channel modeling
approaches, such as empirical models, ray tracing, and measurement-based
methods, face challenges in spatial resolution, efficiency, and scalability.
Radiance field-based methods have emerged as promising alternatives but still
suffer from geometric inaccuracy and costly supervision. This paper proposes
RF-PGS, a novel framework that reconstructs high-fidelity radio propagation
paths from only sparse path loss spectra. By introducing Planar Gaussians as
geometry primitives with certain RF-specific optimizations, RF-PGS achieves
dense, surface-aligned scene reconstruction in the first geometry training
stage. In the subsequent Radio Frequency (RF) training stage, the proposed
fully-structured radio radiance, combined with a tailored multi-view loss,
accurately models radio propagation behavior. Compared to prior radiance field
methods, RF-PGS significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, reduces
training costs, and enables efficient representation of wireless channels,
offering a practical solution for scalable 6G Spatial-CSI modeling.

Conclusion: GPO框架通过在高梯度区域策略性地锚定节点，确保鲁棒的梯度流，有效解决了纹理缺失区域的梯度消失问题，实现了优异的视网膜图像配准性能。

Abstract: Deformable retinal image registration is notoriously difficult due to large
homogeneous regions and sparse but critical vascular features, which cause
limited gradient signals in standard learning-based frameworks. In this paper,
we introduce Gaussian Primitive Optimization (GPO), a novel iterative framework
that performs structured message passing to overcome these challenges. After an
initial coarse alignment, we extract keypoints at salient anatomical structures
(e.g., major vessels) to serve as a minimal set of descriptor-based control
nodes (DCN). Each node is modelled as a Gaussian primitive with trainable
position, displacement, and radius, thus adapting its spatial influence to
local deformation scales. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Gaussian interpolation
then blends and propagates displacement signals from these information-rich
nodes to construct a globally coherent displacement field; focusing
interpolation on the top (K) neighbors reduces computational overhead while
preserving local detail. By strategically anchoring nodes in high-gradient
regions, GPO ensures robust gradient flow, mitigating vanishing gradient signal
in textureless areas. The framework is optimized end-to-end via a multi-term
loss that enforces both keypoint consistency and intensity alignment.
Experiments on the FIRE dataset show that GPO reduces the target registration
error from 6.2\,px to ~2.4\,px and increases the AUC at 25\,px from 0.770 to
0.938, substantially outperforming existing methods. The source code can be

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been widely applied across
various fields due to their powerful perceptual and reasoning capabilities. In
the realm of psychology, these models hold promise for a deeper understanding
of human emotions and behaviors. However, recent research primarily focuses on
enhancing their emotion recognition abilities, leaving the substantial
potential in emotion reasoning, which is crucial for improving the naturalness
and effectiveness of human-machine interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we
introduce a multi-turn multimodal emotion understanding and reasoning (MTMEUR)
benchmark, which encompasses 1,451 video data from real-life scenarios, along
with 5,101 progressive questions. These questions cover various aspects,
including emotion recognition, potential causes of emotions, future action
prediction, etc. Besides, we propose a multi-agent framework, where each agent
specializes in a specific aspect, such as background context, character
dynamics, and event details, to improve the system's reasoning capabilities.
Furthermore, we conduct experiments with existing MLLMs and our agent-based
method on the proposed benchmark, revealing that most models face significant
challenges with this task.

TL;DR: Delta-SVD是一种无需训练的后处理压缩方法，通过SVD分解DreamBooth微调产生的权重增量，利用其低秩特性实现高效压缩，保持生成质量的同时显著减少存储开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DreamBooth等个性化文本到图像模型需要微调大规模扩散模型，导致存储大量特定主体模型时产生显著的开销问题。

Method: 首先对权重增量进行奇异值分解(SVD)，然后采用基于能量的秩截断策略来平衡压缩效率和重建保真度，压缩后的模型完全即插即用，可在推理时实时重建。

Result: 在多主体数据集上的实验表明，Delta-SVD实现了显著的压缩效果，在CLIP分数、SSIM和FID等生成质量指标上损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该方法为个性化扩散模型的可扩展和高效部署提供了实用解决方案，特别适用于需要存储和部署大规模主体定制化的实际应用场景。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image models such as DreamBooth require fine-tuning
large-scale diffusion backbones, resulting in significant storage overhead when
maintaining many subject-specific models. We present Delta-SVD, a post-hoc,
training-free compression method that targets the parameter weights update
induced by DreamBooth fine-tuning. Our key observation is that these delta
weights exhibit strong low-rank structure due to the sparse and localized
nature of personalization. Delta-SVD first applies Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) to factorize the weight deltas, followed by an energy-based rank
truncation strategy to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction
fidelity. The resulting compressed models are fully plug-and-play and can be
re-constructed on-the-fly during inference. Notably, the proposed approach is
simple, efficient, and preserves the original model architecture. Experiments
on a multiple subject dataset demonstrate that Delta-SVD achieves substantial
compression with negligible loss in generation quality measured by CLIP score,
SSIM and FID. Our method enables scalable and efficient deployment of
personalized diffusion models, making it a practical solution for real-world
applications that require storing and deploying large-scale subject
customizations.

Motivation: 理解视觉内容如何传达情感在社交媒体时代至关重要，但情感感知与复杂的场景级语义紧密相关，是一个具有挑战性的问题。

Method: 提出MLLMsent框架，从三个角度研究多模态大语言模型的情感推理能力：(1)直接图像情感分类；(2)关联预训练LLM分析自动生成的图像描述；(3)在情感标注图像描述上微调LLM。

Result: 在基准测试中，微调方法表现最佳，比Lexicon、CNN和Transformer基线分别高出30.9%、64.8%和42.4%。跨数据集测试中，未经新数据训练仍比最佳竞争对手高出8.26%。

Conclusion: 该视觉推理方案具有推进情感计算的潜力，同时为未来研究建立了新的基准。

Abstract: Understanding how visual content communicates sentiment is critical in an era
where online interaction is increasingly dominated by this kind of media on
social platforms. However, this remains a challenging problem, as sentiment
perception is closely tied to complex, scene-level semantics. In this paper, we
propose an original framework, MLLMsent, to investigate the sentiment reasoning
capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through three
perspectives: (1) using those MLLMs for direct sentiment classification from
images; (2) associating them with pre-trained LLMs for sentiment analysis on
automatically generated image descriptions; and (3) fine-tuning the LLMs on
sentiment-labeled image descriptions. Experiments on a recent and established
benchmark demonstrate that our proposal, particularly the fine-tuned approach,
achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming Lexicon-, CNN-, and
Transformer-based baselines by up to 30.9%, 64.8%, and 42.4%, respectively,
across different levels of evaluators' agreement and sentiment polarity
categories. Remarkably, in a cross-dataset test, without any training on these
new data, our model still outperforms, by up to 8.26%, the best runner-up,
which has been trained directly on them. These results highlight the potential
of the proposed visual reasoning scheme for advancing affective computing,
while also establishing new benchmarks for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决恶劣天气条件下视觉信息损失问题，现有方法缺乏对文本信息的有效分类和深入分析，需要更好的语义感知能力。

Method: 提出统一权重架构，包含全局特征感知模块（使用BLIP生成字幕提取场景特征和主要退化类型）和局部模块（使用ChatGPT详细描述关注具体退化效果），通过文本描述约束融合图像生成。

Result: 在复杂天气条件和下游任务中优于当前最先进方法，实验证明其有效性。

Conclusion: AWM-Fuse通过结合全局和局部文本感知，有效提升了恶劣天气条件下的多模态图像融合性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multi-modality image fusion (MMIF) in adverse weather aims to address the
loss of visual information caused by weather-related degradations, providing
clearer scene representations. Although less studies have attempted to
incorporate textual information to improve semantic perception, they often lack
effective categorization and thorough analysis of textual content. In response,
we propose AWM-Fuse, a novel fusion method for adverse weather conditions,
designed to handle multiple degradations through global and local text
perception within a unified, shared weight architecture. In particular, a
global feature perception module leverages BLIP-produced captions to extract
overall scene features and identify primary degradation types, thus promoting
generalization across various adverse weather conditions. Complementing this,
the local module employs detailed scene descriptions produced by ChatGPT to
concentrate on specific degradation effects through concrete textual cues,
thereby capturing finer details. Furthermore, textual descriptions are used to
constrain the generation of fusion images, effectively steering the network
learning process toward better alignment with real semantic labels, thereby
promoting the learning of more meaningful visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AWM-Fuse outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods in complex weather conditions and downstream tasks. Our code is

Conclusion: SAEViT为各种基础视觉任务提供了一个轻量级解决方案，在计算效率和性能之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has prevailed in computer vision tasks due to its
strong long-range dependency modelling ability. However, its large model size
with high computational cost and weak local feature modeling ability hinder its
application in real scenarios. To balance computation efficiency and
performance, we propose SAEViT (Sparse-Attention-Efficient-ViT), a lightweight
ViT based model with convolution blocks, in this paper to achieve efficient
downstream vision tasks. Specifically, SAEViT introduces a Sparsely Aggregated
Attention (SAA) module that performs adaptive sparse sampling based on image
redundancy and recovers the feature map via deconvolution operation, which
significantly reduces the computational complexity of attention operations. In
addition, a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) layer is developed
to enhance inter-channel information exchange through feature decomposition and
redistribution, mitigating redundancy in traditional feed-forward networks
(FNN). Finally, a hierarchical pyramid structure with embedded depth-wise
separable convolutional blocks (DWSConv) is devised to further strengthen
convolutional features. Extensive experiments on mainstream datasets show that
SAEViT achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3\% and 79.6\% on the ImageNet-1K
classification task with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs, respectively,
demonstrating a lightweight solution for various fundamental vision tasks.

Motivation: 现有图像质量评估方法过度关注整体分数拟合，忽略了人类通常从多个维度评估图像质量的事实

Result: MDIQA在实验中表现出优越性能，并能有效灵活地应用于图像恢复任务

Conclusion: 多维图像质量评估框架能更好地模拟人类视觉感知，为图像恢复提供更灵活的用户偏好对齐方案

Abstract: Recent advancements in image quality assessment (IQA), driven by
sophisticated deep neural network designs, have significantly improved the
ability to approach human perceptions. However, most existing methods are
obsessed with fitting the overall score, neglecting the fact that humans
typically evaluate image quality from different dimensions before arriving at
an overall quality assessment. To overcome this problem, we propose a
multi-dimensional image quality assessment (MDIQA) framework. Specifically, we
model image quality across various perceptual dimensions, including five
technical and four aesthetic dimensions, to capture the multifaceted nature of
human visual perception within distinct branches. Each branch of our MDIQA is
initially trained under the guidance of a separate dimension, and the
respective features are then amalgamated to generate the final IQA score.
Additionally, when the MDIQA model is ready, we can deploy it for a flexible
training of image restoration (IR) models, enabling the restoration results to
better align with varying user preferences through the adjustment of perceptual
dimension weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MDIQA achieves
superior performance and can be effectively and flexibly applied to image
restoration tasks. The code is available: https://github.com/YaoShunyu19/MDIQA.

Result: SEGS显著减少了Janus伪影，实现了更好的几何对齐和视角一致性，且无需重新训练或权重修改。

Conclusion: SEGS通过采样时的多视角一致性约束，有效解决了文本到3D生成中的视角偏见问题，是一个训练无关的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation often suffers from the Janus problem, where objects
look correct from the front but collapse into duplicated or distorted geometry
from other angles. We attribute this failure to viewpoint bias in 2D diffusion
priors, which propagates into 3D optimization. To address this, we propose
Structural Energy-Guided Sampling (SEGS), a training-free, plug-and-play
framework that enforces multi-view consistency entirely at sampling time. SEGS
defines a structural energy in a PCA subspace of intermediate U-Net features
and injects its gradients into the denoising trajectory, steering geometry
toward the intended viewpoint while preserving appearance fidelity. Integrated
seamlessly into SDS/VSD pipelines, SEGS significantly reduces Janus artifacts,
achieving improved geometric alignment and viewpoint consistency without
retraining or weight modification.

*Yudong Hu,Yueju Han,Rui Sun,Jinke Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSPCaps是一种新颖的多尺度胶囊网络架构，通过多尺度特征提取、统一补丁化胶囊层和跨协议路由机制，有效解决了传统胶囊网络忽略多尺度信息和特征融合困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有胶囊网络通常依赖单一高层特征图，忽略了多尺度特征的丰富互补信息，且传统特征融合策略难以协调多尺度特征差异，导致分类性能不佳。

Method: 提出MSPCaps架构，包含三个核心组件：多尺度ResNet骨干网络(MSRB)提取多尺度特征；补丁化胶囊层(PatchifyCaps)将多尺度特征统一划分为主胶囊；跨协议路由(CAR)块通过识别最大协议跨尺度预测对来自适应路由多尺度胶囊。

Result: MSPCaps展现出卓越的可扩展性和鲁棒性，在分类准确率方面持续超越多个基线方法，参数配置从高效的Tiny模型(344.3K参数)到强大的Large模型(10.9M参数)。

Conclusion: 该方法在推进特征表示学习方面具有巨大潜力，通过有效整合多尺度特征学习和高效胶囊路由，显著提升了胶囊网络的性能表现。

Abstract: Capsule Network (CapsNet) has demonstrated significant potential in visual
recognition by capturing spatial relationships and part-whole hierarchies for
learning equivariant feature representations. However, existing CapsNet and
variants often rely on a single high-level feature map, overlooking the rich
complementary information from multi-scale features. Furthermore, conventional
feature fusion strategies (e.g., addition and concatenation) struggle to
reconcile multi-scale feature discrepancies, leading to suboptimal
classification performance. To address these limitations, we propose the
Multi-Scale Patchify Capsule Network (MSPCaps), a novel architecture that
integrates multi-scale feature learning and efficient capsule routing.
Specifically, MSPCaps consists of three key components: a Multi-Scale ResNet
Backbone (MSRB), a Patchify Capsule Layer (PatchifyCaps), and Cross-Agreement
Routing (CAR) blocks. First, the MSRB extracts diverse multi-scale feature
representations from input images, preserving both fine-grained details and
global contextual information. Second, the PatchifyCaps partitions these
multi-scale features into primary capsules using a uniform patch size,
equipping the model with the ability to learn from diverse receptive fields.
Finally, the CAR block adaptively routes the multi-scale capsules by
identifying cross-scale prediction pairs with maximum agreement. Unlike the
simple concatenation of multiple self-routing blocks, CAR ensures that only the
most coherent capsules contribute to the final voting. Our proposed MSPCaps
achieves remarkable scalability and superior robustness, consistently
surpassing multiple baseline methods in terms of classification accuracy, with
configurations ranging from a highly efficient Tiny model (344.3K parameters)
to a powerful Large model (10.9M parameters), highlighting its potential in
advancing feature representation learning.

TL;DR: CC-CMR是一种基于对比学习和跨模态对齐的框架，用于无钆对比剂的心肌病筛查，通过将电影CMR与LGE序列的潜在空间对齐，在电影CMR中编码纤维化特异性病理信息，实现了94.3%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏磁共振(CMR)是心肌病诊断的金标准，但依赖钆对比剂和人工密集解读限制了其在人群规模筛查中的应用。需要开发无钆、自动化的筛查方法。

Method: 提出对比学习和跨模态对齐框架，通过特征交互模块同时优化诊断精度和跨模态特征一致性，并采用不确定性引导的自适应训练机制动态校准任务特定目标。

Result: 在多中心231名受试者数据上评估，CC-CMR达到0.943的准确率(95% CI: 0.886-0.986)，比最先进的仅电影CMR模型提升4.3%，同时消除了对钆的依赖。

Conclusion: CC-CMR展示了在广泛人群和医疗环境中进行心肌病筛查的临床可行性，为无钆对比剂的心脏病筛查提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cardiomyopathy, a principal contributor to heart failure and sudden cardiac
mortality, demands precise early screening. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR),
recognized as the diagnostic 'gold standard' through multiparametric protocols,
holds the potential to serve as an accurate screening tool. However, its
reliance on gadolinium contrast and labor-intensive interpretation hinders
population-scale deployment. We propose CC-CMR, a Contrastive Learning and
Cross-Modal alignment framework for gadolinium-free cardiomyopathy screening
using cine CMR sequences. By aligning the latent spaces of cine CMR and Late
Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) sequences, our model encodes fibrosis-specific
pathology into cine CMR embeddings. A Feature Interaction Module concurrently
optimizes diagnostic precision and cross-modal feature congruence, augmented by
an uncertainty-guided adaptive training mechanism that dynamically calibrates
task-specific objectives to ensure model generalizability. Evaluated on
multi-center data from 231 subjects, CC-CMR achieves accuracy of 0.943 (95% CI:
0.886-0.986), outperforming state-of-the-art cine-CMR-only models by 4.3% while
eliminating gadolinium dependency, demonstrating its clinical viability for
wide range of populations and healthcare environments.

TL;DR: Invert3D是一个无需重新训练的3D内容个性化框架，通过建立3D表示与文本嵌入空间的对齐，实现基于自然语言的3D内容操作


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D个性化方法主要依赖基于知识蒸馏的方法，需要计算昂贵的重新训练过程，缺乏高效的3D内容个性化解决方案

Method: 开发相机条件化的3D到文本逆向机制，将3D内容投影到与文本嵌入对齐的3D嵌入空间中

Result: 实验证明Invert3D能够有效实现3D内容的个性化

Conclusion: 该方法通过建立3D与文本嵌入的对齐，实现了无需重新训练的3D内容个性化，为3D内容创作提供了便利

Abstract: Recent advances in NeRF and 3DGS have significantly enhanced the efficiency
and quality of 3D content synthesis. However, efficient personalization of
generated 3D content remains a critical challenge. Current 3D personalization
approaches predominantly rely on knowledge distillation-based methods, which
require computationally expensive retraining procedures. To address this
challenge, we propose \textbf{Invert3D}, a novel framework for convenient 3D
content personalization. Nowadays, vision-language models such as CLIP enable
direct image personalization through aligned vision-text embedding spaces.
However, the inherent structural differences between 3D content and 2D images
preclude direct application of these techniques to 3D personalization. Our
approach bridges this gap by establishing alignment between 3D representations
and text embedding spaces. Specifically, we develop a camera-conditioned
3D-to-text inverse mechanism that projects 3D contents into a 3D embedding
aligned with text embeddings. This alignment enables efficient manipulation and
personalization of 3D content through natural language prompts, eliminating the
need for computationally retraining procedures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Invert3D achieves effective personalization of 3D content. Our
work is available at: https://github.com/qsong2001/Invert3D.

*Krishna Kanth Nakka,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAT方法通过针对神经网络中的特定神经元进行攻击，而不是传统的层级别攻击，显著提高了对抗性扰动的可转移性，在跨模型和跨域设置中分别超过现有基线14%和4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常在源模型的单个中间层最大化干净图像和对抗图像之间的嵌入分离，但这种方法往往过度关注少数代表相似概念的神经元，而忽略了层内其他神经元。

Method: 提出Neuron Attack for Transferability (NAT)，从嵌入级别的分离转向更基础的神经元特定方法，通过针对单个神经元来破坏神经网络的核心单元。

Result: 在41个不同的ImageNet模型和9个细粒度模型上进行广泛实验，NAT在跨模型设置中超过现有基线14%以上，在跨域设置中超过4%。通过利用训练生成器的互补攻击能力，仅用10次查询就能获得令人印象深刻的欺骗率。

Conclusion: 针对特定神经元的攻击方法为跨不同模型的可转移性提供了共同基础，显著提高了对抗性攻击的效果和效率。

Abstract: The generation of transferable adversarial perturbations typically involves
training a generator to maximize embedding separation between clean and
adversarial images at a single mid-layer of a source model. In this work, we
build on this approach and introduce Neuron Attack for Transferability (NAT), a
method designed to target specific neuron within the embedding. Our approach is
motivated by the observation that previous layer-level optimizations often
disproportionately focus on a few neurons representing similar concepts,
leaving other neurons within the attacked layer minimally affected. NAT shifts
the focus from embedding-level separation to a more fundamental,
neuron-specific approach. We find that targeting individual neurons effectively
disrupts the core units of the neural network, providing a common basis for
transferability across different models. Through extensive experiments on 41
diverse ImageNet models and 9 fine-grained models, NAT achieves fooling rates
that surpass existing baselines by over 14\% in cross-model and 4\% in
cross-domain settings. Furthermore, by leveraging the complementary attacking
capabilities of the trained generators, we achieve impressive fooling rates
within just 10 queries. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常只提供最终评分而缺乏解释性分析，限制了在体育、医疗和机器人等领域的实际应用，需要能够提供结构化详细反馈的动作评估系统。

Method: 采用Stepwise Action Reasoning（分步动作推理链）进行结构化评估，结合Hierarchical Policy Learning（分层策略学习）通过强化学习优化子动作动态与高层动作质量的对齐。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出优越性能，证明了该方法能够提供准确且可解释的动作评估。

Conclusion: HieroAction通过结合分步推理和分层学习策略，成功实现了准确、结构化且可解释的人类动作评估，为相关领域提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating human actions with clear and detailed feedback is important in
areas such as sports, healthcare, and robotics, where decisions rely not only
on final outcomes but also on interpretable reasoning. However, most existing
methods provide only a final score without explanation or detailed analysis,
limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we introduce
HieroAction, a vision-language model that delivers accurate and structured
assessments of human actions. HieroAction builds on two key ideas: (1) Stepwise
Action Reasoning, a tailored chain of thought process designed specifically for
action assessment, which guides the model to evaluate actions step by step,
from overall recognition through sub action analysis to final scoring, thus
enhancing interpretability and structured understanding; and (2) Hierarchical
Policy Learning, a reinforcement learning strategy that enables the model to
learn fine grained sub action dynamics and align them with high level action
quality, thereby improving scoring precision. The reasoning pathway structures
the evaluation process, while policy learning refines each stage through reward
based optimization. Their integration ensures accurate and interpretable
assessments, as demonstrated by superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: RPD-Diff通过结合物理引导和区域自适应机制，有效解决了密集非均匀雾霾条件下的去雾挑战，为复杂雾霾场景下的能见度增强提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Single-image dehazing under dense and non-uniform haze conditions remains
challenging due to severe information degradation and spatial heterogeneity.
Traditional diffusion-based dehazing methods struggle with insufficient
generation conditioning and lack of adaptability to spatially varying haze
distributions, which leads to suboptimal restoration. To address these
limitations, we propose RPD-Diff, a Region-adaptive Physics-guided Dehazing
Diffusion Model for robust visibility enhancement in complex haze scenarios.
RPD-Diff introduces a Physics-guided Intermediate State Targeting (PIST)
strategy, which leverages physical priors to reformulate the diffusion Markov
chain by generation target transitions, mitigating the issue of insufficient
conditioning in dense haze scenarios. Additionally, the Haze-Aware Denoising
Timestep Predictor (HADTP) dynamically adjusts patch-specific denoising
timesteps employing a transmission map cross-attention mechanism, adeptly
managing non-uniform haze distributions. Extensive experiments across four
real-world datasets demonstrate that RPD-Diff achieves state-of-the-art
performance in challenging dense and non-uniform haze scenarios, delivering
high-quality, haze-free images with superior detail clarity and color fidelity.

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂环境中的机器人仿真提供了高保真视觉和精确标记检测能力，在农业等具有挑战性的真实场景中具有重要应用价值

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D simulation is critical for training mobile robots, but its
traditional reliance on mesh-based representations often struggle in complex
environments, such as densely packed greenhouses featuring occlusions and
repetitive structures. Recent neural rendering methods, like Gaussian Splatting
(GS), achieve remarkable visual realism but lack flexibility to incorporate
fiducial markers, which are essential for robotic localization and control. We
propose a hybrid framework that combines the photorealism of GS with structured
marker representations. Our core contribution is a novel algorithm for
efficiently generating GS-based fiducial markers (e.g., AprilTags) within
cluttered scenes. Experiments show that our approach outperforms traditional
image-fitting techniques in both efficiency and pose-estimation accuracy. We
further demonstrate the framework's potential in a greenhouse simulation. This
agricultural setting serves as a challenging testbed, as its combination of
dense foliage, similar-looking elements, and occlusions pushes the limits of
perception, thereby highlighting the framework's value for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出人群计数新模型LIMM，强调局部建模能力，通过窗口划分和对比学习策略，在保持大尺寸个体计数能力的同时显著提升高密度人群计数性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新思考人群计数的本质特征：个体（人头）在图像中占比很小，现有方法却追求大感受野。提出应强调模型的局部建模能力。

Method: 设计LIMM模型：1）网格窗口划分输入；2）窗口级对比学习增强局部密度区分能力；3）全局注意力模块处理偶尔出现的大尺寸个体。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上实验表明，模型显著提升局部建模能力（如JHU-Crowd++高密度子集MAE提升8.7%），同时保持大尺寸个体计数能力，达到state-of-the-art性能。

Conclusion: 强调局部建模能力是人群计数的重要设计原则，LIMM模型通过创新的窗口策略和对比学习有效解决了高密度人群计数难题。

Abstract: The motivation of this paper originates from rethinking an essential
characteristic of crowd counting: individuals (heads of humans) in the crowd
counting task typically occupy a very small portion of the image. This
characteristic has never been the focus of existing works: they typically use
the same backbone as other visual tasks and pursue a large receptive field.
This drives us to propose a new model design principle of crowd counting:
emphasizing local modeling capability of the model. We follow the principle and
design a crowd counting model named Local Information Matters Model (LIMM). The
main innovation lies in two strategies: a window partitioning design that
applies grid windows to the model input, and a window-wise contrastive learning
design to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between local density
levels. Moreover, a global attention module is applied to the end of the model
to handle the occasionally occurring large-sized individuals. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets illustrate that the proposed model
shows a significant improvement in local modeling capability (8.7\% in MAE on
the JHU-Crowd++ high-density subset for example), without compromising its
ability to count large-sized ones, which achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: 3D mapping in dynamic environments poses a challenge for modern researchers
in robotics and autonomous transportation. There are no universal
representations for dynamic 3D scenes that incorporate multimodal data such as

problem. It proposes a taxonomy of methods for constructing multimodal 3D maps,
classifying contemporary approaches based on scene types and representations,
learning methods, and practical applications. Using this taxonomy, a brief
structured analysis of recent methods is provided. The article also describes
an original modular method called M3DMap, designed for object-aware
construction of multimodal 3D maps for both static and dynamic scenes. It
consists of several interconnected components: a neural multimodal object
segmentation and tracking module; an odometry estimation module, including
trainable algorithms; a module for 3D map construction and updating with
various implementations depending on the desired scene representation; and a
multimodal data retrieval module. The article highlights original
implementations of these modules and their advantages in solving various
practical tasks, from 3D object grounding to mobile manipulation. Additionally,
it presents theoretical propositions demonstrating the positive effect of using
multimodal data and modern foundational models in 3D mapping methods. Details

Conclusion: RDR框架有效提升了多模态大语言模型在视觉退化科学图表上的鲁棒性，为解决实际科学应用中视觉扰动问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants (LVLMs) hold
immense promise for scientific and engineering applications, particularly in
processing visual information like scientific diagrams. However, their
practical deployment is hindered by a critical lack of robustness to common
visual perturbations such as noise, blur, and occlusions, which are prevalent
in real-world scientific documents. Existing evaluation benchmarks largely
overlook this challenge, leaving the robust reasoning capabilities of LVLMs on
visually degraded scientific diagrams underexplored. To address this, we
introduce the Robust Diagram Reasoning (RDR) framework, a novel approach
designed to enhance and rigorously evaluate LVLMs' performance under such
conditions. At its core, RDR employs an Adaptive Multi-View & Consistency
Verification (AMCV) mechanism, which involves generating multiple perturbed
versions of a diagram, performing parallel inference, and then applying a
consistency-based self-correction loop. We also propose two new metrics,
Perturbation Robustness Score (PRS) and Visual Degradation Consistency (VDC),
to quantify robustness. Furthermore, we construct SciDiagram-Robust, the first
large-scale scientific diagram question-answering dataset specifically
augmented with diverse, programmatically generated visual perturbations. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art closed-source
LVLMs like GPT-4V exhibit significant performance degradation when faced with
perturbed inputs (Clean Accuracy 85.2% vs. PRS 72.1%).

Conclusion: DeltaFlow通过高效的时序信息利用和创新的损失函数设计，在场景流估计任务中实现了优异的性能和效率平衡，代码和模型权重已开源。

Abstract: Previous dominant methods for scene flow estimation focus mainly on input
from two consecutive frames, neglecting valuable information in the temporal
domain. While recent trends shift towards multi-frame reasoning, they suffer
from rapidly escalating computational costs as the number of frames grows. To
leverage temporal information more efficiently, we propose DeltaFlow
($\Delta$Flow), a lightweight 3D framework that captures motion cues via a
$\Delta$ scheme, extracting temporal features with minimal computational cost,
regardless of the number of frames. Additionally, scene flow estimation faces
challenges such as imbalanced object class distributions and motion
inconsistency. To tackle these issues, we introduce a Category-Balanced Loss to
enhance learning across underrepresented classes and an Instance Consistency
Loss to enforce coherent object motion, improving flow accuracy. Extensive
evaluations on the Argoverse 2 and Waymo datasets show that $\Delta$Flow
achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 22% lower error and $2\times$
faster inference compared to the next-best multi-frame supervised method, while
also demonstrating a strong cross-domain generalization ability. The code is

Abstract: Regression is fundamental in computer vision and is widely used in various
tasks including age estimation, depth estimation, target localization, \etc
However, real-world data often exhibits imbalanced distribution, making
regression models perform poorly especially for target values with rare
observations~(known as the imbalanced regression problem). In this paper, we
reframe imbalanced regression as an imbalanced generalization problem. To
tackle that, we look into the loss sharpness property for measuring the
generalization ability of regression models in the observation space. Namely,
given a certain perturbation on the model parameters, we check how model
performance changes according to the loss values of different target
observations. We propose a simple yet effective approach called Balanced
Sharpness-Aware Minimization~(BSAM) to enforce the uniform generalization
ability of regression models for the entire observation space. In particular,
we start from the traditional sharpness-aware minimization and then introduce a
novel targeted reweighting strategy to homogenize the generalization ability

*Yuzhi Lai,Shenghai Yuan,Peizheng Li,Jun Lou,Andreas Zell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEER-VAR是一个创新的车载AR框架，通过语义分解、上下文感知SLAM分支和LLM驱动的推荐系统，实现了动态的车内外场景分离和智能AR叠加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AR系统通常假设静态或单视角设置，无法有效处理驾驶场景中动态变化的车内外环境。需要一种能够智能识别不同场景上下文并提供相关AR信息的系统。

Method: 使用深度引导的视觉-语言基础进行车舱和道路场景的动态分离，采用两个SLAM分支分别跟踪不同上下文的自我运动，并基于GPT的模块生成上下文感知的AR叠加（如仪表盘提示和危险警报）。

Result: 实验表明SEER-VAR在各种环境中实现了稳健的空间对齐和感知一致的AR渲染，提高了场景理解、叠加相关性和驾驶员便利性。

Conclusion: 该框架为基于LLM的AR推荐在自我中心驾驶中的应用提供了有效基础，是这一研究方向的重要探索，代码和数据集将开源。

Abstract: We present SEER-VAR, a novel framework for egocentric vehicle-based augmented
reality (AR) that unifies semantic decomposition, Context-Aware SLAM Branches
(CASB), and LLM-driven recommendation. Unlike existing systems that assume
static or single-view settings, SEER-VAR dynamically separates cabin and road
scenes via depth-guided vision-language grounding. Two SLAM branches track
egocentric motion in each context, while a GPT-based module generates
context-aware overlays such as dashboard cues and hazard alerts. To support
evaluation, we introduce EgoSLAM-Drive, a real-world dataset featuring
synchronized egocentric views, 6DoF ground-truth poses, and AR annotations
across diverse driving scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that SEER-VAR
achieves robust spatial alignment and perceptually coherent AR rendering across
varied environments. As one of the first to explore LLM-based AR recommendation
in egocentric driving, we address the lack of comparable systems through
structured prompting and detailed user studies. Results show that SEER-VAR
enhances perceived scene understanding, overlay relevance, and driver ease,
providing an effective foundation for future research in this direction. Code
and dataset will be made open source.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HCG-LVLM是一种新颖的分层架构，通过模仿人类从粗到细的认知处理方式，解决了现有视觉语言大模型在精确图像区域定位和细粒度视觉推理方面的不足，显著提高了准确性和减少了幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言大模型在复杂现实场景中表现出鲁棒性不足、容易产生幻觉和推理错误的问题，特别是在需要精确图像区域定位和细粒度视觉推理的任务中。

Method: 提出HCG-LVLM架构，采用两层处理：全局上下文感知层用于初步广泛理解，细粒度局部定位层包含局部细节增强模块提取高分辨率特征和语义一致性验证器确保准确的视觉语言对齐，通过自适应融合机制整合两层信息。

Conclusion: 分层设计有效增强了细粒度视觉语言理解和精确定位能力，验证了从粗到细认知处理方式在提升模型性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in natural language processing and multimodal
understanding. Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, current
LVLMs often exhibit insufficient robustness, proneness to hallucination, and
reasoning errors in complex real-world scenarios, particularly when precise
image region localization and fine-grained visual reasoning are required. To
address these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical Contextual Grounding
LVLM (HCG-LVLM), a novel architecture that mimics human coarse-to-fine
cognitive processing. HCG-LVLM employs a two-layered approach: a Global
Contextual Perception layer for initial broad understanding and a Fine-grained
Local Grounding layer. The latter incorporates a Local Detail Enhancement
Module to extract high-resolution features and a Semantic Consistency Validator
to ensure accurate, hallucination-free visual-language alignment. Through an
adaptive fusion mechanism, information from both layers is integrated for
robust and precise outputs. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets,
including GQA, A-OKVQA for fine-grained VQA, and RefCOCO/+/g for Referring
Expression Comprehension, demonstrate that HCG-LVLM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models such as Flamingo, BLIP-2, and MiniGPT-4. Our model
achieves superior accuracy and significantly reduces hallucination, validating
the effectiveness of its hierarchical design in enhancing fine-grained
visual-language understanding and precise grounding capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于旋转分解和分支界定搜索的高效点云注册方法，通过将刚体变换分解为沿轴平移和2D变换，使用扫描线算法高效求解几何重叠问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的点云注册方法在高离群率情况下存在问题：图形方法需要二次方空间和时间复杂度，而多阶段分支界定搜索方法容易困于局部最优解

Method: 使用Chasles定理将刚体变换分解为沿轴平移和2D刚体变换，通过分支界定搜索找最优旋转轴和角度，并使用扫描线算法和段树高效求解范围最大查询问题

Result: 在3DMatch、3DLoMatch和KITTI数据集上表现出超越当前最先进方法的精度和效率，时间复杂度为多项式，空间复杂度与点数成线性关系

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种时空复杂度更优的点云注册解决方案，能够在高离群率环境下绝对准确地找到全局最优变换，而不会困于局部最优解

Abstract: Point cloud registration based on correspondences computes the rigid
transformation that maximizes the number of inliers constrained within the
noise threshold. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employing spatial
compatibility graphs or branch-and-bound (BnB) search mainly focus on
registration under high outlier ratios. However, graph-based methods require at
least quadratic space and time complexity for graph construction, while
multi-stage BnB search methods often suffer from inaccuracy due to local optima
between decomposed stages. This paper proposes a geometric maximum overlapping
registration framework via rotation-only BnB search. The rigid transformation
is decomposed using Chasles' theorem into a translation along rotation axis and
a 2D rigid transformation. The optimal rotation axis and angle are searched via
BnB, with residual parameters formulated as range maximum query (RMQ) problems.
Firstly, the top-k candidate rotation axes are searched within a hemisphere
parameterized by cube mapping, and the translation along each axis is estimated
through interval stabbing of the correspondences projected onto that axis.
Secondly, the 2D registration is relaxed to 1D rotation angle search with 2D
RMQ of geometric overlapping for axis-aligned rectangles, which is solved
deterministically in polynomial time using sweep line algorithm with segment
tree. Experimental results on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and KITTI datasets
demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency over SOTA methods, while the time
complexity is polynomial and the space complexity increases linearly with the
number of points, even in the worst case.

irrespective of their realness. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art results
on the test dataset to meticulously detect Deepfake images.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenges of data scarcity and high acquisition
costs for training robust object detection models in complex industrial
environments, such as offshore oil platforms. The practical and economic
barriers to collecting real-world data in these hazardous settings often hamper
the development of autonomous inspection systems. To overcome this, in this
work we propose and validate a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that combines
procedural rendering with AI-driven video generation. Our methodology leverages
BlenderProc to create photorealistic images with precise annotations and
controlled domain randomization, and integrates NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2
world-foundation model to synthesize physically plausible video sequences with
temporal diversity, capturing rare viewpoints and adverse conditions. We
demonstrate that a YOLO-based detection network trained on a composite dataset,
blending real images with our synthetic data, achieves superior performance
compared to models trained exclusively on real-world data. Notably, a 1:1
mixture of real and synthetic data yielded the highest accuracy, surpassing the
real-only baseline. These findings highlight the viability of a synthetic-first
approach as an efficient, cost-effective, and safe alternative for developing
reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained
industrial applications.

Motivation: 解决全参数微调会损害预训练模型固有泛化能力的问题，寻求在任务适应和泛化保持之间的平衡

Method: 使用双操作符选择机制识别和更新在所有源域中表现出一致且显著梯度的参数，限制只更新稀疏参数子集

Result: 在基准测试中优于最先进的领域泛化方法，证明了方法的效率和有效性

Conclusion: JPS通过选择性参数更新成功保留了预训练模型的泛化优势，理论分析和实验结果都验证了该方法的优越性

Abstract: Domain generalization seeks to develop models trained on a limited set of
source domains that are capable of generalizing effectively to unseen target
domains. While the predominant approach leverages large-scale pre-trained
vision models as initialization, recent studies have highlighted that full
fine-tuning can compromise the intrinsic generalization capabilities of these
models. To address this limitation, parameter-efficient adaptation strategies
have emerged, wherein only a subset of model parameters is selectively
fine-tuned, thereby balancing task adaptation with the preservation of
generalization. Motivated by this paradigm, we introduce Joint Parameter
Selection (JPS), a novel method that restricts updates to a small, sparse
subset of parameters, thereby retaining and harnessing the generalization
strength of pre-trained models. Theoretically, we establish a generalization
error bound that explicitly accounts for the sparsity of parameter updates,
thereby providing a principled justification for selective fine-tuning.
Practically, we design a selection mechanism employing dual operators to
identify and update parameters exhibiting consistent and significant gradients
across all source domains. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that JPS
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art domain
generalization methods, substantiating both the efficiency and efficacy of the
proposed approach.

Method: 利用扩散变换器中特征导数近似呈现多元高斯特性的洞察，采用Hermite多项式作为理论最优基函数，并引入对偶缩放机制确保数值稳定性

Conclusion: HiCache通过理论对齐和经验特性的结合，为扩散模型提供了高效且质量保持的推理加速解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but
suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. While
recent feature caching methods tend to accelerate inference through temporal
extrapolation, these methods still suffer from server quality loss due to the
failure in modeling the complex dynamics of feature evolution. To solve this
problem, this paper presents HiCache, a training-free acceleration framework
that fundamentally improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools
with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature derivative
approximations in Diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian
characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials-the potentially
theoretically optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. Besides, We
further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability
while preserving predictive accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate
HiCache's superiority: achieving 6.24x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while exceeding
baseline quality, maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video
generation, and super-resolution tasks. Core implementation is provided in the
appendix, with complete code to be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Proper segmentation of organs-at-risk is important for radiation therapy,
surgical planning, and diagnostic decision-making in medical image analysis.
While deep learning-based segmentation architectures have made significant
progress, they often fail to balance segmentation accuracy with computational
efficiency. Most of the current state-of-the-art methods either prioritize
performance at the cost of high computational complexity or compromise accuracy
for efficiency. This paper addresses this gap by introducing an efficient
dual-line decoder segmentation network (EDLDNet). The proposed method features
a noisy decoder, which learns to incorporate structured perturbation at
training time for better model robustness, yet at inference time only the
noise-free decoder is executed, leading to lower computational cost.
Multi-Scale convolutional Attention Modules (MSCAMs), Attention Gates (AGs),
and Up-Convolution Blocks (UCBs) are further utilized to optimize feature
representation and boost segmentation performance. By leveraging multi-scale
segmentation masks from both decoders, we also utilize a mutation-based loss
function to enhance the model's generalization. Our approach outperforms SOTA
segmentation architectures on four publicly available medical imaging datasets.
EDLDNet achieves SOTA performance with an 84.00% Dice score on the Synapse
dataset, surpassing baseline model like UNet by 13.89% in Dice score while
significantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) by 89.7%. Compared
to recent approaches like EMCAD, our EDLDNet not only achieves higher Dice
score but also maintains comparable computational efficiency. The outstanding
performance across diverse datasets establishes EDLDNet's strong
generalization, computational efficiency, and robustness. The source code,
pre-processed data, and pre-trained weights will be available at

Motivation: 现有的弱监督语义分割方法过于强调类间分离，往往忽略了相关类别间的共享语义，并且缺乏细粒度的区分能力。

Method: CPC框架：1) 利用大语言模型推导编码内在类间关系的类别簇；2) 引入类感知的patch级对比损失来强制类内一致性和类间分离；3) 分层设计利用簇作为粗粒度语义先验同时保持细粒度边界。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2012和MS COCO 2014数据集上的实验表明，CPC超越了现有的state-of-the-art弱监督语义分割方法。

Conclusion: CPC通过结合大语言模型和对比学习，有效解决了弱监督语义分割中类间关系建模和细粒度区分的问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels has
gained attention for its cost-effectiveness. Most existing methods emphasize
inter-class separation, often neglecting the shared semantics among related
categories and lacking fine-grained discrimination. To address this, we propose
Contrastive Prompt Clustering (CPC), a novel WSSS framework. CPC exploits Large
Language Models (LLMs) to derive category clusters that encode intrinsic
inter-class relationships, and further introduces a class-aware patch-level
contrastive loss to enforce intra-class consistency and inter-class separation.
This hierarchical design leverages clusters as coarse-grained semantic priors
while preserving fine-grained boundaries, thereby reducing confusion among
visually similar categories. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014
demonstrate that CPC surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in WSSS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型手写文本生成方法容易记忆训练样本，在风格变化和生成清晰度方面表现不佳，特别是对于困难风格会产生伪影和失真

Method: DOG策略利用负向扰动提示的正交投影来引导生成，避免伪影同时保持内容一致性，并采用三角调度控制去噪过程中的引导强度

Result: 在DiffusionPen和One-DM上的实验表明，DOG提高了内容清晰度和风格可变性，即使对于词汇外单词和挑战性书写风格也有效

Conclusion: DOG提供了一种更稳定、解耦的潜在空间引导方向，相比标准CFG方法能产生更多样化且合理的输出

Abstract: Diffusion-based Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) approaches achieve
impressive results on frequent, in-vocabulary words observed at training time
and on regular styles. However, they are prone to memorizing training samples
and often struggle with style variability and generation clarity. In
particular, standard diffusion models tend to produce artifacts or distortions
that negatively affect the readability of the generated text, especially when
the style is hard to produce. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel
sampling guidance strategy, Dual Orthogonal Guidance (DOG), that leverages an
orthogonal projection of a negatively perturbed prompt onto the original
positive prompt. This approach helps steer the generation away from artifacts
while maintaining the intended content, and encourages more diverse, yet
plausible, outputs. Unlike standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which
relies on unconditional predictions and produces noise at high guidance scales,
DOG introduces a more stable, disentangled direction in the latent space. To
control the strength of the guidance across the denoising process, we apply a
triangular schedule: weak at the start and end of denoising, when the process
is most sensitive, and strongest in the middle steps. Experimental results on
the state-of-the-art DiffusionPen and One-DM demonstrate that DOG improves both
content clarity and style variability, even for out-of-vocabulary words and
challenging writing styles.

Abstract: As a critical task in video sequence classification within computer vision,
Online Action Detection (OAD) has garnered significant attention. The
sensitivity of mainstream OAD models to varying video viewpoints often hampers
their generalization when confronted with unseen sources. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention (PTMA)
model, which leverages probabilistic modeling to derive latent compressed
representations of video frames in a cross-view setting. The PTMA model
incorporates a GRU-based temporal masked attention (TMA) cell, which leverages
these representations to effectively query the input video sequence, thereby
enhancing information interaction and facilitating autoregressive frame-level
video analysis. Additionally, multi-view information can be integrated into the
probabilistic modeling to facilitate the extraction of view-invariant features.
Experiments conducted under three evaluation protocols: cross-subject (cs),
cross-view (cv), and cross-subject-view (csv) show that PTMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the DAHLIA, IKEA ASM, and Breakfast datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法为跨域深度伪造检测设立了新的基准，通过关注局部判别特征有效解决了现有方法的泛化问题。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deepfake generation techniques has intensified the
need for robust and generalizable detection methods. Existing approaches based
on reconstruction learning typically leverage deep convolutional networks to
extract differential features. However, these methods show poor generalization
across object categories (e.g., from faces to cars) and generation domains
(e.g., from GANs to Stable Diffusion), due to intrinsic limitations of deep
CNNs. First, models trained on a specific category tend to overfit to semantic
feature distributions, making them less transferable to other categories,
especially as network depth increases. Second, Global Average Pooling (GAP)
compresses critical local forgery cues into a single vector, thus discarding
discriminative patterns vital for real-fake classification. To address these
issues, we propose a novel Local Focus Mechanism (LFM) that explicitly attends
to discriminative local features for differentiating fake from real images. LFM
integrates a Salience Network (SNet) with a task-specific Top-K Pooling (TKP)
module to select the K most informative local patterns. To mitigate potential
overfitting introduced by Top-K pooling, we introduce two regularization
techniques: Rank-Based Linear Dropout (RBLD) and Random-K Sampling (RKS), which
enhance the model's robustness. LFM achieves a 3.7 improvement in accuracy and
a 2.8 increase in average precision over the state-of-the-art Neighboring Pixel
Relationships (NPR) method, while maintaining exceptional efficiency at 1789
FPS on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU. Our approach sets a new benchmark for
cross-domain deepfake detection. The source code are available in

Abstract: The proliferation of digital food content has intensified the need for robust
and accurate systems capable of fine-grained visual understanding and
retrieval. In this work, we address the challenging task of food image-to-text
matching, a critical component in applications such as dietary monitoring,
smart kitchens, and restaurant automation. We propose F4-ITS: Fine-grained
Feature Fusion for Food Image-Text Search, a training-free, vision-language
model (VLM)-guided framework that significantly improves retrieval performance
through enhanced multi-modal feature representations. Our approach introduces
two key contributions: (1) a uni-directional(and bi-directional) multi-modal
fusion strategy that combines image embeddings with VLM-generated textual
descriptions to improve query expressiveness, and (2) a novel feature-based
re-ranking mechanism for top-k retrieval, leveraging predicted food ingredients
to refine results and boost precision. Leveraging open-source image-text
encoders, we demonstrate substantial gains over standard baselines - achieving
~10% and ~7.7% improvements in top-1 retrieval under dense and sparse caption
scenarios, and a ~28.6% gain in top-k ingredient-level retrieval. Additionally,
we show that smaller models (e.g., ViT-B/32) can match or outperform larger
counterparts (e.g., ViT-H, ViT-G, ViT-bigG) when augmented with textual fusion,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: We present StyleClone, a method for training image-to-image translation
networks to stylize faces in a specific style, even with limited style images.
Our approach leverages textual inversion and diffusion-based guided image
generation to augment small style datasets. By systematically generating
diverse style samples guided by both the original style images and real face
images, we significantly enhance the diversity of the style dataset. Using this
augmented dataset, we train fast image-to-image translation networks that
outperform diffusion-based methods in speed and quality. Experiments on
multiple styles demonstrate that our method improves stylization quality,
better preserves source image content, and significantly accelerates inference.
Additionally, we provide a systematic evaluation of the augmentation techniques

Motivation: 室外3D场景理解依赖高质量点云，但LiDAR扫描数据通常极其稀疏，现有上采样方法主要针对单个物体，在复杂室外场景泛化能力有限

Method: 采用无分类器引导的DDPM扩散模型，以稀疏点云为条件引导，附近帧合成点云为输入；设计体素补全模块精炼特征，点-体素交互模块整合特征

Conclusion: PVNet通过扩散模型和点-体素交互有效解决了室外场景点云稀疏问题，显著提升了下游3D感知任务的性能

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene understanding in outdoor environments heavily relies on
high-quality point clouds. However, LiDAR-scanned data often suffer from
extreme sparsity, severely hindering downstream 3D perception tasks. Existing
point cloud upsampling methods primarily focus on individual objects, thus
demonstrating limited generalization capability for complex outdoor scenes. To
address this issue, we propose PVNet, a diffusion model-based point-voxel
interaction framework to perform LiDAR point cloud upsampling without dense
supervision. Specifically, we adopt the classifier-free guidance-based DDPMs to
guide the generation, in which we employ a sparse point cloud as the guiding
condition and the synthesized point clouds derived from its nearby frames as
the input. Moreover, we design a voxel completion module to refine and complete
the coarse voxel features for enriching the feature representation. In
addition, we propose a point-voxel interaction module to integrate features
from both points and voxels, which efficiently improves the environmental
perception capability of each upsampled point. To the best of our knowledge,
our approach is the first scene-level point cloud upsampling method supporting
arbitrary upsampling rates. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source
code will be available at https://github.com/chengxianjing/PVNet.

Motivation: 解决实时游戏中质量与性能的交换问题，实现动态环境下的真实照相效果

Method: 提出REGEN双阶段生成对抗网络框架，先用稳健的非配对图像转换模型生成语义一致的真实帧，再转换为简化的配对图像转换任务，使用轻量方法进行训练

Result: 在GTA V中验证，视觉效果与稳健非配对方法相当，推理速度提升32.14倍，效果超过直接训练轻量非配对方法

Conclusion: REGEN框架能够在保持高质量照相效果的同时实现实时性，为游戏图形渲染提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Photorealism is an important aspect of modern video games since it can shape
the player experience and simultaneously impact the immersion, narrative
engagement, and visual fidelity. Although recent hardware technological
breakthroughs, along with state-of-the-art rendering technologies, have
significantly improved the visual realism of video games, achieving true
photorealism in dynamic environments at real-time frame rates still remains a
major challenge due to the tradeoff between visual quality and performance. In
this short paper, we present a novel approach for enhancing the photorealism of
rendered game frames using generative adversarial networks. To this end, we
propose Real-time photorealism Enhancement in Games via a dual-stage gEnerative
Network framework (REGEN), which employs a robust unpaired image-to-image
translation model to produce semantically consistent photorealistic frames that
transform the problem into a simpler paired image-to-image translation task.
This enables training with a lightweight method that can achieve real-time
inference time without compromising visual quality. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework on Grand Theft Auto V, showing that the approach
achieves visual results comparable to the ones produced by the robust unpaired
Im2Im method while improving inference speed by 32.14 times. Our findings also
indicate that the results outperform the photorealism-enhanced frames produced
by directly training a lightweight unpaired Im2Im translation method to
translate the video game frames towards the visual characteristics of
real-world images. Code, pre-trained models, and demos for this work are

TL;DR: SSG-DiT是一个新颖的可控视频生成框架，通过空间信号引导和双阶段解耦设计，显著提升了生成视频与文本提示的语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控视频生成模型在保持语义一致性方面存在挑战，经常生成偏离提示细节的视频内容，需要解决这一关键问题。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1) 空间信号提示阶段利用预训练多模态模型生成空间感知视觉提示；2) 通过轻量级SSG-Adapter将联合条件注入冻结的视频DiT骨干网络，采用双分支注意力机制。

Result: 在VBench基准测试中达到最先进性能，在空间关系控制和整体一致性等关键指标上超越现有模型。

Conclusion: SSG-DiT框架通过空间信号引导和高效适配器设计，成功解决了可控视频生成中的语义一致性问题，为高质量视频合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Controllable video generation aims to synthesize video content that aligns
precisely with user-provided conditions, such as text descriptions and initial
images. However, a significant challenge persists in this domain: existing
models often struggle to maintain strong semantic consistency, frequently
generating videos that deviate from the nuanced details specified in the
prompts. To address this issue, we propose SSG-DiT (Spatial Signal Guided
Diffusion Transformer), a novel and efficient framework for high-fidelity
controllable video generation. Our approach introduces a decoupled two-stage
process. The first stage, Spatial Signal Prompting, generates a spatially aware
visual prompt by leveraging the rich internal representations of a pre-trained
multi-modal model. This prompt, combined with the original text, forms a joint
condition that is then injected into a frozen video DiT backbone via our
lightweight and parameter-efficient SSG-Adapter. This unique design, featuring
a dual-branch attention mechanism, allows the model to simultaneously harness
its powerful generative priors while being precisely steered by external
spatial signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSG-DiT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models on multiple key
metrics in the VBench benchmark, particularly in spatial relationship control
and overall consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将Vision Transformer与近端工具相结合的新框架，通过几何优化方法增强特征表示和分类性能，在分类准确率和数据分布方面优于传统ViT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ViT的优化局限于建模单个图像内的局部关系，无法捕捉数据点之间的全局几何关系，需要解决这一局限性。

Method: 集成ViT与近端工具的统一几何优化框架：ViT通过自注意力机制构建流形的切丛（每个注意力头对应一个切空间），然后引入近端迭代定义切丛中的截面并将数据从切空间投影到基空间。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法在分类准确率和数据分布方面优于传统ViT。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了全局特征对齐和优化，为ViT提供了更好的几何表示能力。

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture has become widely recognized in
computer vision, leveraging its self-attention mechanism to achieve remarkable
success across various tasks. Despite its strengths, ViT's optimization remains
confined to modeling local relationships within individual images, limiting its
ability to capture the global geometric relationships between data points. To
address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework that integrates
ViT with the proximal tools, enabling a unified geometric optimization approach
to enhance feature representation and classification performance. In this
framework, ViT constructs the tangent bundle of the manifold through its
self-attention mechanism, where each attention head corresponds to a tangent
space, offering geometric representations from diverse local perspectives.
Proximal iterations are then introduced to define sections within the tangent
bundle and project data from tangent spaces onto the base space, achieving
global feature alignment and optimization. Experimental results confirm that
the proposed method outperforms traditional ViT in terms of classification
accuracy and data distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度度量学习方法存在采样复杂、收敛慢或无法优化全局分布的问题，需要一种既高效又能优化分布可分离性的方法

Method: 提出Proxy-Decidability Loss，通过可学习代理估计真实分布和冒名分布，结合可分离性指数(d')统计框架来优化嵌入空间

Result: 在细粒度分类和人脸验证等任务上达到与最先进方法相当的性能，同时提供了嵌入优化的新视角

Conclusion: PD-Loss成功地将代理方法的计算效率与基于统计的可分离性优化相结合，为分布感知的深度度量学习提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Deep Metric Learning (DML) aims to learn embedding functions that map
semantically similar inputs to proximate points in a metric space while
separating dissimilar ones. Existing methods, such as pairwise losses, are
hindered by complex sampling requirements and slow convergence. In contrast,
proxy-based losses, despite their improved scalability, often fail to optimize
global distribution properties. The Decidability-based Loss (D-Loss) addresses
this by targeting the decidability index (d') to enhance distribution
separability, but its reliance on large mini-batches imposes significant
computational constraints. We introduce Proxy-Decidability Loss (PD-Loss), a
novel objective that integrates learnable proxies with the statistical
framework of d' to optimize embedding spaces efficiently. By estimating genuine
and impostor distributions through proxies, PD-Loss combines the computational
efficiency of proxy-based methods with the principled separability of D-Loss,
offering a scalable approach to distribution-aware DML. Experiments across
various tasks, including fine-grained classification and face verification,
demonstrate that PD-Loss achieves performance comparable to that of
state-of-the-art methods while introducing a new perspective on embedding
optimization, with potential for broader applications.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的MLLM系统需要密集像素监督进行训练，成本高昂且在域外数据上表现较弱。需要一种能够利用基础模型强先验、最小化可训练参数，并能从廉价标注中学习的方法。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型生成任务相关的边界框和正点，然后将其作为提示传递给预训练的分割模型生成最终掩码。完全使用强化学习（GRPO）进行优化，仅使用格式奖励和准确性奖励（无掩码监督）。

Result: 在域内测试集上提升约4%，在域外基准测试上提升高达54%，证明了模型的鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: 复杂的地理空间分割行为可以通过强化学习从弱空间线索中学习，该方法利用了基础模型的强先验，最小化了可训练参数，并能从廉价标注中学习。

Abstract: Geospatial pixel reasoning is a nascent remote-sensing task that aims to
generate segmentation masks directly from natural-language instructions.
Prevailing MLLM-based systems co-train a language model and a mask decoder with
dense pixel supervision, which is expensive and often weak on out-of-domain
(OOD) data. We introduce GRASP, a structured policy-learning framework. In our
design, a multimodal large language model first emits task-relevant bounding
boxes and positive points from a vision-language instruction. These outputs are
then passed to a pre-trained segmentation model, which consumes them as prompts
to generate the final mask. Instead of supervised fine-tuning, we optimize the
system purely with reinforcement learning: the model is trained solely with
GRPO, guided by format rewards and accuracy rewards computed on boxes and
points (no mask supervision). This leverages strong priors in foundation
models, minimizes trainable parameters, and enables learning from inexpensive
annotations. We additionally curate GRASP-1k, which contains
reasoning-intensive queries, detailed reasoning traces, and fine-grained
segmentation annotations. Evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain test
sets show state-of-the-art results: about 4% improvement in-domain and up to
54% on OOD benchmarks. The experiment results evidence our model's robust
generalization and demonstrate that complex geospatial segmentation behaviors
can be learned via RL from weak spatial cues. Code and the dataset will be
released open-source.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了多样化的基准数据集、适合低资源环境的高效模型以及实用的甘蔗病害分类工具，解决了现实田间条件下的诊断挑战

Abstract: Despite progress in AI-based plant diagnostics, sugarcane farmers in
low-resource regions remain vulnerable to leaf diseases due to the lack of
scalable, efficient, and interpretable tools. Many deep learning models fail to
generalize under real-world conditions and require substantial computational
resources, limiting their use in resource-constrained regions. In this paper,
we present SugarcaneLD-BD, a curated dataset for sugarcane leaf-disease
classification; SugarcaneShuffleNet, an optimized lightweight model for rapid
on-device diagnosis; and SugarcaneAI, a Progressive Web Application for field
deployment. SugarcaneLD-BD contains 638 curated images across five classes,
including four major sugarcane diseases, collected in Bangladesh under diverse
field conditions and verified by expert pathologists. To enhance diversity, we
combined SugarcaneLD-BD with two additional datasets, yielding a larger and
more representative corpus. Our optimized model, SugarcaneShuffleNet, offers
the best trade-off between speed and accuracy for real-time, on-device
diagnosis. This 9.26 MB model achieved 98.02% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.98,
and an average inference time of 4.14 ms per image. For comparison, we
fine-tuned five other lightweight convolutional neural networks: MnasNet,
EdgeNeXt, EfficientNet-Lite, MobileNet, and SqueezeNet via transfer learning
and Bayesian optimization. MnasNet and EdgeNeXt achieved comparable accuracy to
SugarcaneShuffleNet, but required significantly more parameters, memory, and
computation, limiting their suitability for low-resource deployment. We
integrate SugarcaneShuffleNet into SugarcaneAI, delivering Grad-CAM-based
explanations in the field. Together, these contributions offer a diverse
benchmark, efficient models for low-resource environments, and a practical tool
for sugarcane disease classification. It spans varied lighting, backgrounds and
devices used on-farm

Method: 提出四核心创新：(1)平滑边界CNN集成Transformer(SBCIT)；(2)定制残差空间学习CNN；(3)通道增强策略；(4)新型空间注意力机制。使用stem卷积和上下文交互transformer块进行全局特征建模。

Result: 在Kaggle和Figshare的MRI数据集（包含胶质瘤、脑膜瘤、垂体瘤和健康对照）上评估，达到98.30%准确率、98.08%灵敏度、98.25% F1分数和98.43%精确度。

Conclusion: CE-RS-SBCIT框架通过整合局部细粒度和全局上下文线索，有效解决了脑肿瘤MRI分类中的挑战，表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Brain tumors remain among the most lethal human diseases, where early
detection and accurate classification are critical for effective diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although deep learning-based computer-aided diagnostic
(CADx) systems have shown remarkable progress. However, conventional
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers face persistent
challenges, including high computational cost, sensitivity to minor contrast
variations, structural heterogeneity, and texture inconsistencies in MRI data.
Therefore, a novel hybrid framework, CE-RS-SBCIT, is introduced, integrating
residual and spatial learning-based CNNs with transformer-driven modules. The
proposed framework exploits local fine-grained and global contextual cues
through four core innovations: (i) a smoothing and boundary-based
CNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), (ii) tailored residual and spatial learning
CNNs, (iii) a channel enhancement (CE) strategy, and (iv) a novel spatial
attention mechanism. The developed SBCIT employs stem convolution and
contextual interaction transformer blocks with systematic smoothing and
boundary operations, enabling efficient global feature modeling. Moreover,
Residual and spatial CNNs, enhanced by auxiliary transfer-learned feature maps,
enrich the representation space, while the CE module amplifies discriminative
channels and mitigates redundancy. Furthermore, the spatial attention mechanism
selectively emphasizes subtle contrast and textural variations across tumor
classes. Extensive evaluation on challenging MRI datasets from Kaggle and
Figshare, encompassing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and healthy
controls, demonstrates superior performance, achieving 98.30% accuracy, 98.08%
sensitivity, 98.25% F1-score, and 98.43% precision.

Abstract: Traditional video-based learning remains passive, offering limited
opportunities for users to engage dynamically with content. While current
AI-powered tools offer transcription and summarization, they lack real-time,
region-specific interaction capabilities. This paper introduces Untwist, an
AI-driven system that enables interactive video learning by allowing users to
ask questions about the entire video or specific regions using a bounding box,
receiving context-aware, multimodal responses. By integrating GPT APIs with
Computer Vision techniques, Untwist extracts, processes, and structures video
content to enhance comprehension. Our approach addresses GPT-4o spatial
weakness by leveraging annotated frames instead of raw coordinate data,
significantly improving accuracy in localizing and interpreting video content.
This paper describes the system architecture, including video pre-processing
and real-time interaction, and outlines how Untwist can transform passive video
consumption into an interactive, AI-driven learning experience with the
potential to enhance engagement and comprehension.

Result: 在独立测试集中，使用各向同性模型提取的皮质亚区厚度在区分轻度认知障碍和认知正常参与者方面比各向异性方法显示出更高的显著性；在纵向分析中，各向同性方法提取的生物标志物在认知正常参与者中表现出更好的稳定性

Conclusion: 本研究在不增加图谱标注工作量的情况下提高了AD成像生物标志物的准确性，有助于更准确地量化AD与脑萎缩的关系，为疾病追踪提供更精确的测量方法

Abstract: Imaging biomarkers in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are important tools
for diagnosing and tracking Alzheimer's disease (AD). As medial temporal lobe
(MTL) is the earliest region to show AD-related hallmarks, brain atrophy caused
by AD can first be observed in the MTL. Accurate segmentation of MTL subregions
and extraction of imaging biomarkers from them are important. However, due to
imaging limitations, the resolution of T2-weighted (T2w) MRI is anisotropic,
which makes it difficult to accurately extract the thickness of cortical
subregions in the MTL. In this study, we used an implicit neural representation
method to combine the resolution advantages of T1-weighted and T2w MRI to
accurately upsample an MTL subregion atlas set from anisotropic space to
isotropic space, establishing a multi-modality, high-resolution atlas set.
Based on this atlas, we developed an isotropic MTL subregion segmentation
model. In an independent test set, the cortical subregion thickness extracted
using this isotropic model showed higher significance than an anisotropic
method in distinguishing between participants with mild cognitive impairment
and cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants. In longitudinal analysis, the
biomarkers extracted using isotropic method showed greater stability in CU
participants. This study improved the accuracy of AD imaging biomarkers without
increasing the amount of atlas annotation work, which may help to more
accurately quantify the relationship between AD and brain atrophy and provide
more accurate measures for disease tracking.

TL;DR: 提出AdvCP方法解决弱监督变化检测中的背景噪声问题，通过对抗提示挖掘和样本校正来提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督变化检测(WSCD)仅使用图像级标签，但容易将背景变化误判为目标变化，特别是在复杂遥感场景中

Method: AdvCP包含两个阶段：1)对抗提示挖掘-使用错误标签激活错误特征映射；2)对抗样本校正-构建在线全局原型整合样本

Result: 在ConvNet、Transformer和SAM基线上均显示显著性能提升，且可推广到其他多类弱监督密集预测场景

Conclusion: AdvCP能有效解决WSCD中的共现噪声问题，无需增加推理成本，具有良好泛化性

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Change Detection (WSCD) aims to distinguish specific object
changes (e.g., objects appearing or disappearing) from background variations
(e.g., environmental changes due to light, weather, or seasonal shifts) in
paired satellite images, relying only on paired image (i.e., image-level)
classification labels. This technique significantly reduces the need for dense
annotations required in fully-supervised change detection. However, as
image-level supervision only indicates whether objects have changed in a scene,
WSCD methods often misclassify background variations as object changes,
especially in complex remote-sensing scenarios. In this work, we propose an
Adversarial Class Prompting (AdvCP) method to address this co-occurring noise
problem, including two phases: a) Adversarial Prompt Mining: After each
training iteration, we introduce adversarial prompting perturbations, using
incorrect one-hot image-level labels to activate erroneous feature mappings.
This process reveals co-occurring adversarial samples under weak supervision,
namely background variation features that are likely to be misclassified as
object changes. b) Adversarial Sample Rectification: We integrate these
adversarially prompt-activated pixel samples into training by constructing an
online global prototype. This prototype is built from an exponentially weighted
moving average of the current batch and all historical training data. Our AdvCP
can be seamlessly integrated into current WSCD methods without adding
additional inference cost. Experiments on ConvNet, Transformer, and Segment
Anything Model (SAM)-based baselines demonstrate significant performance
enhancements. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of AdvCP to
other multi-class weakly-supervised dense prediction scenarios. Code is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的封面图像生成任务缺乏合适的数据集，需要一种低成本构建高质量多模态数据集的方法来解决这个问题。

Method: 采用多模态伪标注方法：收集包含多个图像和标题的文档，排除事实不一致的实例；基于黄金摘要对图像和标题分别进行排名；当图像及其对应标题在各自排名中均为第一时标注伪标签；移除包含直接图像引用的文档。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的多模态伪标注方法比仅考虑文本或仅考虑图像的伪标注方法构建的数据集更精确，生成的图像质量更高。

Conclusion: 多模态伪标注方法能够有效构建高质量的封面图像生成数据集，为从纯文本生成对应视觉内容提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel cover image generation task that produces
both a concise summary and a visually corresponding image from a given
text-only document. Because no existing datasets are available for this task,
we propose a multimodal pseudo-labeling method to construct high-quality
datasets at low cost. We first collect documents that contain multiple images
with their captions, and their summaries by excluding factually inconsistent
instances. Our approach selects one image from the multiple images accompanying
the documents. Using the gold summary, we independently rank both the images
and their captions. Then, we annotate a pseudo-label for an image when both the
image and its corresponding caption are ranked first in their respective
rankings. Finally, we remove documents that contain direct image references
within texts. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal
pseudo-labeling method constructs more precise datasets and generates higher
quality images than text- and image-only pseudo-labeling methods, which
consider captions and images separately. We release our code at:

Motivation: 传统高速公路监控系统在复杂环境条件下的感知能力有限，需要一种能够同时处理多个关键感知任务、平衡准确性和计算效率的解决方案。

Method: 使用大型通用视觉语言模型（如GPT-4o）生成任务特定的思维链提示，指导小型高效VLM（如Qwen2.5-VL-7B）对短视频进行推理，结合多模态数据（视频流和道路天气传感器数据）。

Conclusion: 该框架可轻松集成到现有交通摄像头系统中，特别适用于高风险农村地区，通过持续监控提供及时警报，即使在资源受限环境中也能增强态势感知能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a multi-agent framework for comprehensive highway scene
understanding, designed around a mixture-of-experts strategy. In this
framework, a large generic vision-language model (VLM), such as GPT-4o, is
contextualized with domain knowledge to generates task-specific
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts. These fine-grained prompts are then used to
guide a smaller, efficient VLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) in reasoning over short
videos, along with complementary modalities as applicable. The framework
simultaneously addresses multiple critical perception tasks, including weather
classification, pavement wetness assessment, and traffic congestion detection,
achieving robust multi-task reasoning while balancing accuracy and
computational efficiency. To support empirical validation, we curated three
specialized datasets aligned with these tasks. Notably, the pavement wetness
dataset is multimodal, combining video streams with road weather sensor data,
highlighting the benefits of multimodal reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistently strong performance across diverse traffic and
environmental conditions. From a deployment perspective, the framework can be
readily integrated with existing traffic camera systems and strategically
applied to high-risk rural locations, such as sharp curves, flood-prone
lowlands, or icy bridges. By continuously monitoring the targeted sites, the
system enhances situational awareness and delivers timely alerts, even in
resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: 该研究为解决多模态数据获取困难提供了有效方案，通过知识分解和蓬蓬技术在仅使用病理图像的情况下显著提升了生物标记物预测的准确性

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker prediction benefits from multi-modal data
fusion analysis. However, the simultaneous acquisition of multi-modal data,
such as genomic and pathological information, is often challenging due to cost
or technical limitations. To address this challenge, we propose an online
distillation approach based on Multi-modal Knowledge Decomposition (MKD) to
enhance IHC biomarker prediction in haematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained
histopathology images. This method leverages paired genomic-pathology data
during training while enabling inference using either pathology slides alone or
both modalities. Two teacher and one student models are developed to extract
modality-specific and modality-general features by minimizing the MKD loss. To
maintain the internal structural relationships between samples,
Similarity-preserving Knowledge Distillation (SKD) is applied. Additionally,
Collaborative Learning for Online Distillation (CLOD) facilitates mutual
learning between teacher and student models, encouraging diverse and
complementary learning dynamics. Experiments on the TCGA-BRCA and in-house QHSU
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in IHC
biomarker prediction using uni-modal data. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 注意力增强的CNN结合目标损失优化和预处理，能够提供高准确、高效的自动化ALL诊断工具，有助于加速临床诊断流程

Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a prevalent hematological malignancy in
both pediatric and adult populations. Early and accurate detection with precise
subtyping is essential for guiding therapy. Conventional workflows are complex,
time-consuming, and prone to human error. We present a deep learning framework
for automated ALL diagnosis from bone marrow smear images. The method combines
a robust preprocessing pipeline with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
standardize image quality and improve inference efficiency. As a key design, we
insert a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) block into a VGG19 backbone to model
long-range dependencies and contextual relationships among cellular features.
To mitigate class imbalance, we train with Focal Loss. Across evaluated
architectures, the enhanced VGG19+MHSA trained with Focal Loss achieves 99.25%
accuracy, surpassing a strong ResNet101 baseline (98.62%). These results
indicate that attention-augmented CNNs, coupled with targeted loss optimization
and preprocessing, yield more discriminative representations of leukemic cell
morphology. Our approach offers a highly accurate and computationally efficient
tool for automated ALL recognition and subtyping, with potential to accelerate
diagnostic workflows and support reliable decision-making in clinical settings.

Motivation: 现有的视觉预训练表示主要基于2D图像，忽略了世界的3D本质，但由于大规模3D数据的稀缺性，难以从网络数据集中提取通用3D表示。

Method: FVP将视觉预训练目标构建为下一个点云预测问题，使用扩散模型作为预测模型，直接在大型公共数据集上进行预训练。

Result: 在12个真实世界操作任务中，FVP将3D扩散策略(DP3)的平均成功率提升28%，达到模仿学习方法中的最先进性能，并能适应不同的点云编码器和数据集。

Conclusion: FVP是一个有效的4D视觉预训练框架，能够显著提升3D表示的性能，在机器人学习任务中展现出强大的泛化能力和适应性。

Abstract: General visual representations learned from web-scale datasets for robotics
have achieved great success in recent years, enabling data-efficient robot
learning on manipulation tasks; yet these pre-trained representations are
mostly on 2D images, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the world. However,
due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a
universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a
general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations
as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training
framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training
objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model
as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets
directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average
success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP
pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning
methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud
encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger
Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various
robot tasks. Our project page is available at: https://4d-

TL;DR: PersPose是一个新的单目3D人体姿态估计框架，通过引入透视编码(PE)和透视旋转(PR)技术，有效解决了裁剪图像中相机内参缺失和透视畸变问题，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体姿态估计方法仅使用裁剪图像作为输入，忽略了相机内参对透视关系的影响，且人体偏离图像中心会导致透视畸变，影响模型拟合精度。

Method: 提出PersPose框架：1) Perspective Encoding(PE)编码裁剪图像的相机内参；2) Perspective Rotation(PR)将人体旋转至图像中心以减少透视畸变。

Result: 在3DPW、MPI-INF-3DHP和Human3.6M数据集上达到SOTA性能，其中在3DPW数据集上MPJPE为60.1mm，比之前最佳方法降低7.54%。

Conclusion: PersPose通过显式处理相机内参和透视畸变问题，显著提升了单目3D人体姿态估计的精度，特别是在野外场景下的性能表现。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods estimate the 3D positions of
joints from individual images. Existing 3D HPE approaches often use the cropped
image alone as input for their models. However, the relative depths of joints
cannot be accurately estimated from cropped images without the corresponding
camera intrinsics, which determine the perspective relationship between 3D
objects and the cropped images. In this work, we introduce Perspective Encoding
(PE) to encode the camera intrinsics of the cropped images. Moreover, since the
human subject can appear anywhere within the original image, the perspective
relationship between the 3D scene and the cropped image differs significantly,
which complicates model fitting. Additionally, the further the human subject
deviates from the image center, the greater the perspective distortions in the
cropped image. To address these issues, we propose Perspective Rotation (PR), a
transformation applied to the original image that centers the human subject,
thereby reducing perspective distortions and alleviating the difficulty of
model fitting. By incorporating PE and PR, we propose a novel 3D HPE framework,
PersPose. Experimental results demonstrate that PersPose achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the 3DPW, MPIINF-3DHP, and Human3.6M
datasets. For example, on the in-the-wild dataset 3DPW, PersPose achieves an
MPJPE of 60.1 mm, 7.54% lower than the previous SOTA approach. Code is

TL;DR: CoViPAL是一种层级的上下文视觉token剪枝方法，通过轻量级插件模块在LVLM处理前预测和移除冗余视觉token，显著提升推理效率而不损失精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型处理图像时会产生大量视觉token，导致计算成本高和内存开销大。现有剪枝方法在浅层缺乏足够上下文信息时效果不佳，但许多视觉token在浅层就存在冗余。

Method: 提出CoViPAL方法，使用插件式剪枝模块(PPM)在LVLM处理前进行层级上下文化视觉token剪枝。PPM轻量、模型无关，可无缝集成到各种模型中。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CoViPAL在相同token预算下优于无需训练的剪枝方法，在可比监督下超越基于训练的方法，显著提升推理效率。

Conclusion: CoViPAL为LVLMs提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，在不影响准确性的前提下显著改善推理效率。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process multimodal inputs consisting of
text tokens and vision tokens extracted from images or videos. Due to the rich
visual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens,
leading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant
memory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant
vision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations.
However, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of
sufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are
inherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively
pruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a
layer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a
Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision
tokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight,
model-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring
seamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods
under equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable
supervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve
inference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文首次定义并证明了多重嵌入攻击(MEA)的存在，提出对抗干扰模拟(AIS)训练范式来增强现有深度伪造主动取证方法的鲁棒性，使其在遭受二次水印嵌入后仍能正确提取原始水印。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的快速发展和数字媒体的广泛传播，个人隐私面临严重安全威胁。现有深度伪造主动取证方法基于单次水印嵌入的理想假设，在现实场景中不实用，当受保护图像遭受多次水印嵌入时，原始取证水印会被破坏或移除。

Method: 提出对抗干扰模拟(AIS)通用训练范式，在微调过程中显式模拟MEA场景，引入弹性驱动的损失函数来强制学习稀疏且稳定的水印表示，而不需要修改网络架构。

Result: 大量实验表明，AIS训练范式显著增强了各种现有方法对MEA的鲁棒性，使模型在遭受二次嵌入后仍能正确提取原始水印。

Conclusion: AIS作为一种即插即用的训练范式，有效解决了多重嵌入攻击问题，提升了深度伪造主动取证技术在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of deepfake technologies and the wide dissemination
of digital media, personal privacy is facing increasingly serious security
threats. Deepfake proactive forensics, which involves embedding imperceptible
watermarks to enable reliable source tracking, serves as a crucial defense
against these threats. Although existing methods show strong forensic ability,
they rely on an idealized assumption of single watermark embedding, which
proves impractical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we formally define
and demonstrate the existence of Multi-Embedding Attacks (MEA) for the first
time. When a previously protected image undergoes additional rounds of
watermark embedding, the original forensic watermark can be destroyed or
removed, rendering the entire proactive forensic mechanism ineffective. To
address this vulnerability, we propose a general training paradigm named
Adversarial Interference Simulation (AIS). Rather than modifying the network
architecture, AIS explicitly simulates MEA scenarios during fine-tuning and
introduces a resilience-driven loss function to enforce the learning of sparse
and stable watermark representations. Our method enables the model to maintain
the ability to extract the original watermark correctly even after a second
embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our plug-and-play AIS
training paradigm significantly enhances the robustness of various existing
methods against MEA.

Motivation: 当前深度神经网络在感知错觉轮廓（如abutting grating）方面与人类感知模式存在差异，需要开发更符合人类认知的AI模型。

Method: 提出ICPNet网络，包含多尺度特征投影模块(MFP)提取多尺度表征，特征交互注意力模块(FIAM)促进前馈和反馈特征交互，边缘融合模块(EFM)注入形状约束引导网络关注前景。

Conclusion: 这项研究使基于DNN的模型向人类水平智能迈进了一步，解决了神经网络与人类感知模式在错觉轮廓感知方面的差异问题。

Abstract: Higher levels of machine intelligence demand alignment with human perception
and cognition. Deep neural networks (DNN) dominated machine intelligence have
demonstrated exceptional performance across various real-world tasks.
Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that DNNs fail to perceive illusory
contours like the abutting grating, a discrepancy that misaligns with human
perception patterns. Departing from previous works, we propose a novel deep
network called illusory contour perception network (ICPNet) inspired by the
circuits of the visual cortex. In ICPNet, a multi-scale feature projection
(MFP) module is designed to extract multi-scale representations. To boost the
interaction between feedforward and feedback features, a feature interaction
attention module (FIAM) is introduced. Moreover, drawing inspiration from the
shape bias observed in human perception, an edge detection task conducted via
the edge fusion module (EFM) injects shape constraints that guide the network
to concentrate on the foreground. We assess our method on the existing AG-MNIST
test set and the AG-Fashion-MNIST test sets constructed by this work.
Comprehensive experimental results reveal that ICPNet is significantly more
sensitive to abutting grating illusory contours than state-of-the-art models,
with notable improvements in top-1 accuracy across various subsets. This work
is expected to make a step towards human-level intelligence for DNN-based
models.

Abstract: Identifying quantum flakes is crucial for scalable quantum hardware; however,
automated layer classification from optical microscopy remains challenging due
to substantial appearance shifts across different materials. In this paper, we
propose a new Continual-Learning Framework for Flake Layer Classification
(CLIFF). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of continual
learning in the domain of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Our method enables
the model to differentiate between materials and their physical and optical
properties by freezing a backbone and base head trained on a reference
material. For each new material, it learns a material-specific prompt,
embedding, and a delta head. A prompt pool and a cosine-similarity gate
modulate features and compute material-specific corrections. Additionally, we
incorporate memory replay with knowledge distillation. CLIFF achieves
competitive accuracy with significantly lower forgetting than naive fine-tuning
and a prompt-based baseline.

TL;DR: 提出AdaGAT方法，通过动态调整引导模型的训练状态来增强目标模型的对抗鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗蒸馏方法中可学习的引导模型从零开始学习，难以在协同训练过程中保持最优状态进行有效知识迁移

Method: 开发包含两个独立损失函数的AdaGAT方法，使引导模型更积极参与反向传播以达到最优状态

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和TinyImageNet数据集上验证，相比多种基线模型，目标模型在各种对抗攻击下的鲁棒性得到提升

Conclusion: 适当调整引导模型在特定准确率范围内可以显著增强目标模型的对抗鲁棒性

Abstract: Adversarial distillation (AD) is a knowledge distillation technique that
facilitates the transfer of robustness from teacher deep neural network (DNN)
models to lightweight target (student) DNN models, enabling the target models
to perform better than only training the student model independently. Some
previous works focus on using a small, learnable teacher (guide) model to
improve the robustness of a student model. Since a learnable guide model starts
learning from scratch, maintaining its optimal state for effective knowledge
transfer during co-training is challenging. Therefore, we propose a novel
Adaptive Guidance Adversarial Training (AdaGAT) method. Our method, AdaGAT,
dynamically adjusts the training state of the guide model to install robustness
to the target model. Specifically, we develop two separate loss functions as
part of the AdaGAT method, allowing the guide model to participate more
actively in backpropagation to achieve its optimal state. We evaluated our
approach via extensive experiments on three datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
TinyImageNet, using the WideResNet-34-10 model as the target model. Our
observations reveal that appropriately adjusting the guide model within a
certain accuracy range enhances the target model's robustness across various
adversarial attacks compared to a variety of baseline models.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new instance-level human-object interaction
detection task on videos called ST-HOID, which aims to distinguish fine-grained
human-object interactions (HOIs) and the trajectories of subjects and objects.
It is motivated by the fact that HOI is crucial for human-centric video content
understanding. To solve ST-HOID, we propose a novel method consisting of an
object trajectory detection module and an interaction reasoning module.
Furthermore, we construct the first dataset named VidOR-HOID for ST-HOID
evaluation, which contains 10,831 spatial-temporal HOI instances. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines
generated by the state-of-the-art methods of image human-object interaction
detection, video visual relation detection and video human-object interaction
recognition.

TL;DR: 开发深度学习模型来自动化测量CT图像中的骨骼肌面积，用于检测肌肉减少症，平均误差±3%，Dice相似系数达93%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肌肉减少症与不良手术结果相关，但通过CT测量骨骼肌面积的过程耗时且增加临床工作量，限制了及时检测和管理

Method: 采用迁移学习和自监督学习方法，使用标注和未标注的CT扫描数据集开发深度学习模型，定量评估骨骼肌面积

Result: 模型预测骨骼肌面积的平均误差为±3个百分点，预测掩码的平均Dice相似系数为93%

Conclusion: 该方法展示了肌肉减少症评估和检测完全自动化的途径，解决了类别不平衡和数据有限的问题

Abstract: Sarcopenia is a progressive loss of muscle mass and function linked to poor
surgical outcomes such as prolonged hospital stays, impaired mobility, and
increased mortality. Although it can be assessed through cross-sectional
imaging by measuring skeletal muscle area (SMA), the process is time-consuming
and adds to clinical workloads, limiting timely detection and management;
however, this process could become more efficient and scalable with the
assistance of artificial intelligence applications. This paper presents
high-quality three-dimensional cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) images
of patients with sarcopenia collected at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon
Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Expert clinicians manually annotated the
SMA at the third lumbar vertebra, generating precise segmentation masks. We
develop deep-learning models to measure SMA in CT images and automate this
task. Our methodology employed transfer learning and self-supervised learning
approaches using labelled and unlabeled CT scan datasets. While we developed
qualitative assessment models for detecting sarcopenia, we observed that the
quantitative assessment of SMA is more precise and informative. This approach
also mitigates the issue of class imbalance and limited data availability. Our
model predicted the SMA, on average, with an error of +-3 percentage points
against the manually measured SMA. The average dice similarity coefficient of
the predicted masks was 93%. Our results, therefore, show a pathway to full
automation of sarcopenia assessment and detection.

Result: 在三个RGBT基准测试中取得了令人满意的结果，达到了实时速度，优于最先进的竞争对手

Conclusion: MTNet通过模态感知和Transformer融合有效提升了RGB-T跟踪性能，证明了所提出方法的有效性和实用性

Abstract: The ability to learn robust multi-modality representation has played a
critical role in the development of RGBT tracking. However, the regular fusion
paradigm and the invariable tracking template remain restrictive to the feature
interaction. In this paper, we propose a modality-aware tracker based on
transformer, termed MTNet. Specifically, a modality-aware network is presented
to explore modality-specific cues, which contains both channel aggregation and
distribution module(CADM) and spatial similarity perception module (SSPM). A
transformer fusion network is then applied to capture global dependencies to
reinforce instance representations. To estimate the precise location and tackle
the challenges, such as scale variation and deformation, we design a trident
prediction head and a dynamic update strategy which jointly maintain a reliable
template for facilitating inter-frame communication. Extensive experiments
validate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory results compared with
the state-of-the-art competitors on three RGBT benchmarks while reaching
real-time speed.

Abstract: Foundation models like SAM (Segment Anything Model) exhibit strong zero-shot
image segmentation performance, but often fall short on domain-specific tasks.
Fine-tuning these models typically requires significant manual effort and
domain expertise. In this work, we introduce QTT-SEG, a meta-learning-driven
approach for automating and accelerating the fine-tuning of SAM for image
segmentation. Built on the Quick-Tune hyperparameter optimization framework,
QTT-SEG predicts high-performing configurations using meta-learned cost and
performance models, efficiently navigating a search space of over 200 million
possibilities. We evaluate QTT-SEG on eight binary and five multiclass
segmentation datasets under tight time constraints. Our results show that
QTT-SEG consistently improves upon SAM's zero-shot performance and surpasses
AutoGluon Multimodal, a strong AutoML baseline, on most binary tasks within
three minutes. On multiclass datasets, QTT-SEG delivers consistent gains as
well. These findings highlight the promise of meta-learning in automating model
adaptation for specialized segmentation tasks. Code available at:

Abstract: Compositional visual reasoning has emerged as a key research frontier in
multimodal AI, aiming to endow machines with the human-like ability to
decompose visual scenes, ground intermediate concepts, and perform multi-step
logical inference. While early surveys focus on monolithic vision-language
models or general multimodal reasoning, a dedicated synthesis of the rapidly
expanding compositional visual reasoning literature is still missing. We fill
this gap with a comprehensive survey spanning 2023 to 2025 that systematically
reviews 260+ papers from top venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.). We
first formalize core definitions and describe why compositional approaches
offer advantages in cognitive alignment, semantic fidelity, robustness,
interpretability, and data efficiency. Next, we trace a five-stage paradigm
shift: from prompt-enhanced language-centric pipelines, through tool-enhanced
LLMs and tool-enhanced VLMs, to recently minted chain-of-thought reasoning and
unified agentic VLMs, highlighting their architectural designs, strengths, and
limitations. We then catalog 60+ benchmarks and corresponding metrics that
probe compositional visual reasoning along dimensions such as grounding
accuracy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and high-resolution perception.
Drawing on these analyses, we distill key insights, identify open challenges
(e.g., limitations of LLM-based reasoning, hallucination, a bias toward
deductive reasoning, scalable supervision, tool integration, and benchmark
limitations), and outline future directions, including world-model integration,
human-AI collaborative reasoning, and richer evaluation protocols. By offering
a unified taxonomy, historical roadmap, and critical outlook, this survey aims
to serve as a foundational reference and inspire the next generation of
compositional visual reasoning research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundDiff是一个基于扩散模型的基础性低剂量CT去噪方法，通过两阶段策略（剂量-解剖感知和自适应去噪）实现跨不同剂量水平和解剖区域的统一去噪，在泛化性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的低剂量CT去噪方法通常针对特定剂量水平和解剖区域训练，难以处理不同扫描条件下的噪声特征和解剖异质性，限制了在临床场景中的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出两阶段策略：1）开发剂量-解剖感知对比学习模型（DA-CLIP）学习连续表示来量化剂量变化和识别解剖区域；2）设计剂量-解剖感知扩散模型（DA-Diff），通过基于Mamba的新型条件块（DACB）将学习到的嵌入整合到扩散过程中。

Result: 在两个包含8个剂量水平和3个解剖区域的公共LDCT数据集上的广泛实验表明，FoundDiff在去噪性能上优于现有最先进方法，并对未见过的剂量水平表现出显著的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FoundDiff作为一个基础性扩散模型，能够实现跨不同剂量水平和解剖区域的统一和可泛化的低剂量CT去噪，为解决临床场景中的泛化性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (CT) denoising is crucial for reduced radiation
exposure while ensuring diagnostically acceptable image quality. Despite
significant advancements driven by deep learning (DL) in recent years, existing
DL-based methods, typically trained on a specific dose level and anatomical
region, struggle to handle diverse noise characteristics and anatomical
heterogeneity during varied scanning conditions, limiting their
generalizability and robustness in clinical scenarios. In this paper, we
propose FoundDiff, a foundational diffusion model for unified and generalizable
LDCT denoising across various dose levels and anatomical regions. FoundDiff
employs a two-stage strategy: (i) dose-anatomy perception and (ii) adaptive
denoising. First, we develop a dose- and anatomy-aware contrastive language
image pre-training model (DA-CLIP) to achieve robust dose and anatomy
perception by leveraging specialized contrastive learning strategies to learn
continuous representations that quantify ordinal dose variations and identify
salient anatomical regions. Second, we design a dose- and anatomy-aware
diffusion model (DA-Diff) to perform adaptive and generalizable denoising by
synergistically integrating the learned dose and anatomy embeddings from DACLIP
into diffusion process via a novel dose and anatomy conditional block (DACB)
based on Mamba. Extensive experiments on two public LDCT datasets encompassing
eight dose levels and three anatomical regions demonstrate superior denoising
performance of FoundDiff over existing state-of-the-art methods and the
remarkable generalization to unseen dose levels. The codes and models are
available at https://github.com/hao1635/FoundDiff.

Motivation: 随着生成模型规模扩大，训练成本急剧增加，需要开发无需训练且可扩展的图像编辑框架来实现定制化对象的精准插入。

Method: 采用位置嵌入移植技术指导扩散模型复制参考对象的结构特征，结合角点中心布局将参考图像和背景图像拼接作为FLUX.1-Fill模型的输入，在渐进去噪过程中引导目标区域的噪声分布。

Result: 大量实验表明，PosBridge在结构一致性、外观保真度和计算效率方面均优于主流基线方法。

Conclusion: PosBridge框架具有实用价值和广泛应用潜力，为无需训练的定制化对象插入提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Localized subject-driven image editing aims to seamlessly integrate
user-specified objects into target scenes. As generative models continue to
scale, training becomes increasingly costly in terms of memory and computation,
highlighting the need for training-free and scalable editing frameworks.To this
end, we propose PosBridge an efficient and flexible framework for inserting
custom objects. A key component of our method is positional embedding
transplant, which guides the diffusion model to faithfully replicate the
structural characteristics of reference objects.Meanwhile, we introduce the
Corner Centered Layout, which concatenates reference images and the background
image as input to the FLUX.1-Fill model. During progressive denoising,
positional embedding transplant is applied to guide the noise distribution in
the target region toward that of the reference object. In this way, Corner
Centered Layout effectively directs the FLUX.1-Fill model to synthesize
identity-consistent content at the desired location. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PosBridge outperforms mainstream baselines in structural
consistency, appearance fidelity, and computational efficiency, showcasing its
practical value and potential for broad adoption.

Motivation: 当前语义分割竞赛中，大多数技巧已被现有代码库整合，基线模型性能已足够好。通过可视化分析发现小麦茎秆具有精细结构、像素稀少的特点，容易受到预测不稳定和类别不平衡的影响，因此需要针对茎秆特性进行专门优化。

Method: 1) 使用动态上采样器SAPA增强细节描绘；2) 采用半监督引导蒸馏配合茎秆感知样本选择，挖掘未标注数据价值；3) 应用测试时缩放策略，对图像进行放大和两次分割。基于ViT-Adapter基线模型进行改进。

Result: 该方法在MLCAS 2025小麦语义分割挑战赛中获得第一名，明显超越第二名，证明了针对特定问题本质进行优化的有效性。

Conclusion: 在当今分割竞赛中，关键在于深入理解问题本质而非堆叠通用技巧。针对小麦茎秆的特殊性设计的三个简单但有效的改进策略，成功解决了细粒度结构和类别不平衡问题，取得了竞赛优胜。

Abstract: In this report, we present our solution during the participation of the MLCAS
2025 GWFSS Challenge. This challenge hosts a semantic segmentation competition
specific to wheat plants, which requires to segment three wheat organs
including the head, leaf, and stem, and another background class. In 2025,
participating a segmentation competition is significantly different from that
in previous years where many tricks can play important roles. Nowadays most
segmentation tricks have been well integrated into existing codebases such that
our naive ViT-Adapter baseline has already achieved sufficiently good
performance. Hence, we believe the key to stand out among other competitors is
to focus on the problem nature of wheat per se. By probing visualizations, we
identify the key -- the stem matters. In contrast to heads and leaves, stems
exhibit fine structure and occupy only few pixels, which suffers from fragile
predictions and class imbalance. Building on our baseline, we present three
technical improvements tailored to stems: i) incorporating a dynamic upsampler
SAPA used to enhance detail delineation; ii) leveraging semi-supervised guided
distillation with stem-aware sample selection to mine the treasure beneath
unlabeled data; and iii) applying a test-time scaling strategy to zoom in and
segment twice the image. Despite being simple, the three improvements bring us
to the first place of the competition, outperforming the second place by clear
margins. Code and models will be released at

Conclusion: 该方法为主动Deepfake检测提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: The rapid development of Deepfake technology poses severe challenges to
social trust and information security. While most existing detection methods
primarily rely on passive analyses, due to unresolvable high-quality Deepfake
contents, proactive defense has recently emerged by inserting invisible signals
in advance of image editing. In this paper, we introduce a proactive Deepfake
detection approach based on facial texture features. Since human eyes are more
sensitive to perturbations in smooth regions, we invisibly insert perturbations
within texture regions that have low perceptual saliency, applying localized
perturbations to key texture regions while minimizing unwanted noise in
non-textured areas. Our texture-guided perturbation framework first extracts
preliminary texture features via Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and then
introduces a dual-model attention strategy to generate and optimize texture
perturbations. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW datasets demonstrate the
promising performance of our method in distorting Deepfake generation and
producing obvious visual defects under multiple attack models, providing an
efficient and scalable solution for proactive Deepfake detection.

Conclusion: SpecGen方法有效解决了光谱BRDF数据稀缺问题，实现了高质量的光谱图像生成和渲染

Abstract: Synthesizing spectral images across different wavelengths is essential for
photorealistic rendering. Unlike conventional spectral uplifting methods that
convert RGB images into spectral ones, we introduce SpecGen, a novel method
that generates spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution functions
(BRDFs) from a single RGB image of a sphere. This enables spectral image
rendering under arbitrary illuminations and shapes covered by the corresponding
material. A key challenge in spectral BRDF generation is the scarcity of
measured spectral BRDF data. To address this, we propose the Spectral-Spatial
Tri-plane Aggregation (SSTA) network, which models reflectance responses across
wavelengths and incident-outgoing directions, allowing the training strategy to
leverage abundant RGB BRDF data to enhance spectral BRDF generation.
Experiments show that our method accurately reconstructs spectral BRDFs from
limited spectral data and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in hyperspectral
image reconstruction, achieving an improvement of 8 dB in PSNR. Codes and data
will be released upon acceptance.

show that even state-of-the-art LVLMs, such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, struggle
on the English subset despite it being their primary training language and

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution, meticulously crafted AI-generated images
poses a significant challenge to existing detection methods, which are often
trained and evaluated on low-resolution, automatically generated datasets that
do not align with the complexities of high-resolution scenarios. A common
practice is to resize or center-crop high-resolution images to fit standard
network inputs. However, without full coverage of all pixels, such strategies
risk either obscuring subtle, high-frequency artifacts or discarding
information from uncovered regions, leading to input information loss. In this
paper, we introduce the High-Resolution Detail-Aggregation Network (HiDA-Net),
a novel framework that ensures no pixel is left behind. We use the Feature
Aggregation Module (FAM), which fuses features from multiple full-resolution
local tiles with a down-sampled global view of the image. These local features
are aggregated and fused with global representations for final prediction,
ensuring that native-resolution details are preserved and utilized for
detection. To enhance robustness against challenges such as localized AI
manipulations and compression, we introduce Token-wise Forgery Localization

TL;DR: DiCache是一种无需训练的自适应缓存策略，通过浅层在线探针实时获取缓存误差先验，结合动态缓存轨迹对齐技术，在扩散模型中实现高效加速和更好的视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于缓存的扩散模型加速方法依赖预定义经验法则或数据集级先验，在高度动态的扩散过程中泛化性有限，容易在异常样本上失败。

Method: 提出DiCache框架：1）在线探针分析方案利用浅层在线探针实时获取稳定缓存误差先验；2）动态缓存轨迹对齐基于浅层探针特征轨迹组合多步缓存来更好近似当前特征。

Result: 在WAN 2.1、HunyuanVideo视频生成和Flux图像生成等多种领先扩散模型上的实验表明，DiCache在效率和视觉保真度方面均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: DiCache通过揭示浅层特征差异变化模式与最终输出之间的强相关性，提供了一种统一的训练免费自适应缓存策略，能够自主确定缓存时机并提升视觉质量。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques
for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These
studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to
use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level
priors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for
leveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the
diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on
outlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the
variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion
model and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the
features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these
observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching
strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and
how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of
two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a
shallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in
real time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2)
Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on
shallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current
feature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate
DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual
fidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models
including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法为每种条件类型训练独立控制分支，导致模型结构冗余和计算资源使用效率低下，需要统一的框架来支持多样化条件输入。

Method: 提出Condition Modulated Expert (CoMoE)模块聚合语义相似的补丁特征并分配给专家模块，以及WeaveNet动态蛇形连接机制实现主干网络和控制分支的有效交互。

Result: 在Subjects-200K和MultiGen-20M数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在各种条件图像生成任务中始终达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: UniGen框架在多功能性和有效性方面都具有优势，能够有效缓解多条件场景下的特征纠缠和冗余计算问题。

Abstract: The image-to-image generation task aims to produce controllable images by
leveraging conditional inputs and prompt instructions. However, existing
methods often train separate control branches for each type of condition,
leading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational
resources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation
(UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing
generation efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely
existing parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable
conditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert
(CoMoE) module. This module aggregates semantically similar patch features and
assigns them to dedicated expert modules for visual representation and
conditional modeling. By enabling independent modeling of foreground features
under different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement
and redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge
the information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose
WeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective
interaction between global text-level control from the backbone and
fine-grained control from conditional branches. Extensive experiments on the
Subjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets across various conditional image
generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating its advantages in both versatility and
effectiveness. The code has been uploaded to

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合优化多模态检索器和LVLM的医疗诊断模型，相比标准RAG能够显著提升在具有挑战性的临床案例上的表现，但距离理想性能仍有较大差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策需要解读医学图像进行诊断，从医学文献和医院记录中检索相关视觉信息可以提高诊断准确性。现有标准RAG方法中LVLM的错误信号无法传播到检索器，存在改进空间。

Method: 开发了一个联合优化多模态检索器和LVLM的模型，仅使用通用骨干网络进行轻量级微调，在临床多标签分类和视觉问答任务上进行评估。

Result: 模型在临床多标签分类和视觉问答任务上达到了与医学预训练模型竞争的结果。联合检索优化显著改善了标准RAG在处理具有挑战性案例时的表现。

Conclusion: 虽然正确诊断经常可以通过top检索图像实现，但实际性能与理想性能存在较大差距，前沿LVLM重新排序器也无法弥合这一差距，为未来方法留下了充分的改进空间。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making often involves interpreting images (e.g., radiology)
for making diagnoses. Retrieving relevant visual information from medical
literature and hospital records could enhance diagnostic accuracy. In this
paper, we develop a model in which a multimodal retriever is jointly optimized
with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG where LVLM error signal
is not propagated down to the retriever. We show that using only
general-purpose backbones, with only lightweight fine-tuning, our model is able
to achieve competitive results with medically-pretrained models across clinical
multi-label classification and visual question answering tasks. In a novel
analysis, we additionally find that in many cases different top retrieved
images each lead to different predictions for a given target, and that these
cases are empirically challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval
models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these
challenging cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that
while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top
retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle,
and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room
for improvement by future methods. Code will be made publicly available.

effect, this paper introduces image quality assessment metrics such as PSNR,

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型过于关注外观保真度，导致人体运动不真实且物理上不合理，结构连贯性差。现有数据集主要关注面部或上半身运动，限制了生成方法的运动复杂度。

Method: 提出两阶段解耦方法：1）使用高效的3D结构生成器从文本提示生成人体运动序列；2）在生成的结构序列指导下合成视频外观。引入Human-Aware Dynamic Control模块和改进的密集跟踪约束训练。

Result: MoCo在生成真实且结构连贯的人体视频方面优于现有方法，特别是在全身复杂运动生成上表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过解耦结构和外观生成，结合专门设计的控制模块和大规模全身运动数据集，MoCo成功解决了人体视频生成中的运动一致性和结构连贯性问题。

Abstract: Generating human videos with consistent motion from text prompts remains a
significant challenge, particularly for whole-body or long-range motion.
Existing video generation models prioritize appearance fidelity, resulting in
unrealistic or physically implausible human movements with poor structural
coherence. Additionally, most existing human video datasets primarily focus on
facial or upper-body motions, or consist of vertically oriented dance videos,
limiting the scope of corresponding generation methods to simple movements. To
overcome these challenges, we propose MoCo, which decouples the process of
human video generation into two components: structure generation and appearance
generation. Specifically, our method first employs an efficient 3D structure
generator to produce a human motion sequence from a text prompt. The remaining
video appearance is then synthesized under the guidance of the generated
structural sequence. To improve fine-grained control over sparse human
structures, we introduce Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules and integrate
dense tracking constraints during training. Furthermore, recognizing the
limitations of existing datasets, we construct a large-scale whole-body human
video dataset featuring complex and diverse motions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MoCo outperforms existing approaches in generating realistic
and structurally coherent human videos.

Method: 提出E-BayesSAM框架，包含Token-wise变分贝叶斯推理(T-VBI)进行高效贝叶斯适应，以及自优化Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(SO-KAN)通过自监督学习提高可解释性和修剪冗余token。

Conclusion: E-BayesSAM统一了效率、可靠性和可解释性，将SAM的通用性与临床需求相结合，推动了在安全关键医疗应用中的部署。

Abstract: Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has advanced medical image
segmentation, its Bayesian adaptation for uncertainty-aware segmentation
remains hindered by three key issues: (1) instability in Bayesian fine-tuning
of large pre-trained SAMs; (2) high computation cost due to SAM's massive
parameters; (3) SAM's black-box design limits interpretability. To overcome
these, we propose E-BayesSAM, an efficient framework combining Token-wise
Variational Bayesian Inference (T-VBI) for efficienty Bayesian adaptation and
Self-Optimizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (SO-KAN) for improving
interpretability. T-VBI innovatively reinterprets SAM's output tokens as
dynamic probabilistic weights and reparameterizes them as latent variables
without auxiliary training, enabling training-free VBI for uncertainty
estimation. SO-KAN improves token prediction with learnable spline activations
via self-supervised learning, providing insight to prune redundant tokens to
boost efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on five ultrasound datasets
demonstrated that E-BayesSAM achieves: (i) real-time inference (0.03s/image),
(ii) superior segmentation accuracy (average DSC: Pruned E-BayesSAM's 89.0\%
vs. E-BayesSAM's 88.0% vs. MedSAM's 88.3%), and (iii) identification of four
critical tokens governing SAM's decisions. By unifying efficiency, reliability,
and interpretability, E-BayesSAM bridges SAM's versatility with clinical needs,
advancing deployment in safety-critical medical applications. The source code

Motivation: 由于大规模数据集通常从互联网收集，而许多计算机视觉基准测试是公开可用的，数据泄露（评估基准中的图像在训练期间被看到）会损害模型评估的公平性。

Abstract: We analyze data leakage in visual datasets. Data leakage refers to images in
evaluation benchmarks that have been seen during training, compromising fair
model evaluation. Given that large-scale datasets are often sourced from the
internet, where many computer vision benchmarks are publicly available, our
efforts are focused into identifying and studying this phenomenon. We
characterize visual leakage into different types according to its modality,
coverage, and degree. By applying image retrieval techniques, we unequivocally
show that all the analyzed datasets present some form of leakage, and that all
types of leakage, from severe instances to more subtle cases, compromise the
reliability of model evaluation in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的CPE方法通过从语义角度构建综合的提示，有效改善了视觉-语言模型的对齐能力和零样本分类性能

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on web-scale data exhibit promising
zero-shot generalization but often suffer from semantic misalignment due to
domain gaps between pre-training and downstream tasks. Existing approaches
primarily focus on text prompting with class-specific descriptions and
visual-text adaptation via aligning cropped image regions with textual
descriptions. However, they still face the issues of incomplete textual prompts
and noisy visual prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel constrained prompt
enhancement (CPE) method to improve visual-textual alignment by constructing
comprehensive textual prompts and compact visual prompts from the semantic
perspective. Specifically, our approach consists of two key components:
Topology-Guided Synonymous Semantic Generation (TGSSG) and Category-Agnostic
Discriminative Region Selection (CADRS). Textually, to address the issue of
incomplete semantic expression in textual prompts, our TGSSG first generates
synonymous semantic set for each category via large language models, and
constructs comprehensive textual prompts based on semantic ambiguity entropy
and persistent homology analysis. Visually, to mitigate the irrelevant visual
noise introduced by random cropping, our CADRS identifies discriminative
regions with activation maps outputted by a pre-trained vision model,
effectively filtering out noisy regions and generating compact visual prompts.
Given the comprehensive set of textual prompts and compact set of visual
prompts, we introduce two set-to-set matching strategies based on test-time
adaptation (TTA) and optimal transport (OT) to achieve effective visual-textual
alignment, and so improve zero-shot generalization of VLMs.

Conclusion: FedKLPR有效解决了联邦学习在行人重识别中的统计异构性和通信开销问题，实现了通信效率与模型精度的良好平衡。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a fundamental task in intelligent
surveillance and public safety. Federated learning (FL) offers a
privacy-preserving solution by enabling collaborative model training without
centralized data collection. However, applying FL to real-world re-ID systems
faces two major challenges: statistical heterogeneity across clients due to
non-IID data distributions, and substantial communication overhead caused by
frequent transmission of large-scale models. To address these issues, we
propose FedKLPR, a lightweight and communication-efficient federated learning
framework for person re-identification. FedKLPR introduces four key components.
First, the KL-Divergence Regularization Loss (KLL) constrains local models by
minimizing the divergence from the global feature distribution, effectively
mitigating the effects of statistical heterogeneity and improving convergence
stability under non-IID conditions. Secondly, KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted
Aggregation (KLPWA) integrates pruning ratio and distributional similarity into
the aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of the global model
while significantly reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, sparse
Activation Skipping (SAS) mitigates the dilution of critical parameters during
the aggregation of pruned client models by excluding zero-valued weights from
the update process. Finally, Cross-Round Recovery (CRR) introduces a dynamic
pruning control mechanism that halts pruning when necessary, enabling deeper
compression while maintaining model accuracy. Experimental results on eight
benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedKLPR achieves significant communication
reduction. Compared with the state-of-the-art, FedKLPR reduces 33\%-38\%
communication cost on ResNet-50 and 20\%-40\% communication cost on ResNet-34,
while maintaining model accuracy within 1\% degradation.

Conclusion: TinySR证明了在保持感知质量的前提下，通过精心设计的压缩策略可以显著提升扩散模型的推理效率，使其适用于实时应用场景。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) focuses on recovering
high-quality images from low-resolution inputs that suffer from complex
degradations like noise, blur, and compression. Recently, diffusion models
(DMs) have shown great potential in this area by leveraging strong generative
priors to restore fine details. However, their iterative denoising process
incurs high computational overhead, posing challenges for real-time
applications. Although one-step distillation methods, such as OSEDiff and
TSD-SR, offer faster inference, they remain fundamentally constrained by their
large, over-parameterized model architectures. In this work, we present TinySR,
a compact yet effective diffusion model specifically designed for Real-ISR that
achieves real-time performance while maintaining perceptual quality. We
introduce a Dynamic Inter-block Activation and an Expansion-Corrosion Strategy
to facilitate more effective decision-making in depth pruning. We achieve VAE
compression through channel pruning, attention removal and lightweight SepConv.
We eliminate time- and prompt-related modules and perform pre-caching
techniques to further speed up the model. TinySR significantly reduces
computational cost and model size, achieving up to 5.68x speedup and 83%
parameter reduction compared to its teacher TSD-SR, while still providing high
quality results.

Conclusion: 消融实验、人工评估和分析验证了该代理设计在编辑保真度和上下文保持方面的有效性，为复杂迭代图像编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) generation models,
real-world applications often demand fine-grained, iterative image editing that
existing methods struggle to provide. Key challenges include granular
instruction understanding, robust context preservation during modifications,
and the lack of intelligent feedback mechanisms for iterative refinement. This
paper introduces RefineEdit-Agent, a novel, training-free intelligent agent
framework designed to address these limitations by enabling complex, iterative,
and context-aware image editing. RefineEdit-Agent leverages the powerful
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the advanced visual
understanding and evaluation prowess of Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
within a closed-loop system. Our framework comprises an LVLM-driven instruction
parser and scene understanding module, a multi-level LLM-driven editing planner
for goal decomposition, tool selection, and sequence generation, an iterative
image editing module, and a crucial LVLM-driven feedback and evaluation loop.
To rigorously evaluate RefineEdit-Agent, we propose LongBench-T2I-Edit, a new
benchmark featuring 500 initial images with complex, multi-turn editing
instructions across nine visual dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that RefineEdit-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving an average score of 3.67 on LongBench-T2I-Edit, compared to 2.29 for
Direct Re-Prompting, 2.91 for InstructPix2Pix, 3.16 for GLIGEN-based Edit, and
3.39 for ControlNet-XL. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and analyses of
iterative refinement, backbone choices, tool usage, and robustness to
instruction complexity further validate the efficacy of our agentic design in
delivering superior edit fidelity and context preservation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of neural rendering-based multi-view
surface reconstruction methods, which require an additional mesh extraction
step that is inconvenient and would produce poor-quality surfaces with mesh
aliasing, restricting downstream applications. Building on the explicit mesh
representation and differentiable rasterization framework, this work proposes
an efficient solution that preserves the high efficiency of this framework
while significantly improving reconstruction quality and versatility.
Specifically, we introduce a disentangled geometry and appearance model that
does not rely on deep networks, enhancing learning and broadening
applicability. A neural deformation field is constructed to incorporate global
geometric context, enhancing geometry learning, while a novel regularization
constrains geometric features passed to a neural shader to ensure its accuracy
and boost shading. For appearance, a view-invariant diffuse term is separated
and baked into mesh vertices, further improving rendering efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art training (4.84 minutes) and rendering (0.023 seconds) speeds,
with reconstruction quality that is competitive with top-performing methods.
Moreover, the method enables practical applications such as mesh and texture
editing, showcasing its versatility and application potential. This combination
of efficiency, competitive quality, and broad applicability makes our approach
a valuable contribution to multi-view surface reconstruction and rendering.

Result: PIXIE比测试时优化方法快1.46-4.39倍，速度快几个数量级。即使只在合成数据上训练，也能零样本泛化到真实世界场景。

Conclusion: PIXIE提供了一种快速、通用的3D物理属性推断方法，通过大规模数据集PIXIEVERSE和预训练特征，实现了高效的材质属性预测和物理模拟。

Abstract: Inferring the physical properties of 3D scenes from visual information is a
critical yet challenging task for creating interactive and realistic virtual
worlds. While humans intuitively grasp material characteristics such as
elasticity or stiffness, existing methods often rely on slow, per-scene
optimization, limiting their generalizability and application. To address this
problem, we introduce PIXIE, a novel method that trains a generalizable neural
network to predict physical properties across multiple scenes from 3D visual
features purely using supervised losses. Once trained, our feed-forward network
can perform fast inference of plausible material fields, which coupled with a
learned static scene representation like Gaussian Splatting enables realistic
physics simulation under external forces. To facilitate this research, we also
collected PIXIEVERSE, one of the largest known datasets of paired 3D assets and
physic material annotations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PIXIE is
about 1.46-4.39x better and orders of magnitude faster than test-time
optimization methods. By leveraging pretrained visual features like CLIP, our
method can also zero-shot generalize to real-world scenes despite only ever
been trained on synthetic data. https://pixie-3d.github.io/

*Michael Podsiadly,Brendon K Lay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 结合DINO和Barlow Twins两种自监督学习方法，提出混合模型，在仅使用10%标注数据的条件下达到与DINO相当的性能，同时降低计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无标注图像理解的成本问题，DINO对某些数据增强敏感，Barlow Twins需要大批量训练，结合两者优势以在资源受限环境下实现高效训练。

Method: 将Barlow Twins的冗余减少目标与DINO的自蒸馏策略相结合，在MS COCO数据集上使用10%标注数据进行线性探测训练。

Result: 混合模型达到与DINO相当的损失和分类准确率，同时保持强特征表示能力，注意力可视化显示改进的语义分割能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限环境下训练ViT提供了一种可扩展、标签高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Training AI models to understand images without costly labeled data remains a
challenge. We combine two techniques--DINO (teacher-student learning) and
Barlow Twins (redundancy reduction)--to create a model that learns better with
fewer labels and less compute. While both DINO and Barlow Twins have
independently demonstrated strong performance in self-supervised learning, each
comes with limitations--DINO may be sensitive to certain augmentations, and
Barlow Twins often requires batch sizes too large to fit on consumer hardware.
By combining the redundancy-reduction objective of Barlow Twins with the
self-distillation strategy of DINO, we aim to leverage their complementary
strengths. We train a hybrid model on the MS COCO dataset using only 10\% of
labeled data for linear probing, and evaluate its performance against
standalone DINO and Barlow Twins implementations. Preliminary results show that
the combined approach achieves comparable loss and classification accuracy to
DINO while maintaining strong feature representations. Attention visualizations
further suggest improved semantic segmentation capability in the hybrid model.
This combined method offers a scalable, label-efficient alternative for
training ViTs in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 现有3D物体检测研究主要在训练和测试集分布相同的有限数据集上进行，缺乏对跨数据集适应能力的考察。室内点云数据集因采集方式不同存在多种域差距问题。

Method: 构建包含ScanNet、SUN RGB-D、3D Front及新提出的ProcTHOR-OD和ProcFront数据集的综合基准，实验涵盖合成到真实、点云质量、布局和实例特征等多种适应场景。

Result: 系统分析了不同域差距对3D物体检测器的影响，提出了改进适应性能的方法，为域自适应室内3D物体检测提供了基线结果。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来开发具有更强跨域泛化能力的3D物体检测器奠定了基础，推动了室内场景理解领域的发展。

Abstract: As a fundamental task for indoor scene understanding, 3D object detection has
been extensively studied, and the accuracy on indoor point cloud data has been
substantially improved. However, existing researches have been conducted on
limited datasets, where the training and testing sets share the same
distribution. In this paper, we consider the task of adapting indoor 3D object
detectors from one dataset to another, presenting a comprehensive benchmark
with ScanNet, SUN RGB-D and 3D Front datasets, as well as our newly proposed
large-scale datasets ProcTHOR-OD and ProcFront generated by a 3D simulator.
Since indoor point cloud datasets are collected and constructed in different
ways, the object detectors are likely to overfit to specific factors within
each dataset, such as point cloud quality, bounding box layout and instance
features. We conduct experiments across datasets on different adaptation
scenarios including synthetic-to-real adaptation, point cloud quality
adaptation, layout adaptation and instance feature adaptation, analyzing the
impact of different domain gaps on 3D object detectors. We also introduce
several approaches to improve adaptation performances, providing baselines for
domain adaptive indoor 3D object detection, hoping that future works may
propose detectors with stronger generalization ability across domains. Our

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniMRI是一个统一的视觉-语言基础模型，旨在整合MRI工作流程中的多个任务，包括重建、分割、检测、诊断和报告生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MRI工作流程分散且缺乏通用性，现有方法通常是针对特定解剖结构或应用的，且很少整合影像数据和语言信息。

Method: 采用多阶段训练范式：自监督视觉预训练、视觉-语言对齐、多模态预训练和多任务指令调优，使用来自60个公共数据集的22万MRI体积和1900万MRI切片进行训练。

Result: 定性结果显示OmniMRI能够在单一架构中执行多种任务，包括MRI重建、解剖和病理分割、异常检测、诊断建议和放射报告生成。

Conclusion: OmniMRI有潜力将分散的流程整合为可扩展的通用框架，为统一影像和临床语言的基础模型铺平道路。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is indispensable in clinical practice but
remains constrained by fragmented, multi-stage workflows encompassing
acquisition, reconstruction, segmentation, detection, diagnosis, and reporting.
While deep learning has achieved progress in individual tasks, existing
approaches are often anatomy- or application-specific and lack generalizability
across diverse clinical settings. Moreover, current pipelines rarely integrate
imaging data with complementary language information that radiologists rely on
in routine practice. Here, we introduce OmniMRI, a unified vision-language
foundation model designed to generalize across the entire MRI workflow. OmniMRI
is trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous corpus curated from 60 public
datasets, over 220,000 MRI volumes and 19 million MRI slices, incorporating
image-only data, paired vision-text data, and instruction-response data. Its
multi-stage training paradigm, comprising self-supervised vision pretraining,
vision-language alignment, multimodal pretraining, and multi-task instruction
tuning, progressively equips the model with transferable visual
representations, cross-modal reasoning, and robust instruction-following
capabilities. Qualitative results demonstrate OmniMRI's ability to perform
diverse tasks within a single architecture, including MRI reconstruction,
anatomical and pathological segmentation, abnormality detection, diagnostic
suggestion, and radiology report generation. These findings highlight OmniMRI's
potential to consolidate fragmented pipelines into a scalable, generalist
framework, paving the way toward foundation models that unify imaging and
clinical language for comprehensive, end-to-end MRI interpretation.

TL;DR: ECVT是一种新颖的双分支视频Transformer架构，利用大型视觉语言模型生成多粒度语义描述，通过自适应门控、跨模态注意力和事件图模块整合文本线索，在ActivityNet和THUMOS14数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在复杂未修剪视频中难以捕捉细粒度动作、长期时间依赖和从低级视觉特征提取高级语义信息的局限性。

Method: 采用双分支设计：视频编码分支用于时空特征提取，跨模态引导分支利用LVLM生成全局事件提示和时间子事件提示等多粒度语义描述，通过自适应门控、跨模态注意力和事件图模块整合到视频编码器中。

Result: 在ActivityNet v1.3上达到40.5%的平均mAP，在THUMOS14上达到67.1%的mAP@0.5，超越了现有领先基线方法。

Conclusion: ECVT通过有效整合大型视觉语言模型的语义理解能力，显著提升了视频时间结构和事件逻辑的理解能力，在动作识别和定位任务上取得了突破性进展。

Abstract: Action recognition and localization in complex, untrimmed videos remain a
formidable challenge in computer vision, largely due to the limitations of
existing methods in capturing fine-grained actions, long-term temporal
dependencies, and high-level semantic information from low-level visual
features. This paper introduces the Event-Contextualized Video Transformer
(ECVT), a novel architecture that leverages the advanced semantic understanding
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to bridge this gap. ECVT
employs a dual-branch design, comprising a Video Encoding Branch for
spatio-temporal feature extraction and a Cross-Modal Guidance Branch. The
latter utilizes an LVLM to generate multi-granularity semantic descriptions,
including Global Event Prompting for macro-level narrative and Temporal
Sub-event Prompting for fine-grained action details. These multi-level textual
cues are integrated into the video encoder's learning process through
sophisticated mechanisms such as adaptive gating for high-level semantic
fusion, cross-modal attention for fine-grained feature refinement, and an event
graph module for temporal context calibration. Trained end-to-end with a
comprehensive loss function incorporating semantic consistency and temporal
calibration terms, ECVT significantly enhances the model's ability to
understand video temporal structures and event logic. Extensive experiments on
ActivityNet v1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets demonstrate that ECVT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with an average mAP of 40.5% on ActivityNet v1.3
and mAP@0.5 of 67.1% on THUMOS14, outperforming leading baselines.

Conclusion: 该框架为实现超材料的结构-表示-性能关系集成设计与理解提供了重要基础，案例研究表明其具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Metamaterials are micro-architected structures whose geometry imparts highly
tunable-often counter-intuitive-bulk properties. Yet their design is difficult
because of geometric complexity and a non-trivial mapping from architecture to
behaviour. We address these challenges with three complementary contributions.
(i) MetaDSL: a compact, semantically rich domain-specific language that
captures diverse metamaterial designs in a form that is both human-readable and
machine-parsable. (ii) MetaDB: a curated repository of more than 150,000
parameterized MetaDSL programs together with their
derivatives-three-dimensional geometry, multi-view renderings, and simulated
elastic properties. (iii) MetaBench: benchmark suites that test three core
capabilities of vision-language metamaterial assistants-structure
reconstruction, property-driven inverse design, and performance prediction. We
establish baselines by fine-tuning state-of-the-art vision-language models and
deploy an omni-model within an interactive, CAD-like interface. Case studies
show that our framework provides a strong first step toward integrated design
and understanding of structure-representation-property relationships.

Abstract: In the field of multimodal medical data analysis, leveraging diverse types of
data and understanding their hidden relationships continues to be a research
focus. The main challenges lie in effectively modeling the complex interactions

capturing both local and global dependencies across modalities. To address
these challenges, this paper presents a two-stage multimodal prognosis model,
GraphMMP, which is based on graph neural networks. The proposed model
constructs feature graphs using mutual information and features a global fusion
module built on Mamba, which significantly boosts prognosis performance.
Empirical results show that GraphMMP surpasses existing methods on datasets
related to liver prognosis and the METABRIC study, demonstrating its
effectiveness in multimodal medical prognosis tasks.

Result: 该方法显著增强了跨模态的可迁移性，在各种多模态跟踪任务中超越了当前最先进技术

Conclusion: 所提出的敏感度感知正则化调优框架有效解决了多模态跟踪器优化中的关键挑战，实现了更好的性能表现

Abstract: This paper tackles the critical challenge of optimizing multi-modal trackers
by effectively adapting the pre-trained models for RGB data. Existing
fine-tuning paradigms oscillate between excessive freedom and over-restriction,
both leading to a suboptimal plasticity-stability trade-off. To mitigate this
dilemma, we propose a novel sensitivity-aware regularized tuning framework,
which delicately refines the learning process by incorporating intrinsic
parameter sensitivities. Through a comprehensive investigation from pre-trained
to multi-modal contexts, we identify that parameters sensitive to pivotal
foundational patterns and cross-domain shifts are primary drivers of this
issue. Specifically, we first analyze the tangent space of pre-trained weights
to measure and orient prior sensitivities, dedicated to preserving
generalization. Then, we further explore transfer sensitivities during the
tuning phase, emphasizing adaptability and stability. By incorporating these
sensitivities as regularization terms, our method significantly enhances the
transferability across modalities. Extensive experiments showcase the superior
performance of the proposed method, surpassing current state-of-the-art
techniques across various multi-modal tracking. The source code and models will
be publicly available at https://github.com/zhiwen-xdu/SRTrack.

Abstract: Human social behaviors are inherently multimodal necessitating the

Abstract: LiDAR scanning in outdoor scenes acquires accurate distance measurements over
wide areas, producing large-scale point clouds. Application examples for this
data include robotics, automotive vehicles, and land surveillance. During such
applications, outlier objects from outside the training data will inevitably
appear. Our research contributes a novel approach to open-set segmentation,
leveraging the learnings of object defect-detection research. We also draw on
the Mamba architecture's strong performance in utilising long-range
dependencies and scalability to large data. Combining both, we create a
reconstruction based approach for the task of outdoor scene open-set
segmentation. We show that our approach improves performance not only when
applied to our our own open-set segmentation method, but also when applied to
existing methods. Furthermore we contribute a Mamba based architecture which is
competitive with existing voxel-convolution based methods on challenging,

Conclusion: TMR方法简单有效，通过重新审视经典模板匹配技术，在少样本模式检测任务中取得了优异性能。

Abstract: We address the problem of few-shot pattern detection, which aims to detect
all instances of a given pattern, typically represented by a few exemplars,
from an input image. Although similar problems have been studied in few-shot
object counting and detection (FSCD), previous methods and their benchmarks
have narrowed patterns of interest to object categories and often fail to
localize non-object patterns. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
detector based on template matching and regression, dubbed TMR. While previous
FSCD methods typically represent target exemplars as spatially collapsed
prototypes and lose structural information, we revisit classic template
matching and regression. It effectively preserves and leverages the spatial
layout of exemplars through a minimalistic structure with a small number of
learnable convolutional or projection layers on top of a frozen backbone We
also introduce a new dataset, dubbed RPINE, which covers a wider range of
patterns than existing object-centric datasets. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on the three benchmarks, RPINE, FSCD-147, and
FSCD-LVIS, and demonstrates strong generalization in cross-dataset evaluation.

Conclusion: 研究确定了医学影像分类任务的最优架构配置，但发现RadImageNet预训练并未在ACL撕裂和乳腺病变分类任务上表现出优于ImageNet的性能。

Abstract: Modern computer vision models have proven to be highly useful for medical
imaging classification and segmentation tasks, but the scarcity of medical
imaging data often limits the efficacy of models trained from scratch. Transfer
learning has emerged as a pivotal solution to this, enabling the fine-tuning of
high-performance models on small data. Mei et al. (2022) found that
pre-training CNNs on a large dataset of radiologist-labeled images
(RadImageNet) enhanced model performance on downstream tasks compared to
ImageNet pretraining. The present work extends Mei et al. (2022) by conducting
a comprehensive investigation to determine optimal CNN architectures for breast
lesion malignancy detection and ACL tear detection, as well as performing
statistical analysis to compare the effect of RadImageNet and ImageNet
pre-training on downstream model performance. Our findings suggest that
1-dimensional convolutional classifiers with skip connections, ResNet50
pre-trained backbones, and partial backbone unfreezing yields optimal
downstream medical classification performance. Our best models achieve AUCs of
0.9969 for ACL tear detection and 0.9641 for breast nodule malignancy
detection, competitive with the results reported by Mei et al. (2022) and
surpassing other previous works. We do not find evidence confirming RadImageNet
pre-training to provide superior downstream performance for ACL tear and breast

Abstract: In trustworthy medical diagnosis systems, integrating out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection aims to identify unknown diseases in samples, thereby
mitigating the risk of misdiagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel OOD
detection framework based on vision-language models (VLMs), which integrates
hierarchical visual information to cope with challenging unknown diseases that
resemble known diseases. Specifically, a cross-scale visual fusion strategy is
proposed to couple visual embeddings from multiple scales. This enriches the
detailed representation of medical images and thus improves the discrimination
of unknown diseases. Moreover, a cross-scale hard pseudo-OOD sample generation
strategy is proposed to benefit OOD detection maximally. Experimental
evaluations on three public medical datasets support that the proposed
framework achieves superior OOD detection performance compared to existing
methods. The source code is available at https://openi.pcl.ac.cn/OpenMedIA/HVL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态预收集偏好或微调，难以适应动态变化的用户意图，需要实现实时、训练免费的偏好对齐图像生成

Method: 将任务解耦为偏好理解和偏好引导生成：利用MLLM从参考图像提取全局偏好信号并丰富提示词；结合全局关键词控制和局部区域感知交叉注意力调制来引导扩散模型

Result: 在Viper数据集和自建基准测试中，方法在定量指标和人工评估上均优于现有方法

Conclusion: 框架支持多轮交互优化，为基于对话的生成和MLLM-扩散模型集成开辟了新可能性

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has greatly enhanced creative expression, yet
achieving preference-aligned generation in a real-time and training-free manner
remains challenging. Previous methods often rely on static, pre-collected
preferences or fine-tuning, limiting adaptability to evolving and nuanced user
intents. In this paper, we highlight the need for instant preference-aligned
T2I generation and propose a training-free framework grounded in multimodal
large language model (MLLM) priors. Our framework decouples the task into two
components: preference understanding and preference-guided generation. For
preference understanding, we leverage MLLMs to automatically extract global
preference signals from a reference image and enrich a given prompt using
structured instruction design. Our approach supports broader and more
fine-grained coverage of user preferences than existing methods. For
preference-guided generation, we integrate global keyword-based control and
local region-aware cross-attention modulation to steer the diffusion model
without additional training, enabling precise alignment across both global
attributes and local elements. The entire framework supports multi-round
interactive refinement, facilitating real-time and context-aware image
generation. Extensive experiments on the Viper dataset and our collected
benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms prior approaches in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations, and opens up new possibilities for
dialog-based generation and MLLM-diffusion integration.

TL;DR: 提出了增量动态更新（IDU）管道，通过少量新图像高效更新3D高斯泼溅模型，减少军事虚拟环境更新的时间和成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 军事组织开发高分辨率3D虚拟环境成本高昂，战场条件动态变化使得频繁全规模更新耗时耗资

Method: 相机姿态估计对齐新图像，变化检测识别场景修改，3D生成AI创建新资产，人工指导确保精度，单次更新一个对象

Result: IDU管道显著减少更新时间和人工成本

Conclusion: 为快速演变的军事场景提供经济高效的目标化3D模型维护解决方案

Abstract: For simulation and training purposes, military organizations have made
substantial investments in developing high-resolution 3D virtual environments
through extensive imaging and 3D scanning. However, the dynamic nature of
battlefield conditions-where objects may appear or vanish over time-makes
frequent full-scale updates both time-consuming and costly. In response, we
introduce the Incremental Dynamic Update (IDU) pipeline, which efficiently
updates existing 3D reconstructions, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with
only a small set of newly acquired images. Our approach starts with camera pose
estimation to align new images with the existing 3D model, followed by change
detection to pinpoint modifications in the scene. A 3D generative AI model is
then used to create high-quality 3D assets of the new elements, which are
seamlessly integrated into the existing 3D model. The IDU pipeline incorporates
human guidance to ensure high accuracy in object identification and placement,
with each update focusing on a single new object at a time. Experimental
results confirm that our proposed IDU pipeline significantly reduces update
time and labor, offering a cost-effective and targeted solution for maintaining
up-to-date 3D models in rapidly evolving military scenarios.

TL;DR: HERO是一个针对世界模型的无训练分层加速框架，通过浅层补丁刷新和深层线性外推机制，实现1.73倍加速且质量损失最小


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成驱动型世界模型由于扩散模型的迭代特性导致推理速度慢，现有加速技术直接应用于世界模型会导致质量下降

Method: 分层加速策略：浅层使用补丁刷新机制选择需要重新计算的token；深层使用线性外推方案直接估计中间特征，绕过注意力模块和前馈网络计算

Result: 实验显示HERO实现了1.73倍的加速，质量退化最小，显著优于现有的扩散加速方法

Conclusion: HERO框架有效解决了世界模型推理效率问题，通过利用特征耦合现象实现高质量加速

Abstract: Generation-driven world models create immersive virtual environments but
suffer slow inference due to the iterative nature of diffusion models. While
recent advances have improved diffusion model efficiency, directly applying
these techniques to world models introduces limitations such as quality
degradation. In this paper, we present HERO, a training-free hierarchical
acceleration framework tailored for efficient world models. Owing to the
multi-modal nature of world models, we identify a feature coupling phenomenon,
wherein shallow layers exhibit high temporal variability, while deeper layers
yield more stable feature representations. Motivated by this, HERO adopts
hierarchical strategies to accelerate inference: (i) In shallow layers, a
patch-wise refresh mechanism efficiently selects tokens for recomputation. With
patch-wise sampling and frequency-aware tracking, it avoids extra metric
computation and remain compatible with FlashAttention. (ii) In deeper layers, a
linear extrapolation scheme directly estimates intermediate features. This
completely bypasses the computations in attention modules and feed-forward
networks. Our experiments show that HERO achieves a 1.73$\times$ speedup with
minimal quality degradation, significantly outperforming existing diffusion
acceleration methods.

Conclusion: TinyGiantVLM成功地将视觉感知与空间理解相结合，在复杂工业环境中展现出强大的空间推理能力，证明了轻量级模块化框架的有效性。

Abstract: Reasoning about fine-grained spatial relationships in warehouse-scale
environments poses a significant challenge for existing vision-language models
(VLMs), which often struggle to comprehend 3D layouts, object arrangements, and
multimodal cues in real-world industrial settings. In this paper, we present
TinyGiantVLM, a lightweight and modular two-stage framework designed for
physical spatial reasoning, distinguishing itself from traditional geographic
reasoning in complex logistics scenes. Our approach encodes both global and
region-level features from RGB and depth modalities using pretrained visual
backbones. To effectively handle the complexity of high-modality inputs and
diverse question types, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) fusion
module, which dynamically combines spatial representations to support
downstream reasoning tasks and improve convergence. Training is conducted in a
two-phase strategy: the first phase focuses on generating free-form answers to
enhance spatial reasoning ability, while the second phase uses normalized
answers for evaluation. Evaluated on Track 3 of the AI City Challenge 2025, our
64M-parameter base model achieved 5th place on the leaderboard with a score of
66.8861, demonstrating strong performance in bridging visual perception and
spatial understanding in industrial environments. We further present an
80M-parameter variant with expanded MoE capacity, which demonstrates improved
performance on spatial reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: DEHVF是一种基于动态嵌入和分层视觉特征融合的高效视觉语言微调方法，通过轻量级分层视觉融合器动态选择和融合与LLM各层语义粒度对应的分层特征，避免序列扩展问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将视觉特征投影后与文本标记拼接会导致输入序列长度显著增加，造成大量计算开销。现有融合方法虽然缓解了序列长度问题，但往往忽略了模型内的分层语义表示和浅层视觉编码层中的细粒度视觉信息

Method: 通过轻量级分层视觉融合器动态选择和融合与LLM各层语义粒度对应的分层特征，将融合后的层相关视觉特征投影对齐后直接嵌入到LLM相应层的前馈网络中

Result: 在各种VL基准测试中，包括ScienceQA上的视觉问答和COCO Captions上的图像描述，DEHVF在保持高效训练和推理的同时，比现有的参数高效微调基线实现了更高的准确性

Conclusion: DEHVF方法通过动态融合多层视觉信息，仅微调少量参数就能实现跨模态信息在相同语义粒度上的精确对齐和互补，解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) commonly follow a paradigm that projects
visual features and then concatenates them with text tokens to form a unified
sequence input for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this paradigm leads
to a significant increase in the length of the input sequence, resulting in
substantial computational overhead. Existing methods attempt to fuse visual
information into the intermediate layers of LLMs, which alleviate the sequence
length issue but often neglect the hierarchical semantic representations within
the model and the fine-grained visual information available in the shallower
visual encoding layers. To address this limitation, we propose DEHVF, an
efficient vision-language fine-tuning method based on dynamic embedding and
fusion of hierarchical visual features. Its core lies in leveraging the
inherent hierarchical representation characteristics of visual encoders and
language models. Through a lightweight hierarchical visual fuser, it
dynamically selects and fuses hierarchical features corresponding to semantic
granularity based on the internal representations of each layer in LLMs. The
fused layer-related visual features are then projected and aligned before being
directly embedded into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of the corresponding
layer in LLMs. This approach not only avoids sequence expansion but also
dynamically fuses multi-layer visual information. By fine-tuning only a small
number of parameters, DEHVF achieves precise alignment and complementarity of
cross-modal information at the same semantic granularity. We conducted
experiments across various VL benchmarks, including visual question answering
on ScienceQA and image captioning on COCO Captions. The results demonstrate
that DEHVF achieves higher accuracy than existing parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) baselines while maintaining efficient training and
inference.

Motivation: 开发一个非物种特定的快速动物个体识别算法，能够处理大规模图像数据库并提高识别准确性

Method: 提出两种基于关键点（热点）提取和匹配的方法：1）顺序查询匹配，为每个数据库图像生成独立分数并排序；2）基于快速最近邻搜索的实例识别方法，采用竞争性评分机制

Result: 在1000+图像的数据库上测试，比现有方法更准确，每个查询图像只需几秒钟即可完成匹配

Conclusion: HotSpotter算法在动物个体识别任务中表现出色，具有快速、准确和跨物种适用的特点

Abstract: We present HotSpotter, a fast, accurate algorithm for identifying individual
animals against a labeled database. It is not species specific and has been
applied to Grevy's and plains zebras, giraffes, leopards, and lionfish. We
describe two approaches, both based on extracting and matching keypoints or
"hotspots". The first tests each new query image sequentially against each
database image, generating a score for each database image in isolation, and
ranking the results. The second, building on recent techniques for instance
recognition, matches the query image against the database using a fast nearest
neighbor search. It uses a competitive scoring mechanism derived from the Local
Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor algorithm recently proposed for category
recognition. We demonstrate results on databases of more than 1000 images,
producing more accurate matches than published methods and matching each query
image in just a few seconds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT成像中原始数据采集时，欠采样和噪声等因素会严重降低重建图像质量，传统校正方法缺乏对不同类型伪影的通用性。

Method: 提出UniSino基础模型，直接在投影域标准化数据，训练框架结合了投影数据的物理特性，支持多个子任务的处理。

Result: 实验结果表明UniSino在单一和混合欠采样情况下都能获得优越的重建质量，展现出出色的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniSino为CT投影数据增强提供了一个通用的基础模型解决方案，在多个基准数据集上表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: During raw-data acquisition in CT imaging, diverse factors can degrade the
collected sinograms, with undersampling and noise leading to severe artifacts
and noise in reconstructed images and compromising diagnostic accuracy.
Conventional correction methods rely on manually designed algorithms or fixed
empirical parameters, but these approaches often lack generalizability across
heterogeneous artifact types. To address these limitations, we propose UniSino,
a foundation model for universal CT sinogram standardization. Unlike existing
foundational models that operate in image domain, UniSino directly standardizes
data in the projection domain, which enables stronger generalization across
diverse undersampling scenarios. Its training framework incorporates the
physical characteristics of sinograms, enhancing generalization and enabling
robust performance across multiple subtasks spanning four benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate thatUniSino achieves superior reconstruction
quality both single and mixed undersampling case, demonstrating exceptional
robustness and generalization in sinogram enhancement for CT imaging. The code

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注预测ADAS-Cog总分，但忽略了13个子分数的预测价值，这些子分数反映不同的认知领域，对总分有不同影响

Method: 使用Vision Transformer作为特征提取器，构建多任务学习框架，系统研究子分数特异性损失加权对模型性能的影响

Result: 提出的加权策略具有群体依赖性：强加权对MRI模式更异质的MCI受试者效果更好，中等加权对变异度较低的CN受试者更有效

Conclusion: 统一加权未充分利用关键子分数并限制泛化能力，提出的框架为基于MRI的AD预后提供了灵活可解释的端到端学习方法

Abstract: Prognostic modeling is essential for forecasting future clinical scores and
enabling early detection of Alzheimers disease (AD). While most existing
methods focus on predicting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the
predictive value of its 13 sub-scores, which reflect distinct cognitive
domains. Some sub-scores may exert greater influence on determining global
scores. Assigning higher loss weights to these clinically meaningful sub-scores
can guide the model to focus on more relevant cognitive domains, enhancing both
predictive accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we propose a weighted
Vision Transformer (ViT)-based multi-task learning (MTL) framework to jointly
predict the ADAS-Cog global score using baseline MRI scans and its 13
sub-scores at Month 24. Our framework integrates ViT as a feature extractor and
systematically investigates the impact of sub-score-specific loss weighting on
model performance. Results show that our proposed weighting strategies are
group-dependent: strong weighting improves performance for MCI subjects with
more heterogeneous MRI patterns, while moderate weighting is more effective for
CN subjects with lower variability. Our findings suggest that uniform weighting
underutilizes key sub-scores and limits generalization. The proposed framework
offers a flexible, interpretable approach to AD prognosis using end-to-end
MRI-based learning. (Github repo link will be provided after review)

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型中视觉token过多导致的推理效率低下问题，需要在压缩视觉token的同时尽可能保留更多视觉信息。

Method: 提出图基础的视觉token聚合(VTA)模块，将视觉token视为节点构建语义相似度图，将移除token的信息聚合到保留token中；引入分组token选择策略(GTS)，通过文本token指导将视觉token分为保留和移除两组。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5、LLaVA-NeXT和Video-LLaVA等多个基准测试中，VISA方法始终优于先前方法，实现了模型性能和推理速度之间的优越平衡。

Conclusion: VISA方法通过创新的视觉token压缩策略，有效解决了MLLMs推理效率问题，在保持视觉信息完整性的同时显著提升了推理速度。

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel method called group-wise \textbf{VI}sual
token \textbf{S}election and \textbf{A}ggregation (VISA) to address the issue
of inefficient inference stemming from excessive visual tokens in multimoal
large language models (MLLMs). Compared with previous token pruning approaches,
our method can preserve more visual information while compressing visual
tokens. We first propose a graph-based visual token aggregation (VTA) module.
VTA treats each visual token as a node, forming a graph based on semantic
similarity among visual tokens. It then aggregates information from removed
tokens into kept tokens based on this graph, producing a more compact visual
token representation. Additionally, we introduce a group-wise token selection
strategy (GTS) to divide visual tokens into kept and removed ones, guided by
text tokens from the final layers of each group. This strategy progressively
aggregates visual information, enhancing the stability of the visual
information extraction process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Video-LLaVA across various benchmarks to validate
the efficacy of VISA. Our method consistently outperforms previous methods,
achieving a superior trade-off between model performance and inference speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统虚拟试穿系统过度依赖人体掩码，对服装属性控制有限，且在真实场景中泛化能力差。本文旨在克服这些限制，开发更灵活、精确的虚拟试穿解决方案。

Method: 基于多模态扩散变换器(MM-DiT)架构，通过专用条件路径将参考人物图像和目标服装图像直接整合到去噪过程中。采用双向生成策略构建数据集：一个管道使用基于掩码的模型生成参考图像，另一个对称的"Try-Off"模型以自监督方式恢复相应服装图像。

Conclusion: JCo-MVTON通过创新的多模态扩散变换器架构和双向数据集构建策略，成功解决了虚拟试穿系统中的关键挑战，为实际应用提供了高质量、可控性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual try-on systems have long been hindered by heavy reliance on human
body masks, limited fine-grained control over garment attributes, and poor
generalization to real-world, in-the-wild scenarios. In this paper, we propose
JCo-MVTON (Jointly Controllable Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Mask-Free
Virtual Try-On), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by
integrating diffusion-based image generation with multi-modal conditional
fusion. Built upon a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) backbone, our
approach directly incorporates diverse control signals -- such as the reference
person image and the target garment image -- into the denoising process through
dedicated conditional pathways that fuse features within the self-attention
layers. This fusion is further enhanced with refined positional encodings and
attention masks, enabling precise spatial alignment and improved garment-person
integration. To address data scarcity and quality, we introduce a bidirectional
generation strategy for dataset construction: one pipeline uses a mask-based
model to generate realistic reference images, while a symmetric ``Try-Off''
model, trained in a self-supervised manner, recovers the corresponding garment
images. The synthesized dataset undergoes rigorous manual curation, allowing
iterative improvement in visual fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate
that JCo-MVTON achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks
including DressCode, significantly outperforming existing methods in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations. Moreover, it shows strong
generalization in real-world applications, surpassing commercial systems.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决多图像VQA中的视觉冗余问题，提高模型性能，代码将公开

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant progress in Visual Question Answering (VQA), evolving from Single
to Multi Image VQA (MVQA). However, the increased number of images in MVQA
inevitably introduces substantial visual redundancy that is irrelevant to
question answering, negatively impacting both accuracy and efficiency. To
address this issue, existing methods lack flexibility in controlling the number
of compressed visual tokens and tend to produce discrete visual fragments,
which hinder MLLMs' ability to comprehend images holistically. In this paper,
we propose a straightforward yet universal Adaptive Visual Anchoring strategy,
which can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs, offering significant
accuracy improvements through adaptive compression. Meanwhile, to balance the
results derived from both global and compressed visual input, we further
introduce a novel collaborative decoding mechanism, enabling optimal
performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method,
demonstrating consistent performance improvements across various MLLMs. The
code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成更接近现实逻辑、具有更合理交互关系的高质量图像，对交互"动作"概念的理解更加准确。

Abstract: In Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, the complexity of entities and their
intricate interactions pose a significant challenge for T2I method based on
diffusion model: how to effectively control entity and their interactions to
produce high-quality images. To address this, we propose CEIDM, a image
generation method based on diffusion model with dual controls for entity and
interaction. First, we propose an entity interactive relationships mining
approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs), extracting reasonable and rich
implicit interactive relationships through chain of thought to guide diffusion
models to generate high-quality images that are closer to realistic logic and
have more reasonable interactive relationships. Furthermore, We propose an
interactive action clustering and offset method to cluster and offset the
interactive action features contained in each text prompts. By constructing
global and local bidirectional offsets, we enhance semantic understanding and
detail supplementation of original actions, making the model's understanding of
the concept of interactive "actions" more accurate and generating images with
more accurate interactive actions. Finally, we design an entity control network
which generates masks with entity semantic guidance, then leveraging
multi-scale convolutional network to enhance entity feature and dynamic network
to fuse feature. It effectively controls entities and significantly improves
image quality. Experiments show that the proposed CEIDM method is better than
the most representative existing methods in both entity control and their
interaction control.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注ADAS-Cog总分预测，忽略了子项评分在领域特异性认知衰退中的预测价值，且先前多任务学习研究未充分探索子项对总分的贡献机制。

Method: 采用Vision Transformer和Swin Transformer架构提取MRI影像特征，与纵向临床评分融合，构建多任务学习框架同时预测24个月时的总分和13个子项评分。

Result: 子项学习提高了总分预测精度；Q1、Q4、Q8等少数子项主导总分预测但预测误差较高；临床特征主导导致模型不稳定，MRI特征未能充分发挥作用。

Conclusion: 研究证明了子项信息建模的价值，指出需要改进多模态融合和自适应损失加权来实现更平衡的学习，为构建可解释且临床稳健的AD预测框架提供见解。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical scores is critical for early detection and
prognosis of Alzheimers disease (AD). While existing approaches primarily focus
on forecasting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the predictive
value of its sub-scores (13 items), which capture domain-specific cognitive
decline. In this study, we propose a multi task learning (MTL) framework that
jointly predicts the global ADAS-Cog score and its sub-scores (13 items) at
Month 24 using baseline MRI and longitudinal clinical scores from baseline and
Month 6. The main goal is to examine how each sub scores particularly those
associated with MRI features contribute to the prediction of the global score,
an aspect largely neglected in prior MTL studies. We employ Vision Transformer
(ViT) and Swin Transformer architectures to extract imaging features, which are
fused with longitudinal clinical inputs to model cognitive progression. Our
results show that incorporating sub-score learning improves global score
prediction. Subscore level analysis reveals that a small subset especially Q1
(Word Recall), Q4 (Delayed Recall), and Q8 (Word Recognition) consistently
dominates the predicted global score. However, some of these influential
sub-scores exhibit high prediction errors, pointing to model instability.
Further analysis suggests that this is caused by clinical feature dominance,
where the model prioritizes easily predictable clinical scores over more
complex MRI derived features. These findings emphasize the need for improved
multimodal fusion and adaptive loss weighting to achieve more balanced
learning. Our study demonstrates the value of sub score informed modeling and
provides insights into building more interpretable and clinically robust AD
prediction frameworks. (Github repo provided)

Conclusion: 该方法为静态图像和视频帧提供了一种轻量级、可解释且有效的解决方案，非常适合自动化内容验证和数字取证的实际应用

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has led to a growing prevalence of
highly realistic AI-generated images, posing significant challenges for digital
forensics and content authentication. Conventional detection methods mainly
rely on deep learning models that extract global features, which often overlook
subtle structural inconsistencies and demand substantial computational
resources. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid detection
framework that combines a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) with a novel
edge-based image processing module. The edge-based module computes variance
from edge-difference maps generated before and after smoothing, exploiting the
observation that AI-generated images typically exhibit smoother textures,
weaker edges, and reduced noise compared to real images. When applied as a
post-processing step on ViT predictions, this module enhances sensitivity to
fine-grained structural cues while maintaining computational efficiency.
Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE, Artistic, and Custom Curated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior detection performance
across all benchmarks, attaining 97.75% accuracy and a 97.77% F1-score on
CIFAKE, surpassing widely adopted state-of-the-art models. These results
establish the proposed method as a lightweight, interpretable, and effective
solution for both still images and video frames, making it highly suitable for
real-world applications in automated content verification and digital
forensics.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究视觉语音识别(VSR)系统的轻量级架构设计，通过采用高效图像分类模型和轻量块设计来降低硬件成本，同时保持强大的识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度网络在VSR中实现了突出的识别性能，但计算成本高、硬件要求高，限制了在资源受限的实际场景中的应用。需要开发资源需求低但性能强的轻量级VSR架构。

Method: 采用标准的双网络设计范式：一个网络处理视觉特征提取，另一个网络利用提取的特征进行序列分类。首先对图像分类领域的高效模型进行基准测试，然后在时间卷积网络背榜中采用轻量块设计，构建了多个统一的轻量级模型。

Result: 在最大的公共英语单词数据库上进行实验，证明了所开发模型的有效性和实用性，能够在低资源需求的前提下实现强大的识别性能。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了资源需求低但性能强的轻量级VSR架构，有助于推进语音识别系统在实际应用场景中的更广泛部署和应用。代码和训练好的模型将公开供社区使用。

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR) systems decode spoken words from an input
sequence using only the video data. Practical applications of such systems
include medical assistance as well as human-machine interactions. A VSR system
is typically employed in a complementary role in cases where the audio is
corrupt or not available. In order to accurately predict the spoken words,
these architectures often rely on deep neural networks in order to extract
meaningful representations from the input sequence. While deep architectures
achieve impressive recognition performance, relying on such models incurs
significant computation costs which translates into increased resource demands
in terms of hardware requirements and results in limited applicability in
real-world scenarios where resources might be constrained. This factor prevents
wider adoption and deployment of speech recognition systems in more practical
applications. In this work, we aim to alleviate this issue by developing
architectures for VSR that have low hardware costs. Following the standard
two-network design paradigm, where one network handles visual feature
extraction and another one utilizes the extracted features to classify the
entire sequence, we develop lightweight end-to-end architectures by first
benchmarking efficient models from the image classification literature, and
then adopting lightweight block designs in a temporal convolution network
backbone. We create several unified models with low resource requirements but
strong recognition performance. Experiments on the largest public database for
English words demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our developed
models. Code and trained models will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: Wound3DAssist是一个基于单目消费级视频的3D伤口评估框架，通过智能手机视频生成准确3D模型，实现非接触式自动测量，解决了传统2D方法在视角失真、视野限制和深度捕获方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性伤口管理是重大医疗挑战，临床评估依赖主观且耗时的手动记录方法。现有2D数字视频测量框架存在视角失真、视野有限、无法捕获伤口深度等问题，特别是在解剖结构复杂或弯曲区域。

Method: 开发Wound3DAssist框架，从手持智能手机短视频生成精确3D模型，集成3D重建、伤口分割、组织分类和伤口周围分析到模块化工作流程中，实现非接触式自动测量。

Conclusion: Wound3DAssist展示了在实际临床应用中可行性，为慢性伤口管理提供了更准确、高效的3D评估解决方案。

Abstract: Managing chronic wounds remains a major healthcare challenge, with clinical
assessment often relying on subjective and time-consuming manual documentation
methods. Although 2D digital videometry frameworks aided the measurement
process, these approaches struggle with perspective distortion, a limited field
of view, and an inability to capture wound depth, especially in anatomically
complex or curved regions. To overcome these limitations, we present
Wound3DAssist, a practical framework for 3D wound assessment using monocular
consumer-grade videos. Our framework generates accurate 3D models from short
handheld smartphone video recordings, enabling non-contact, automatic
measurements that are view-independent and robust to camera motion. We
integrate 3D reconstruction, wound segmentation, tissue classification, and
periwound analysis into a modular workflow. We evaluate Wound3DAssist across
digital models with known geometry, silicone phantoms, and real patients.
Results show that the framework supports high-quality wound bed visualization,
millimeter-level accuracy, and reliable tissue composition analysis. Full
assessments are completed in under 20 minutes, demonstrating feasibility for
real-world clinical use.

TL;DR: CAVIA是一个无需训练的视频理解框架，通过推理-感知协调机制实现动态视觉注意力分配，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长视频问答系统采用刚性流水线，将推理与感知解耦，导致信息丢失或计算效率低下，无法根据具体查询需求自适应提取视觉证据。

Method: CAVIA采用闭环系统，推理持续指导视觉提取：1)分层推理精确定位关键帧；2)跨模态语义桥接实现目标提取；3)置信度驱动的迭代合成。

Result: 在EgoSchema(65.7%, +5.3%)、NExT-QA(76.1%, +2.6%)和IntentQA(73.8%, +6.9%)等基准测试中达到state-of-the-art性能。

Conclusion: 动态推理-感知协调为视频理解提供了可扩展的范式，证明了自适应视觉注意力分配的重要性。

Abstract: Human video comprehension demonstrates dynamic coordination between reasoning
and visual attention, adaptively focusing on query-relevant details. However,
current long-form video question answering systems employ rigid pipelines that
decouple reasoning from perception, leading to either information loss through
premature visual abstraction or computational inefficiency through exhaustive
processing. The core limitation lies in the inability to adapt visual
extraction to specific reasoning requirements, different queries demand
fundamentally different visual evidence from the same video content. In this
work, we present CAVIA, a training-free framework that revolutionizes video
understanding through reasoning, perception coordination. Unlike conventional
approaches where visual processing operates independently of reasoning, CAVIA
creates a closed-loop system where reasoning continuously guides visual
extraction based on identified information gaps. CAVIA introduces three
innovations: (1) hierarchical reasoning, guided localization to precise frames;
(2) cross-modal semantic bridging for targeted extraction; (3)
confidence-driven iterative synthesis. CAVIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmarks: EgoSchema (65.7%, +5.3%), NExT-QA
(76.1%, +2.6%), and IntentQA (73.8%, +6.9%), demonstrating that dynamic
reasoning-perception coordination provides a scalable paradigm for video
understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HyTver的新型混合损失函数，用于解决多发性硬化病变分割中的数据不平衡问题，在保持Dice分数0.659的同时，确保距离指标与其他流行函数相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向多发性硬化病变分割面临输入输出数据不平衡的挑战，现有损失函数如Dice损失和交叉熵损失对此考虑不足，需要开发更好的损失函数来解决不平衡问题。

Method: 提出HyTver混合损失函数，该函数在解决数据不平衡问题的同时避免了其他损失函数计算复杂或仅优化区域指标的问题。

Result: HyTver实现了0.659的Dice分数，同时距离指标与其他流行损失函数相当，并在预训练模型上表现出良好的稳定性。

Conclusion: HyTver是一种有效的混合损失函数，能够在多发性硬化病变分割中平衡不同指标性能，解决数据不平衡问题。

Abstract: Longitudinal Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation is a particularly
challenging problem that involves both input and output imbalance in the data
and segmentation. Therefore in order to develop models that are practical, one
of the solutions is to develop better loss functions. Most models naively use
either Dice loss or Cross-Entropy loss or their combination without too much
consideration. However, one must select an appropriate loss function as the
imbalance can be mitigated by selecting a proper loss function. In order to
solve the imbalance problem, multiple loss functions were proposed that claimed
to solve it. They come with problems of their own which include being too
computationally complex due to hyperparameters as exponents or having
detrimental performance in metrics other than region-based ones. We propose a
novel hybrid loss called HyTver that achieves good segmentation performance
while maintaining performance in other metrics. We achieve a Dice score of
0.659 while also ensuring that the distance-based metrics are comparable to
other popular functions. In addition, we also evaluate the stability of the
loss functions when used on a pre- trained model and perform extensive
comparisons with other popular loss functions

Abstract: Early diagnosis of plant diseases is critical for global food safety, yet
most AI solutions lack the generalization required for real-world agricultural
diversity. These models are typically constrained to specific species, failing
to perform accurately across the broad spectrum of cultivated plants. To
address this gap, we first introduce the FloraSyntropy Archive, a large-scale
dataset of 178,922 images across 35 plant species, annotated with 97 distinct
disease classes. We establish a benchmark by evaluating numerous existing
models on this archive, revealing a significant performance gap. We then
propose FloraSyntropy-Net, a novel federated learning framework (FL) that
integrates a Memetic Algorithm (MAO) for optimal base model selection
(DenseNet201), a novel Deep Block for enhanced feature representation, and a
client-cloning strategy for scalable, privacy-preserving training.
FloraSyntropy-Net achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.38% on the
FloraSyntropy benchmark. Crucially, to validate its generalization capability,
we test the model on the unrelated multiclass Pest dataset, where it
demonstrates exceptional adaptability, achieving 99.84% accuracy. This work
provides not only a valuable new resource but also a robust and highly
generalizable framework that advances the field towards practical, large-scale
agricultural AI applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像数据具有动态演变的特性，传统VAD模型对输入数据分布随时间变化的影响关注不足，这种变化会显著降低模型性能。持续学习为增量适应模型同时保留已有知识提供了自然有效的框架。

Method: 使用持续学习版本的PatchCore模型(PatchCoreCL)，在具有图像级和像素级标注的真实医学影像数据集BMAD上进行评估。

Result: PatchCoreCL表现有效，性能与任务特定模型相当，遗忘值小于1%。

Conclusion: 研究证明了持续学习在医学影像自适应视觉异常检测中的可行性和潜力。

Abstract: Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) seeks to identify abnormal images and
precisely localize the corresponding anomalous regions, relying solely on
normal data during training. This approach has proven essential in domains such
as manufacturing and, more recently, in the medical field, where accurate and
explainable detection is critical. Despite its importance, the impact of
evolving input data distributions over time has received limited attention,
even though such changes can significantly degrade model performance. In
particular, given the dynamic and evolving nature of medical imaging data,
Continual Learning (CL) provides a natural and effective framework to
incrementally adapt models while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This
study explores for the first time the application of VAD models in a CL
scenario for the medical field. In this work, we utilize a CL version of the
well-established PatchCore model, called PatchCoreCL, and evaluate its
performance using BMAD, a real-world medical imaging dataset with both
image-level and pixel-level annotations. Our results demonstrate that
PatchCoreCL is an effective solution, achieving performance comparable to the
task-specific models, with a forgetting value less than a 1%, highlighting the
feasibility and potential of CL for adaptive VAD in medical imaging.

Motivation: 现有分割算法在处理严重临床病例（如冠状动脉狭窄和血管闭塞）时存在结构不连续问题，影响下游诊断准确性，需要重新连接不连续结构以确保完整性。

Method: 提出TSRNet网络，集成细节保留特征提取器、多重密集细化策略和全局到局部损失函数，确保准确重新连接的同时保持结构完整性。

Result: 在PC-CAC和两个额外公共数据集上的综合实验表明，该方法在多个评估指标上一致优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于点云的管状结构重建设立了新基准，相关数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Complex tubular structures are essential in medical imaging and
computer-assisted diagnosis, where their integrity enhances anatomical
visualization and lesion detection. However, existing segmentation algorithms
struggle with structural discontinuities, particularly in severe clinical cases
such as coronary artery stenosis and vessel occlusions, which leads to
undesired discontinuity and compromising downstream diagnostic accuracy.
Therefore, it is imperative to reconnect discontinuous structures to ensure
their completeness. In this study, we explore the tubular structure completion
based on point cloud for the first time and establish a Point Cloud-based
Coronary Artery Completion (PC-CAC) dataset, which is derived from real
clinical data. This dataset provides a novel benchmark for tubular structure
completion. Additionally, we propose TSRNet, a Tubular Structure Reconnection
Network that integrates a detail-preservated feature extractor, a multiple
dense refinement strategy, and a global-to-local loss function to ensure
accurate reconnection while maintaining structural integrity. Comprehensive
experiments on our PC-CAC and two additional public datasets (PC-ImageCAS and
PC-PTR) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, setting a new benchmark for
point cloud-based tubular structure reconstruction. Our benchmark is available

Abstract: Accurate detection of diseased glomeruli is fundamental to progress in renal
pathology and underpins the delivery of reliable clinical diagnoses. Although
recent advances in computer vision have produced increasingly sophisticated
detection algorithms, the majority of research efforts have focused on normal
glomeruli or instances of global sclerosis, leaving the wider spectrum of
diseased glomerular subtypes comparatively understudied. This disparity is not
without consequence; the nuanced and highly variable morphological
characteristics that define these disease variants frequently elude even the
most advanced computational models. Moreover, ongoing debate surrounds the
choice of optimal imaging magnifications and region-of-view dimensions for
fine-grained glomerular analysis, adding further complexity to the pursuit of
accurate classification and robust segmentation.
  To bridge these gaps, we present M^3-GloDet, a systematic framework designed
to enable thorough evaluation of detection models across a broad continuum of
regions, scales, and classes. Within this framework, we evaluate both
long-standing benchmark architectures and recently introduced state-of-the-art
models that have achieved notable performance, using an experimental design
that reflects the diversity of region-of-interest sizes and imaging resolutions
encountered in routine digital renal pathology. As the results, we found that
intermediate patch sizes offered the best balance between context and
efficiency. Additionally, moderate magnifications enhanced generalization by
reducing overfitting. Through systematic comparison of these approaches on a
multi-class diseased glomerular dataset, our aim is to advance the
understanding of model strengths and limitations, and to offer actionable
insights for the refinement of automated detection strategies and clinical
workflows in the digital pathology domain.

Motivation: CAM作为深度学习模型可视化的重要方法，其在不同噪声下的鲁棒性尚未得到充分探索，需要系统评估各种CAM方法对噪声扰动的敏感性。

Result: 研究发现不同CAM方法对噪声的敏感性存在显著差异，提出的鲁棒性度量指标能够有效捕捉CAM方法在噪声环境下的表现特性。

Conclusion: 该研究为CAM方法的鲁棒性评估提供了系统框架和量化指标，有助于理解不同CAM方法在噪声环境下的稳定性和可靠性。

Abstract: Class Activation Maps (CAMs) are one of the important methods for visualizing
regions used by deep learning models. Yet their robustness to different noise
remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate and report the resilience of
various CAM methods for different noise perturbations across multiple
architectures and datasets. By analyzing the influence of different noise types
on CAM explanations, we assess the susceptibility to noise and the extent to
which dataset characteristics may impact explanation stability. The findings
highlight considerable variability in noise sensitivity for various CAMs. We
propose a robustness metric for CAMs that captures two key properties:
consistency and responsiveness. Consistency reflects the ability of CAMs to
remain stable under input perturbations that do not alter the predicted class,
while responsiveness measures the sensitivity of CAMs to changes in the
prediction caused by such perturbations. The metric is evaluated empirically
across models, different perturbations, and datasets along with complementary
statistical tests to exemplify the applicability of our proposed approach.

quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms. We propose Language-Guided
Temporal Token Pruning (LGTTP), which leverages temporal cues from queries to
adaptively prune video tokens, preserving contextual continuity while reducing

retains higher token density in temporally relevant segments. Our

65% reduction in computation while preserving 97-99% of the original
performance. On QVHighlights, LGTTP improves HIT@1 by +9.5%, and on

Abstract: Memory decay makes it harder for the human brain to recognize visual objects
and retain details. Consequently, recorded brain signals become weaker,
uncertain, and contain poor visual context over time. This paper presents one
of the first vision-learning approaches to address this problem. First, we
statistically and experimentally demonstrate the existence of inconsistency in
brain signals and its impact on the Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) model. Our
findings show that brain signal representations shift over recording sessions,
leading to compounding bias, which poses challenges for model learning and
degrades performance. Then, we propose a new Bias-Mitigation Continual Learning
(BRAIN) approach to address these limitations. In this approach, the model is
trained in a continual learning setup and mitigates the growing bias from each
learning step. A new loss function named De-bias Contrastive Learning is also
introduced to address the bias problem. In addition, to prevent catastrophic
forgetting, where the model loses knowledge from previous sessions, the new
Angular-based Forgetting Mitigation approach is introduced to preserve learned
knowledge in the model. Finally, the empirical experiments demonstrate that our
approach achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance across various
benchmarks, surpassing prior and non-continual learning methods.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an essential component
of medical imaging research, aiming to increase transparency and clinical trust
in deep learning models. This study investigates brain hemorrhage diagnosis
with a focus on explainability through Class Activation Mapping (CAM)
techniques. A pipeline was developed to extract pixellevel segmentation and
detection annotations from classification models using nine state-of-the-art
CAM algorithms, applied across multiple network stages, and quantitatively
evaluated on the Hemorica dataset, which uniquely provides both slice-level
labels and high-quality segmentation masks. Metrics including Dice, IoU, and
pixel-wise overlap were employed to benchmark CAM variants. Results show that
the strongest localization performance occurred at stage 5 of EfficientNetV2S,
with HiResCAM yielding the highest bounding-box alignment and AblationCAM
achieving the best pixel-level Dice (0.57) and IoU (0.40), representing strong
accuracy given that models were trained solely for classification without
segmentation supervision. To the best of current knowledge, this is among the f
irst works to quantitatively compare CAM methods for brain hemorrhage
detection, establishing a reproducible benchmark and underscoring the potential
of XAI-driven pipelines for clinically meaningful AI-assisted diagnosis.

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision (CV), achieving outstanding
performance in classification, segmentation, and related tasks. Such AI-based
CV systems are becoming prevalent, with applications spanning from medical
imaging to surveillance. State of the art models such as convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) are often regarded as ``black
boxes,'' offering limited transparency into their decision-making processes.
Despite a recent advancement in explainable AI (XAI), explainability remains
underutilized in practical CV deployments. A primary obstacle is the absence of
integrated software solutions that connect XAI techniques with robust knowledge
management and monitoring frameworks. To close this gap, we have developed Obz
AI, a comprehensive software ecosystem designed to facilitate state-of-the-art
explainability and observability for vision AI systems. Obz AI provides a
seamless integration pipeline, from a Python client library to a full-stack
analytics dashboard. With Obz AI, a machine learning engineer can easily
incorporate advanced XAI methodologies, extract and analyze features for
outlier detection, and continuously monitor AI models in real time. By making
the decision-making mechanisms of deep models interpretable, Obz AI promotes
observability and responsible deployment of computer vision systems.

### [148] [CATformer: Contrastive Adversarial Transformer for Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17708)
*Qinyi Tian,Spence Cox,Laura E. Dalton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CATformer是一种结合扩散模型、对抗学习和对比学习的超分辨率Transformer网络，通过双分支架构和特征融合，在效率和图像质量上优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超分辨率技术需要提升低分辨率图像质量，现有方法在transformer、扩散模型和GAN之间存在性能差距，需要一种综合方案来弥合这一差距

Method: 采用双分支Transformer架构：主分支使用扩散启发的transformer逐步精炼潜在表示，辅助分支通过学习的潜在对比增强噪声鲁棒性，最后使用残差密集块进行特征融合和重建

Result: 在基准数据集上的大量实验表明，CATformer在效率和视觉图像质量方面均优于最近的transformer基和扩散启发方法

Conclusion: 该工作弥合了transformer、扩散和GAN基方法之间的性能差距，为扩散启发transformer在超分辨率中的实际应用奠定了基础

Abstract: Super-resolution remains a promising technique to enhance the quality of
low-resolution images. This study introduces CATformer (Contrastive Adversarial
Transformer), a novel neural network integrating diffusion-inspired feature
refinement with adversarial and contrastive learning. CATformer employs a
dual-branch architecture combining a primary diffusion-inspired transformer,
which progressively refines latent representations, with an auxiliary
transformer branch designed to enhance robustness to noise through learned
latent contrasts. These complementary representations are fused and decoded
using deep Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks for enhanced reconstruction
quality. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CATformer
outperforms recent transformer-based and diffusion-inspired methods both in
efficiency and visual image quality. This work bridges the performance gap
among transformer-, diffusion-, and GAN-based methods, laying a foundation for
practical applications of diffusion-inspired transformers in super-resolution.

TL;DR: NGD方法通过神经梯度变形和自适应网格重划分技术，从单目视频中高质量重建动态服装，解决了现有方法在细节建模和变形处理上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法在服装动态重建中存在局限性：隐式表示方法无法建模高频细节，模板重建方法使用顶点位移导致伪影。需要一种能够处理复杂服装动态并保持高质量细节的方法。

Method: 提出神经梯度变形方法(NGD)，结合自适应网格重划分策略来建模动态演化的表面细节（如褶皱），并学习动态纹理贴图来捕捉每帧的光照和阴影效果。

Result: 通过广泛的定性和定量评估，证明该方法相比现有最先进方法有显著改进，能够提供高质量的服装重建结果。

Conclusion: NGD方法成功解决了动态服装重建中的关键挑战，通过创新的变形和网格处理技术实现了高质量的细节保留和动态效果捕捉。

Abstract: Dynamic garment reconstruction from monocular video is an important yet
challenging task due to the complex dynamics and unconstrained nature of the
garments. Recent advancements in neural rendering have enabled high-quality
geometric reconstruction with image/video supervision. However, implicit
representation methods that use volume rendering often provide smooth geometry
and fail to model high-frequency details. While template reconstruction methods
model explicit geometry, they use vertex displacement for deformation, which
results in artifacts. Addressing these limitations, we propose NGD, a Neural
Gradient-based Deformation method to reconstruct dynamically evolving textured
garments from monocular videos. Additionally, we propose a novel adaptive
remeshing strategy for modelling dynamically evolving surfaces like wrinkles
and pleats of the skirt, leading to high-quality reconstruction. Finally, we
learn dynamic texture maps to capture per-frame lighting and shadow effects. We
provide extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate
significant improvements over existing SOTA methods and provide high-quality
garment reconstructions.

Result: F2RVLM在领域内和实际场景中都超越了常见的多模态语言模型，显示出更优秀的检索性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为长对话中的细粒度多模态内容检索提供了有效解决方案，F2RVLM模型通过结构化训练方法显著提升了检索的准确性和语义一致性。

Abstract: Traditional dialogue retrieval aims to select the most appropriate utterance
or image from recent dialogue history. However, they often fail to meet users'
actual needs for revisiting semantically coherent content scattered across
long-form conversations. To fill this gap, we define the Fine-grained Fragment
Retrieval (FFR) task, requiring models to locate query-relevant fragments,
comprising both utterances and images, from multimodal long-form dialogues. As
a foundation for FFR, we construct MLDR, the longest-turn multimodal dialogue
retrieval dataset to date, averaging 25.45 turns per dialogue, with each
naturally spanning three distinct topics. To evaluate generalization in
real-world scenarios, we curate and annotate a WeChat-based test set comprising
real-world multimodal dialogues with an average of 75.38 turns. Building on
these resources, we explore existing generation-based Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) on FFR and observe that they often retrieve incoherent utterance-image
fragments. While optimized for generating responses from visual-textual inputs,
these models lack explicit supervision to ensure semantic coherence within
retrieved fragments. To this end, we propose F2RVLM, a generative retrieval
model trained in a two-stage paradigm: (1) supervised fine-tuning to inject
fragment-level retrieval knowledge, and (2) GRPO-based reinforcement learning
with multi-objective rewards promoting semantic precision, relevance, and
contextual coherence. To handle varying intra-fragment complexity, from locally
dense to sparsely distributed, we introduce difficulty-aware curriculum
sampling that ranks training instances by model-predicted difficulty and
gradually exposes the model to harder samples. This boosts reasoning ability in
long, multi-turn contexts. F2RVLM outperforms popular VLMs in both in-domain
and real-domain settings, demonstrating superior retrieval performance.

TL;DR: 提出统一的人类动作异常检测框架，通过对比学习和扩散模型增强，实现少样本场景下的跨类别泛化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法需要为每个动作类别单独训练模型且需要大量正常样本的问题，提高在数据稀缺和新类别频繁出现的真实场景中的适用性

Method: 构建类别无关的表示空间（对比学习）+ 生成式运动增强策略（基于扩散模型生成多样化训练样本）+ 支持集比较进行异常检测

Result: 在HumanAct12数据集上取得最先进效果，在已见和未见类别设置下都表现优异，训练效率和模型可扩展性显著提升

Conclusion: 该方法为少样本人类动作异常检测提供了有效的统一框架，通过对比学习和生成增强策略实现了更好的泛化能力和实用性

Abstract: Human Action Anomaly Detection (HAAD) aims to identify anomalous actions
given only normal action data during training. Existing methods typically
follow a one-model-per-category paradigm, requiring separate training for each
action category and a large number of normal samples. These constraints hinder
scalability and limit applicability in real-world scenarios, where data is
often scarce or novel categories frequently appear. To address these
limitations, we propose a unified framework for HAAD that is compatible with
few-shot scenarios. Our method constructs a category-agnostic representation
space via contrastive learning, enabling AD by comparing test samples with a
given small set of normal examples (referred to as the support set). To improve
inter-category generalization and intra-category robustness, we introduce a
generative motion augmentation strategy harnessing a diffusion-based foundation
model for creating diverse and realistic training samples. Notably, to the best
of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce such a strategy
specifically tailored to enhance contrastive learning for action AD. Extensive
experiments on the HumanAct12 dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art
effectiveness of our approach under both seen and unseen category settings,
regarding training efficiency and model scalability for few-shot HAAD.

TL;DR: 提出结合U-Net分割和分类模型的深度学习框架用于宫颈细胞Pap涂片分析，发现分割对分类性能提升有限但略有改善


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 宫颈癌是女性癌症死亡的主要原因，Pap涂片手动检查耗时且易出错，需要自动化辅助诊断工具

Method: 使用Herlev数据集，比较基于分割图像和未分割图像训练的分类模型性能，评估分割对分类的影响

Result: 分割图像使精确度提高约0.41%，F1分数提高约1.30%，但整体影响有限

Conclusion: 分割有助于特征提取但对分类性能提升有限，该框架可作为临床辅助工具帮助病理学家早期诊断

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant global health concern and a leading
cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Early detection through Pap smear
tests is essential to reduce mortality rates; however, the manual examination
is time consuming and prone to human error. This study proposes a deep learning
framework that integrates U-Net for segmentation and a classification model to
enhance diagnostic performance. The Herlev Pap Smear Dataset, a publicly
available cervical cell dataset, was utilized for training and evaluation. The
impact of segmentation on classification performance was evaluated by comparing
the model trained on segmented images and another trained on non-segmented
images. Experimental results showed that the use of segmented images marginally
improved the model performance on precision (about 0.41 percent higher) and
F1-score (about 1.30 percent higher), which suggests a slightly more balanced
classification performance. While segmentation helps in feature extraction, the
results showed that its impact on classification performance appears to be
limited. The proposed framework offers a supplemental tool for clinical
applications, which may aid pathologists in early diagnosis.

TL;DR: CMFDNet是一种创新的结肠息肉分割架构，通过CMD、MSA和FD三个模块解决息肉形状大小变异、边界模糊和小息肉漏检问题，在多个数据集上超越现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结肠息肉分割方法面临三个主要挑战：(1)息肉形状和大小差异显著，(2)息肉与相邻组织边界模糊，(3)小尺寸息肉容易被忽略。这些实际问题驱动了新型架构的开发。

Method: 提出CMFDNet架构，包含三个核心模块：CMD模块作为创新解码器，采用交叉扫描方法减少模糊边界；MSA模块采用多分支并行结构增强对不同几何形状和尺度分布的识别能力；FD模块建立所有解码器特征间的依赖关系以缓解小尺度息肉的漏检问题。

Result: 实验结果表明CMFDNet优于六种最先进的对比方法，特别是在ETIS和ColonDB数据集上，mDice分数分别比最佳SOTA方法高出1.83%和1.55%。

Conclusion: CMFDNet通过其创新的模块设计有效解决了结肠息肉分割中的关键挑战，在多个基准数据集上取得了显著的性能提升，证明了该方法在辅助医生进行结直肠肿瘤筛查和诊断中的实用价值。

Abstract: Automated colonic polyp segmentation is crucial for assisting doctors in
screening of precancerous polyps and diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms.
Although existing methods have achieved promising results, polyp segmentation
remains hindered by the following limitations,including: (1) significant
variation in polyp shapes and sizes, (2) indistinct boundaries between polyps
and adjacent tissues, and (3) small-sized polyps are easily overlooked during
the segmentation process. Driven by these practical difficulties, an innovative
architecture, CMFDNet, is proposed with the CMD module, MSA module, and FD
module. The CMD module, serving as an innovative decoder, introduces a
cross-scanning method to reduce blurry boundaries. The MSA module adopts a
multi-branch parallel structure to enhance the recognition ability for polyps
with diverse geometries and scale distributions. The FD module establishes
dependencies among all decoder features to alleviate the under-detection of
polyps with small-scale features. Experimental results show that CMFDNet
outperforms six SOTA methods used for comparison, especially on ETIS and
ColonDB datasets, where mDice scores exceed the best SOTA method by 1.83% and
1.55%, respectively.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D pose of a drone is important for anti-drone systems, but
existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of drone keypoint
detection. Drone propellers serve as keypoints but are difficult to detect due
to their high visual similarity and diversity of poses. To address these
challenges, we propose DroneKey, a framework that combines a 2D keypoint
detector and a 3D pose estimator specifically designed for drones. In the
keypoint detection stage, we extract two key-representations (intermediate and
compact) from each transformer encoder layer and optimally combine them using a
gated sum. We also introduce a pose-adaptive Mahalanobis distance in the loss
function to ensure stable keypoint predictions across extreme poses. We built
new datasets of drone 2D keypoints and 3D pose to train and evaluate our
method, which have been publicly released. Experiments show that our method
achieves an AP of 99.68% (OKS) in keypoint detection, outperforming existing
methods. Ablation studies confirm that the pose-adaptive Mahalanobis loss
function improves keypoint prediction stability and accuracy. Additionally,
improvements in the encoder design enable real-time processing at 44 FPS. For
3D pose estimation, our method achieved an MAE-angle of 10.62{\deg}, an RMSE of
0.221m, and an MAE-absolute of 0.076m, demonstrating high accuracy and
reliability. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 本文通过实证分析研究了CLIP预训练模型中的社会偏见如何传播到下游任务，发现偏见测量高度依赖数据子集，预训练偏见与下游任务偏见之间缺乏一致相关性，且不同CLIP模型在下游任务适应时表征空间趋于收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CLIP预训练模型被广泛用于下游任务，需要深入分析其迁移性影响，特别是这些模型记载的社会偏见和人类刻板印象如何传播到视觉问答、图像字幕等下游应用中。

Method: 通过全面的实证分析：1) 检查预训练偏见在全局和局部数据视图中的变化；2) 分析不同预训练偏见水平下预训练模型与下游任务偏见之间的相关性；3) 探索偏见不一致的原因，研究当前范式下不同预训练CLIP模型在下游任务适应时的表征空间收敛情况。

Result: 研究发现偏见测量高度依赖计算所用的数据子集；预训练偏见与下游任务偏见之间难以发现一致的趋势；不同预训练CLIP模型在下游任务适应时表征空间趋于收敛，这解释了偏见不一致的现象。

Conclusion: 这项工作为偏见行为提供了有价值的见解，希望为未来研究提供信息以促进更好的偏见缓解实践，强调了当前偏见转移研究范式的局限性。

Abstract: The recycling of contrastive language-image pre-trained (CLIP) models as
backbones for a large number of downstream tasks calls for a thorough analysis
of their transferability implications, especially their well-documented
reproduction of social biases and human stereotypes. How do such biases,
learned during pre-training, propagate to downstream applications like visual
question answering or image captioning? Do they transfer at all?
  We investigate this phenomenon, referred to as bias transfer in prior
literature, through a comprehensive empirical analysis. Firstly, we examine how
pre-training bias varies between global and local views of data, finding that
bias measurement is highly dependent on the subset of data on which it is
computed. Secondly, we analyze correlations between biases in the pre-trained
models and the downstream tasks across varying levels of pre-training bias,
finding difficulty in discovering consistent trends in bias transfer. Finally,
we explore why this inconsistency occurs, showing that under the current
paradigm, representation spaces of different pre-trained CLIPs tend to converge
when adapted for downstream tasks. We hope this work offers valuable insights
into bias behavior and informs future research to promote better bias
mitigation practices.

Conclusion: RAD框架对噪声训练条件具有卓越的鲁棒性，能够检测各种工业场景中的细微异常，是实际应用中数据标注不完美情况下的实用解决方案

Abstract: Anomaly detection is fundamental for ensuring quality control and operational
efficiency in industrial environments, yet conventional approaches face
significant challenges when training data contains mislabeled samples-a common
occurrence in real-world scenarios. This paper presents RAD, a robust anomaly
detection framework that integrates Normalizing Flows with Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning to address the critical challenge of label noise in industrial
settings. Our approach employs a bi-level optimization strategy where
meta-learning enables rapid adaptation to varying noise conditions, while
uncertainty quantification guides adaptive L2 regularization to maintain model
stability. The framework incorporates multiscale feature processing through
pretrained feature extractors and leverages the precise likelihood estimation
capabilities of Normalizing Flows for robust anomaly scoring. Comprehensive
evaluation on MVTec-AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrates superior performance,
achieving I-AUROC scores of 95.4% and 94.6% respectively under clean
conditions, while maintaining robust detection capabilities above 86.8% and
92.1% even when 50% of training samples are mislabeled. The results highlight
RAD's exceptional resilience to noisy training conditions and its ability to
detect subtle anomalies across diverse industrial scenarios, making it a
practical solution for real-world anomaly detection applications where perfect
data curation is challenging.

Abstract: The most popular networks used for cell segmentation (e.g. Cellpose,
Stardist, HoverNet,...) rely on a prediction of a distance map. It yields
unprecedented accuracy but hinges on fully annotated datasets. This is a
serious limitation to generate training sets and perform transfer learning. In
this paper, we propose a method that still relies on the distance map and
handles partially annotated objects. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed approach in the contexts of frugal learning, transfer learning and
regular learning on regular databases. Our experiments show that it can lead to
substantial savings in time and resources without sacrificing segmentation
quality. The proposed algorithm is embedded in a user-friendly Napari plugin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型中视觉token数量远多于文本token，视觉token剪枝可降低计算成本。但序列模型存在近因偏差，导致图像底部区域的token获得过高注意力分数，造成次优剪枝

Method: 提出位置重加权视觉token剪枝方法，根据视觉token在图像中的空间位置调整其注意力分数，无需改变模型架构或额外训练

Result: 在LVLMs上的大量实验表明，该方法以最小计算开销提升了视觉token剪枝的性能

Conclusion: 该方法是一个即插即用的解决方案，可无缝集成到现有视觉token剪枝框架中，有效缓解近因偏差问题

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically process a significantly larger number
of visual tokens compared to text tokens due to the inherent redundancy in
visual signals. Visual token pruning is a promising direction to reduce the
computational cost of VLMs by eliminating redundant visual tokens. The
text-visual attention score is a widely adopted criterion for visual token
pruning as it reflects the relevance of visual tokens to the text input.
However, many sequence models exhibit a recency bias, where tokens appearing
later in the sequence exert a disproportionately large influence on the model's
output. In VLMs, this bias manifests as inflated attention scores for tokens
corresponding to the lower regions of the image, leading to suboptimal pruning
that disproportionately retains tokens from the image bottom. In this paper, we
present an extremely simple yet effective approach to alleviate the recency
bias in visual token pruning. We propose a straightforward reweighting
mechanism that adjusts the attention scores of visual tokens according to their
spatial positions in the image. Our method, termed Position-reweighted Visual
Token Pruning, is a plug-and-play solution that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing visual token pruning frameworks without any changes to the model
architecture or extra training. Extensive experiments on LVLMs demonstrate that
our method improves the performance of visual token pruning with minimal
computational overhead.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了视频融合中的时序一致性问题，在视觉保真度、语义准确性和时序一致性方面均表现出色

Abstract: Existing multi-modal fusion methods typically apply static frame-based image
fusion techniques directly to video fusion tasks, neglecting inherent temporal
dependencies and leading to inconsistent results across frames. To address this
limitation, we propose the first video fusion framework that explicitly
incorporates temporal modeling with visual-semantic collaboration to
simultaneously ensure visual fidelity, semantic accuracy, and temporal
consistency. First, we introduce a visual-semantic interaction module
consisting of a semantic branch and a visual branch, with Dinov2 and VGG19
employed for targeted distillation, allowing simultaneous enhancement of both
the visual and semantic representations. Second, we pioneer integrate the video
degradation enhancement task into the video fusion pipeline by constructing a
temporal cooperative module, which leverages temporal dependencies to
facilitate weak information recovery. Third, to ensure temporal consistency, we
embed a temporal-enhanced mechanism into the network and devise a temporal loss
to guide the optimization process. Finally, we introduce two innovative
evaluation metrics tailored for video fusion, aimed at assessing the temporal
consistency of the generated fused videos. Extensive experimental results on
public video datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code is

Abstract: Industrial and medical anomaly detection faces critical challenges from data
scarcity and prohibitive annotation costs, particularly in evolving
manufacturing and healthcare settings. To address this, we propose CoZAD, a
novel zero-shot anomaly detection framework that integrates soft confident
learning with meta-learning and contrastive feature representation. Unlike
traditional confident learning that discards uncertain samples, our method
assigns confidence-based weights to all training data, preserving boundary
information while emphasizing prototypical normal patterns. The framework
quantifies data uncertainty through IQR-based thresholding and model
uncertainty via covariance based regularization within a Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning. Contrastive learning creates discriminative feature spaces where
normal patterns form compact clusters, enabling rapid domain adaptation.
Comprehensive evaluation across 10 datasets spanning industrial and medical
domains demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods on 6 out of 7 industrial benchmarks with notable improvements on
texture-rich datasets (99.2% I-AUROC on DTD-Synthetic, 97.2% on BTAD) and

dependence on vision-language alignments or model ensembles, making it valuable
for resourceconstrained environments requiring rapid deployment.

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene generation is crucial for virtual reality, interior
design, embodied intelligence, and scene understanding. While existing methods
have made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to
capture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of
generated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and
detailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these
issues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for
fine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine
hierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture
placement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained
layout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and
horizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into
multiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization
network addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation
errors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically
plausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating
realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the
field of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications
requiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication
to encourage future research.

Conclusion: SCOUT方法有效提升了半监督伪装目标检测的性能，通过更好的未标注数据利用和文本信息融合取得了显著改进

Abstract: The difficulty of pixel-level annotation has significantly hindered the
development of the Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) field. To save on
annotation costs, previous works leverage the semi-supervised COD framework
that relies on a small number of labeled data and a large volume of unlabeled
data. We argue that there is still significant room for improvement in the
effective utilization of unlabeled data. To this end, we introduce a
Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection by Utilizing Text and Adaptive
Data Selection (SCOUT). It includes an Adaptive Data Augment and Selection
(ADAS) module and a Text Fusion Module (TFM). The ADSA module selects valuable
data for annotation through an adversarial augment and sampling strategy. The
TFM module further leverages the selected valuable data by combining
camouflage-related knowledge and text-visual interaction. To adapt to this
work, we build a new dataset, namely RefTextCOD. Extensive experiments show
that the proposed method surpasses previous semi-supervised methods in the COD
field and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released at
https://github.com/Heartfirey/SCOUT.

Conclusion: DiffAug框架通过文本引导的扩散生成和自动验证机制，有效解决了医学图像分割中罕见异常数据稀缺的问题，显著提升了分割性能，特别是在早期筛查应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models struggle with rare abnormalities due to
scarce annotated pathological data. We propose DiffAug a novel framework that
combines textguided diffusion-based generation with automatic segmentation
validation to address this challenge. Our proposed approach uses latent
diffusion models conditioned on medical text descriptions and spatial masks to
synthesize abnormalities via inpainting on normal images. Generated samples
undergo dynamic quality validation through a latentspace segmentation network
that ensures accurate localization while enabling single-step inference. The
text prompts, derived from medical literature, guide the generation of diverse
abnormality types without requiring manual annotation. Our validation mechanism
filters synthetic samples based on spatial accuracy, maintaining quality while
operating efficiently through direct latent estimation. Evaluated on three
medical imaging benchmarks (CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, REFUGE2), our framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance with 8-10% Dice improvements over
baselines and reduces false negative rates by up to 28% for challenging cases
like small polyps and flat lesions critical for early detection in screening
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ATLaS方法，通过交替训练使用标准one-hot标签和标签平滑生成的软标签来监督提示调优，解决了传统标签平滑在提示调优中泛化能力下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在零样本泛化方面表现出色，但提示调优的泛化能力有限。标签平滑作为有效的正则化技术可以防止模型过拟合，但传统方法在提示调优中反而会削弱泛化能力。

Method: 提出交替训练标签平滑(ATLaS)方法，交替使用标准one-hot标签和软标签进行训练。引入两种离线软标签：类级软标签(CSL)和实例级软标签(ISL)，为提示调优提供类间或实例-类关系。

Result: 大量实验表明，ATLaS方法结合CSL和ISL能够持续提升提示调优的泛化性能，且与主流提示调优方法具有高度兼容性。

Conclusion: ATLaS方法有效解决了标签平滑在提示调优中的负面效应，通过交替训练策略和两种软标签设计显著提升了模型的泛化能力，具有很好的实用性和兼容性。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. To further enhance these
models' adaptability to various downstream tasks, prompt tuning has emerged as
a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, despite its efficiency, the
generalization ability of prompt remains limited. In contrast, label smoothing
(LS) has been widely recognized as an effective regularization technique that
prevents models from becoming over-confident and improves their generalization.
This inspires us to explore the integration of LS with prompt tuning. However,
we have observed that the vanilla LS even weakens the generalization ability of
prompt tuning. To address this issue, we propose the Alternating Training-based
Label Smoothing (ATLaS) method, which alternately trains with standard one-hot
labels and soft labels generated by LS to supervise the prompt tuning.
Moreover, we introduce two types of efficient offline soft labels, including
Class-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL), to provide
inter-class or instance-class relationships for prompt tuning. The theoretical
properties of the proposed ATLaS method are analyzed. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed ATLaS method, combined with CSL and ISL,
consistently enhances the generalization performance of prompt tuning.
Moreover, the proposed ATLaS method exhibits high compatibility with prevalent
prompt tuning methods, enabling seamless integration into existing methods.

Motivation: 目标检测需要昂贵的边界框标注，主动学习可以减轻标注负担。框级主动学习比图像级更高效，但早期模型在少数类别上表现不佳，导致伪标签严重类别不平衡。

Method: 1. 类别平衡采样策略：选择更多少数类别的对象进行标注；2. 任务感知软伪标签策略：提高伪标签的准确性

Result: 在公共基准数据集上评估，方法达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 通过类别平衡采样和软伪标签策略，有效解决了框级主动学习中的类别不平衡问题，提升了目标检测模型的性能

Abstract: Training deep object detectors demands expensive bounding box annotation.
Active learning (AL) is a promising technique to alleviate the annotation
burden. Performing AL at box-level for object detection, i.e., selecting the
most informative boxes to label and supplementing the sparsely-labelled image
with pseudo labels, has been shown to be more cost-effective than selecting and
labelling the entire image. In box-level AL for object detection, we observe
that models at early stage can only perform well on majority classes, making
the pseudo labels severely class-imbalanced. We propose a class-balanced
sampling strategy to select more objects from minority classes for labelling,
so as to make the final training data, \ie, ground truth labels obtained by AL
and pseudo labels, more class-balanced to train a better model. We also propose
a task-aware soft pseudo labelling strategy to increase the accuracy of pseudo
labels. We evaluate our method on public benchmarking datasets and show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: GS-SMC是一种基于3D高斯泼溅的相机位姿优化框架，通过利用现有3DGS模型渲染多视角图像，结合对极几何约束进行迭代优化，无需重新训练即可应用于不同场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有相机位姿优化方法要么依赖特定描述符或需要重新训练网络，要么缺乏几何约束导致精度不足。需要一种轻量级、无需重新训练且能保持几何精度的解决方案。

Method: 利用现有3DGS模型渲染多视角图像，采用迭代优化方法，通过对极几何约束在查询图像和渲染图像之间建立特征匹配，灵活选择特征提取器和匹配器。

Result: 在7-Scenes和Cambridge Landmarks数据集上显著优于现有方法，分别减少中位平移误差53.3%和40.7%，中位旋转误差56.9%和53.2%。

Conclusion: GS-SMC提供了一种无需重新训练、轻量级且高精度的相机位姿优化方案，能够直接应用于各种场景，在精度和实用性方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Camera pose refinement aims at improving the accuracy of initial pose
estimation for applications in 3D computer vision. Most refinement approaches
rely on 2D-3D correspondences with specific descriptors or dedicated networks,
requiring reconstructing the scene again for a different descriptor or fully
retraining the network for each scene. Some recent methods instead infer pose
from feature similarity, but their lack of geometry constraints results in less
accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel camera pose
refinement framework leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), referred to as
GS-SMC. Given the widespread usage of 3DGS, our method can employ an existing
3DGS model to render novel views, providing a lightweight solution that can be
directly applied to diverse scenes without additional training or fine-tuning.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative optimization approach, which refines
the camera pose using epipolar geometric constraints among the query and
multiple rendered images. Our method allows flexibly choosing feature
extractors and matchers to establish these constraints. Extensive empirical
evaluations on the 7-Scenes and the Cambridge Landmarks datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art camera pose refinement approaches,
achieving 53.3% and 56.9% reductions in median translation and rotation errors
on 7-Scenes, and 40.7% and 53.2% on Cambridge.

Conclusion: ISALux通过有效整合光照和语义先验，在低光照图像增强任务中表现出色，为解决真实场景中的光照变化和结构变化提供了有效方案。

Abstract: We introduce ISALux, a novel transformer-based approach for Low-Light Image
Enhancement (LLIE) that seamlessly integrates illumination and semantic priors.
Our architecture includes an original self-attention block, Hybrid Illumination
and Semantics-Aware Multi-Headed Self- Attention (HISA-MSA), which integrates
illumination and semantic segmentation maps for en- hanced feature extraction.
ISALux employs two self-attention modules to independently process illumination
and semantic features, selectively enriching each other to regulate luminance
and high- light structural variations in real-world scenarios. A Mixture of
Experts (MoE)-based Feed-Forward Network (FFN) enhances contextual learning,
with a gating mechanism conditionally activating the top K experts for
specialized processing. To address overfitting in LLIE methods caused by
distinct light patterns in benchmarking datasets, we enhance the HISA-MSA
module with low-rank matrix adaptations (LoRA). Extensive qualitative and
quantitative evaluations across multiple specialized datasets demonstrate that
ISALux is competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Addition- ally, an
ablation study highlights the contribution of each component in the proposed
model. Code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Prompting is fundamental to unlocking the full potential of large language
models. To automate and enhance this process, automatic prompt optimization
(APO) has been developed, demonstrating effectiveness primarily in text-only
input scenarios. However, extending existing APO methods to multimodal tasks,
such as video-language generation introduces two core challenges: (i) visual
token inflation, where long visual token sequences restrict context capacity
and result in insufficient feedback signals; (ii) a lack of process-level
supervision, as existing methods focus on outcome-level supervision and
overlook intermediate supervision, limiting prompt optimization. We present
UniAPO: Unified Multimodal Automated Prompt Optimization, the first framework
tailored for multimodal APO. UniAPO adopts an EM-inspired optimization process
that decouples feedback modeling and prompt refinement, making the optimization
more stable and goal-driven. To further address the aforementioned challenges,
we introduce a short-long term memory mechanism: historical feedback mitigates
context limitations, while historical prompts provide directional guidance for
effective prompt optimization. UniAPO achieves consistent gains across text,
image, and video benchmarks, establishing a unified framework for efficient and
transferable prompt optimization.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a foundational component for 3D reconstruction in
minimally invasive endoscopic surgeries. However, existing monocular depth
estimation techniques often exhibit limited performance to the varying
illumination and complex textures of the surgical environment. While powerful
visual foundation models offer a promising solution, their training on natural
images leads to significant domain adaptability limitations and semantic
perception deficiencies when applied to endoscopy. In this study, we introduce
EndoUFM, an unsupervised monocular depth estimation framework that innovatively
integrating dual foundation models for surgical scenes, which enhance the depth
estimation performance by leveraging the powerful pre-learned priors. The
framework features a novel adaptive fine-tuning strategy that incorporates
Random Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (RVLoRA) to enhance model adaptability, and a
Residual block based on Depthwise Separable Convolution (Res-DSC) to improve
the capture of fine-grained local features. Furthermore, we design a
mask-guided smoothness loss to enforce depth consistency within anatomical
tissue structures. Extensive experiments on the SCARED, Hamlyn, SERV-CT, and
EndoNeRF datasets confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
while maintaining an efficient model size. This work contributes to augmenting
surgeons' spatial perception during minimally invasive procedures, thereby
enhancing surgical precision and safety, with crucial implications for
augmented reality and navigation systems.

Abstract: Progress in remote PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (rPPG) is limited by the critical
issues of existing publicly available datasets: small size, privacy concerns
with facial videos, and lack of diversity in conditions. The paper introduces a
novel comprehensive large-scale multi-view video dataset for rPPG and health
biomarkers estimation. Our dataset comprises 3600 synchronized video recordings

analysis of physiological states, each recording is paired with a 100 Hz PPG
signal and extended health metrics, such as electrocardiogram, arterial blood
pressure, biomarkers, temperature, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and
stress level. Using this data, we train an efficient rPPG model and compare its
quality with existing approaches in cross-dataset scenarios. The public release
of our dataset and model should significantly speed up the progress in the

Abstract: This study aims to investigate the effect of various beam geometries and
dimensions of input data on the sparse-sampling streak artifact correction task
with U-Nets for clinical CT scans as a means of incorporating the volumetric
context into artifact reduction tasks to improve model performance. A total of
22 subjects were retrospectively selected (01.2016-12.2018) from the Technical
University of Munich's research hospital, TUM Klinikum rechts der Isar.
Sparsely-sampled CT volumes were simulated with the Astra toolbox for parallel,
fan, and cone beam geometries. 2048 views were taken as full-view scans. 2D and
3D U-Nets were trained and validated on 14, and tested on 8 subjects,
respectively. For the dimensionality study, in addition to the 512x512 2D CT
images, the CT scans were further pre-processed to generate a so-called '2.5D',
and 3D data: Each CT volume was divided into 64x64x64 voxel blocks. The 3D data
refers to individual 64-voxel blocks. An axial, coronal, and sagittal cut
through the center of each block resulted in three 64x64 2D patches that were
rearranged as a single 64x64x3 image, proposed as 2.5D data. Model performance
was assessed with the mean squared error (MSE) and structural similarity index
measure (SSIM). For all geometries, the 2D U-Net trained on axial 2D slices
results in the best MSE and SSIM values, outperforming the 2.5D and 3D input
data dimensions.

Abstract: Scene regression methods, such as VGGT, solve the Structure-from-Motion (SfM)
problem by directly regressing camera poses and 3D scene structures from input
images. They demonstrate impressive performance in handling images under
extreme viewpoint changes. However, these methods struggle to handle a large
number of input images. To address this problem, we introduce SAIL-Recon, a
feed-forward Transformer for large scale SfM, by augmenting the scene
regression network with visual localization capabilities. Specifically, our
method first computes a neural scene representation from a subset of anchor
images. The regression network is then fine-tuned to reconstruct all input
images conditioned on this neural scene representation. Comprehensive
experiments show that our method not only scales efficiently to large-scale
scenes, but also achieves state-of-the-art results on both camera pose
estimation and novel view synthesis benchmarks, including TUM-RGBD, CO3Dv2, and
Tanks & Temples. We will publish our model and code. Code and models are

Abstract: The use of computer vision in automotive is a trending research in which
safety and security are a primary concern. In particular, for autonomous
driving, preventing road accidents requires highly accurate object detection
under diverse conditions. To address this issue, recently the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) released the 8800 norm, providing
structured frameworks for managing associated AI relevant risks. However,
challenging scenarios such as adverse weather or low lighting often introduce
data drift, leading to degraded model performance and potential safety
violations. In this work, we present a novel hybrid computer vision
architecture trained with thousands of synthetic image data from the road
environment to improve robustness in unseen drifted environments. Our dual mode
framework utilized YOLO version 8 for swift detection and incorporated a
five-layer CNN for verification. The system functioned in sequence and improved
the detection accuracy by more than 90\% when tested with drift-augmented road
images. The focus was to demonstrate how such a hybrid model can provide better
road safety when working together in a hybrid structure.

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of image manipulation techniques demands robust
forensic solutions that can both reliably detect alterations and precisely
localize tampered regions. Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show
promise by leveraging world knowledge and semantic understanding for
context-aware detection, yet they struggle with perceiving subtle, low-level
forensic artifacts crucial for accurate manipulation localization. This paper
presents a novel Propose-Rectify framework that effectively bridges semantic
reasoning with forensic-specific analysis. In the proposal stage, our approach
utilizes a forensic-adapted LLaVA model to generate initial manipulation
analysis and preliminary localization of suspicious regions based on semantic
understanding and contextual reasoning. In the rectification stage, we
introduce a Forensics Rectification Module that systematically validates and
refines these initial proposals through multi-scale forensic feature analysis,
integrating technical evidence from several specialized filters. Additionally,
we present an Enhanced Segmentation Module that incorporates critical forensic
cues into SAM's encoded image embeddings, thereby overcoming inherent semantic
biases to achieve precise delineation of manipulated regions. By
synergistically combining advanced multimodal reasoning with established
forensic methodologies, our framework ensures that initial semantic proposals
are systematically validated and enhanced through concrete technical evidence,
resulting in comprehensive detection accuracy and localization precision.
Extensive experimental validation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across diverse datasets with exceptional robustness and generalization
capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于跨域蒸馏（CDD）框架的完全无监督异常检测方法，通过领域特定训练和跨域知识聚合来解决训练数据中包含异常样本的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 完全无监督异常检测（FUAD）是一个实用的扩展，旨在即使训练集中包含异常样本时也能无标签地检测异常。传统知识蒸馏方法在FUAD设置下存在风险，因为学生可能学习到教师对异常的表征。

Method: 提出跨域蒸馏框架：1）领域特定训练：将训练集划分为多个异常比例较低的域，为每个域训练特定学生；2）跨域知识聚合：通过领域特定学生生成的伪正常特征协同指导全局学生学习跨所有样本的广义正常表征。

Result: 在MVTec AD和VisA数据集的噪声版本上的实验结果表明，该方法相比基线取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的跨域蒸馏框架在完全无监督异常检测设置下有效，能够处理训练数据中的异常样本问题，提高异常检测性能。

Abstract: Fully Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (FUAD) is a practical extension of
Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD), aiming to detect anomalies without any
labels even when the training set may contain anomalous samples. To achieve
FUAD, we pioneer the introduction of Knowledge Distillation (KD) paradigm based
on teacher-student framework into the FUAD setting. However, due to the
presence of anomalies in the training data, traditional KD methods risk
enabling the student to learn the teacher's representation of anomalies under
FUAD setting, thereby resulting in poor anomaly detection performance. To
address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Domain Distillation (CDD)
framework based on the widely studied reverse distillation (RD) paradigm.
Specifically, we design a Domain-Specific Training, which divides the training
set into multiple domains with lower anomaly ratios and train a domain-specific
student for each. Cross-Domain Knowledge Aggregation is then performed, where
pseudo-normal features generated by domain-specific students collaboratively
guide a global student to learn generalized normal representations across all
samples. Experimental results on noisy versions of the MVTec AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance
improvements over the baseline, validating its effectiveness under FUAD
setting.

Conclusion: 首次使用2D X射线作为颅骨表示进行颅面重建，为法医鉴定提供了新的有效解决方案

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensics is one of the processes to identify
victims of crime and natural disasters. Identifying an individual from their
remains plays a crucial role when all other identification methods fail.
Traditional methods for this task, such as clay-based craniofacial
reconstruction, require expert domain knowledge and are a time-consuming
process. At the same time, other probabilistic generative models like the
statistical shape model or the Basel face model fail to capture the skull and
face cross-domain attributes. Looking at these limitations, we propose a
generic framework for craniofacial reconstruction from 2D X-ray images. Here,
we used various generative models (i.e., CycleGANs, cGANs, etc) and fine-tune
the generator and discriminator parts to generate more realistic images in two
distinct domains, which are the skull and face of an individual. This is the
first time where 2D X-rays are being used as a representation of the skull by
generative models for craniofacial reconstruction. We have evaluated the
quality of generated faces using FID, IS, and SSIM scores. Finally, we have
proposed a retrieval framework where the query is the generated face image and
the gallery is the database of real faces. By experimental results, we have
found that this can be an effective tool for forensic science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归文本到图像生成模型在处理多属性和模糊提示时能力有限，且大多数模型只在生成阶段结束时提供奖励信号，这种单一的最后阶段指导难以确定哪些阶段对最终结果有积极贡献，可能导致次优策略。

Method: 提出Visual-Chain of Guidance (Visual-CoG)范式，包含三个阶段：语义推理、过程精炼和结果评估，通过阶段感知奖励在整个图像生成流程中提供即时指导。还构建了视觉认知基准VisCog-Bench来评估语义推理效果。

Result: 在GenEval、T2I-CompBench和提出的VisCog-Bench基准测试中分别实现了15%、5%和19%的性能提升，证明了Visual-CoG的优越性能。

Conclusion: Visual-CoG范式通过引入阶段感知奖励机制和多阶段指导，有效提升了文本到图像生成模型处理复杂提示的能力，在多个评估基准上展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Despite the promising progress of recent autoregressive models in
text-to-image (T2I) generation, their ability to handle multi-attribute and
ambiguous prompts remains limited. To address these limitations, existing works
have applied chain-of-thought (CoT) to enable stage-aware visual synthesis and
employed reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, most models provide reward signals only at the end of the generation
stage. This monolithic final-only guidance makes it difficult to identify which
stages contribute positively to the final outcome and may lead to suboptimal
policies. To tackle this issue, we propose a Visual-Chain of Guidance
(Visual-CoG) paradigm consisting of three stages: semantic reasoning, process
refining, and outcome evaluation, with stage-aware rewards providing immediate
guidance throughout the image generation pipeline. We further construct a
visual cognition benchmark, VisCog-Bench, which comprises four subtasks to
evaluate the effectiveness of semantic reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on
GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and the proposed VisCog-Bench show improvements of 15%,
5%, and 19%, respectively, demonstrating the superior performance of the
proposed Visual-CoG. We will release all the resources soon.

Conclusion: ArgusCogito通过跨模态协同和全方位推理的认知启发方法，有效解决了伪装目标分割的挑战，展现了出色的分割性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) poses a significant challenge due to
the intrinsic high similarity between targets and backgrounds, demanding models
capable of profound holistic understanding beyond superficial cues. Prevailing
methods, often limited by shallow feature representation, inadequate reasoning
mechanisms, and weak cross-modal integration, struggle to achieve this depth of
cognition, resulting in prevalent issues like incomplete target separation and
imprecise segmentation. Inspired by the perceptual strategy of the Hundred-eyed
Giant-emphasizing holistic observation, omnidirectional focus, and intensive
scrutiny-we introduce ArgusCogito, a novel zero-shot, chain-of-thought
framework underpinned by cross-modal synergy and omnidirectional reasoning
within Vision-Language Models (VLMs). ArgusCogito orchestrates three
cognitively-inspired stages: (1) Conjecture: Constructs a strong cognitive
prior through global reasoning with cross-modal fusion (RGB, depth, semantic
maps), enabling holistic scene understanding and enhanced target-background
disambiguation. (2) Focus: Performs omnidirectional, attention-driven scanning
and focused reasoning, guided by semantic priors from Conjecture, enabling
precise target localization and region-of-interest refinement. (3) Sculpting:
Progressively sculpts high-fidelity segmentation masks by integrating
cross-modal information and iteratively generating dense positive/negative
point prompts within focused regions, emulating Argus' intensive scrutiny.
Extensive evaluations on four challenging COS benchmarks and three Medical
Image Segmentation (MIS) benchmarks demonstrate that ArgusCogito achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating the framework's exceptional
efficacy, superior generalization capability, and robustness.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) images is pivotal for
comprehensive Earth observation, but the demand for interpreting new object
categories, coupled with the high expense of manual annotation, poses
significant challenges. Although open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS)
offers a promising solution, existing frameworks designed for natural images
are insufficient for the unique complexities of RS data. They struggle with
vast scale variations and fine-grained details, and their adaptation often
relies on extensive, costly annotations. To address this critical gap, this
paper introduces SegEarth-OV, the first framework for annotation-free
open-vocabulary segmentation of RS images. Specifically, we propose SimFeatUp,
a universal upsampler that robustly restores high-resolution spatial details
from coarse features, correcting distorted target shapes without any
task-specific post-training. We also present a simple yet effective Global Bias
Alleviation operation to subtract the inherent global context from patch
features, significantly enhancing local semantic fidelity. These components
empower SegEarth-OV to effectively harness the rich semantics of pre-trained
VLMs, making OVSS possible in optical RS contexts. Furthermore, to extend the
framework's universality to other challenging RS modalities like SAR images,
where large-scale VLMs are unavailable and expensive to create, we introduce
AlignEarth, which is a distillation-based strategy and can efficiently transfer
semantic knowledge from an optical VLM encoder to an SAR encoder, bypassing the
need to build SAR foundation models from scratch and enabling universal OVSS
across diverse sensor types. Extensive experiments on both optical and SAR
datasets validate that SegEarth-OV can achieve dramatic improvements over the
SOTA methods, establishing a robust foundation for annotation-free and
open-world Earth observation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EventTracer是一个基于路径追踪的渲染流水线，能够高效地从复杂3D场景模拟高保真事件序列，通过低SPP路径追踪加速渲染，并使用轻量级事件脉冲网络去噪生成逼真事件数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件流模拟方法通常使用无噪声RGB帧，渲染成本高且时间分辨率低（100-300 FPS），远低于真实事件数据。需要一种高效、物理感知的方法来生成大规模、高时间频率的事件数据。

Method: 采用低样本每像素（SPP）路径追踪加速渲染，训练轻量级事件脉冲网络进行去噪。网络使用双极泄漏积分发放（BiLIF）脉冲单元和双向地球移动距离（EMD）损失函数来捕捉事件流的物理特性。

Result: EventTracer流水线以约4分钟/秒720p视频的速度运行，继承了路径追踪的精确时空建模优势。在两个下游任务中显示比其他事件模拟器能捕获更好的场景细节，与真实事件数据相似度更高。

Conclusion: EventTracer是一个有前景的工具，能够以低成本创建大规模事件-RGB数据集，缩小事件视觉的模拟到真实差距，并促进机器人、自动驾驶和VR/AR等应用场景的发展。

Abstract: Simulating event streams from 3D scenes has become a common practice in
event-based vision research, as it meets the demand for large-scale, high
temporal frequency data without setting up expensive hardware devices or
undertaking extensive data collections. Yet existing methods in this direction
typically work with noiseless RGB frames that are costly to render, and
therefore they can only achieve a temporal resolution equivalent to 100-300
FPS, far lower than that of real-world event data. In this work, we propose
EventTracer, a path tracing-based rendering pipeline that simulates
high-fidelity event sequences from complex 3D scenes in an efficient and
physics-aware manner. Specifically, we speed up the rendering process via low
sample-per-pixel (SPP) path tracing, and train a lightweight event spiking
network to denoise the resulting RGB videos into realistic event sequences. To
capture the physical properties of event streams, the network is equipped with
a bipolar leaky integrate-and-fired (BiLIF) spiking unit and trained with a
bidirectional earth mover distance (EMD) loss. Our EventTracer pipeline runs at
a speed of about 4 minutes per second of 720p video, and it inherits the merit
of accurate spatiotemporal modeling from its path tracing backbone. We show in
two downstream tasks that EventTracer captures better scene details and
demonstrates a greater similarity to real-world event data than other event
simulators, which establishes it as a promising tool for creating large-scale
event-RGB datasets at a low cost, narrowing the sim-to-real gap in event-based
vision, and boosting various application scenarios such as robotics, autonomous
driving, and VRAR.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了开放集少样本HSI分类中未知类别的发现和识别问题，为实际应用提供了更完整的解决方案

Abstract: Open-set few-shot hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims to classify
image pixels by using few labeled pixels per class, where the pixels to be
classified may be not all from the classes that have been seen. To address the
open-set HSI classification challenge, current methods focus mainly on
distinguishing the unknown class samples from the known class samples and
rejecting them to increase the accuracy of identifying known class samples.
They fails to further identify or discovery the unknow classes among the
samples. This paper proposes a prototype learning and clustering method for
discoverying unknown classes in HSIs under the few-shot environment. Using few
labeled samples, it strives to develop the ability of infering the prototypes
of unknown classes while distinguishing unknown classes from known classes.
Once the unknown class samples are rejected by the learned known class
classifier, the proposed method can further cluster the unknown class samples
into different classes according to their distance to the inferred unknown
class prototypes. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, extensive
experiments on four benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that our proposed method
exhibits competitive performance in open-set few-shot HSI classification tasks.

Abstract: This paper aims to unify Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), also known as

reparameterization techniques: Iterative Proportional Mean-Matching (IPMM),
Iterative Proportional Terminus-Matching (IPTM), and Iterative Proportional
Flow-Matching (IPFM). These techniques significantly accelerate and stabilize
the training of SB-based models. Furthermore, the paper introduces novel
initialization strategies that use pre-trained SGMs to effectively train
SB-based models. By using SGMs as initialization, we leverage the advantages of
both SB-based models and SGMs, ensuring efficient training of SB-based models
and further improving the performance of SGMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the significant effectiveness and improvements of the proposed
methods. We believe this work contributes to and paves the way for future
research on generative models.

Abstract: Visually-guided image editing, where edits are conditioned on both visual
cues and textual prompts, has emerged as a powerful paradigm for fine-grained,
controllable content generation. Although recent generative models have shown
remarkable capabilities, existing evaluations remain simple and insufficiently
representative of real-world editing challenges. We present SpotEdit, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess visually-guided image
editing methods across diverse diffusion, autoregressive, and hybrid generative
models, uncovering substantial performance disparities. To address a critical
yet underexplored challenge, our benchmark includes a dedicated component on
hallucination, highlighting how leading models, such as GPT-4o, often
hallucinate the existence of a visual cue and erroneously perform the editing
task. Our code and benchmark are publicly released at

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are vital for training segmentation models, but
pixel-level labeling is time-consuming, error-prone, and often requires scarce
expert annotators, especially in medical imaging. In contrast, coarse
annotations are quicker, cheaper, and easier to produce, even by non-experts.
In this paper, we propose to use coarse drawings from both positive (target)
and negative (background) classes in the image, even with noisy pixels, to
train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. We
present a method for learning the true segmentation label distributions from
purely noisy coarse annotations using two coupled CNNs. The separation of the
two CNNs is achieved by high fidelity with the characters of the noisy training
annotations. We propose to add a complementary label learning that encourages
estimating negative label distribution. To illustrate the properties of our
method, we first use a toy segmentation dataset based on MNIST. We then present
the quantitative results of experiments using publicly available datasets:
Cityscapes dataset for multi-class segmentation, and retinal images for medical
applications. In all experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in the cases where the ratio of coarse annotations is
small compared to the given dense annotations.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量后处理或产生低质量重建，需要利用手-物体交互的几何约束来直接生成高质量3D物体几何

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型，以修复后的物体外观为条件，通过速度场监督和多模态几何线索（法线深度对齐、轮廓一致性、关键点重投影）进行推理时指导，同时优化手和物体的变换，并加入SDF监督和接触约束

Result: 在遮挡情况下产生准确、鲁棒和一致的重建结果，在野外场景中泛化良好

Conclusion: 该方法通过扩散过程中的几何指导和优化循环设计，能够直接生成高质量的手持物体3D重建，无需大量后处理

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for reconstructing 3D geometry
of hand-held objects from monocular RGB images by leveraging hand-object
interaction as geometric guidance. Our method conditions a latent diffusion
model on an inpainted object appearance and uses inference-time guidance to
optimize the object reconstruction, while simultaneously ensuring plausible
hand-object interactions. Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive
post-processing or produce low-quality reconstructions, our approach directly
generates high-quality object geometry during the diffusion process by
introducing guidance with an optimization-in-the-loop design. Specifically, we
guide the diffusion model by applying supervision to the velocity field while
simultaneously optimizing the transformations of both the hand and the object
being reconstructed. This optimization is driven by multi-modal geometric cues,
including normal and depth alignment, silhouette consistency, and 2D keypoint
reprojection. We further incorporate signed distance field supervision and
enforce contact and non-intersection constraints to ensure physical
plausibility of hand-object interaction. Our method yields accurate, robust and
coherent reconstructions under occlusion while generalizing well to in-the-wild
scenarios.

TL;DR: GM-Skip是一个用于Transformer块跳过的灵活框架，通过度量引导的贪婪选择和反向删除机制，在保持输出质量的同时加速视觉语言模型的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的视觉语言模型虽然性能出色，但计算成本高，难以部署在自动驾驶等延迟敏感的应用中。需要一种方法在保持性能的同时加速推理。

Method: 采用贪婪的度量引导块选择策略，使用准确率等度量反馈识别冗余层；结合反向顺序删除机制保留早期基础块；通过分数-稀疏性平衡目标实现可调节的性能与稀疏性权衡。

Result: 在COCO数据集上，人物类别单目标分类准确率从19.1%提升至87.3%，同时跳过超过40%的Transformer块；在自动驾驶系统中实现45.4%的延迟降低。

Conclusion: GM-Skip框架能有效加速视觉语言模型推理，在多个任务和数据集上保持性能，具有实际部署价值，特别适用于自动驾驶等实时应用场景。

Abstract: Transformer-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive
performance on tasks such as image captioning, object recognition, and visual
reasoning, but their high computational cost hinders deployment in
latency-sensitive applications like autonomous driving. We introduce GM-Skip, a
flexible and metric-adaptive framework for Transformer block skipping that
accelerates VLM inference while preserving output quality. GM-Skip features a
greedy, metric-guided block selection strategy that uses metric feedback (e.g.,
accuracy, CIDEr) to identify redundant layers, along with a reverse-order
deletion mechanism that preserves early foundational blocks to avoid
performance collapse. To support diverse deployment needs, it incorporates a
tunable trade-off between sparsity and performance via a score-sparsity balance
objective. Experiments across multiple tasks and datasets, including COCO and
CODA, show that GM-Skip consistently improves inference speed while maintaining
task performance. On the COCO dataset, GM-Skip improves single-object
classification accuracy on the Person category from 19.1 percent to 87.3
percent while skipping more than 40 percent of Transformer blocks. In
real-world deployment, it achieves up to 45.4 percent latency reduction on
single-object detection when integrated into an autonomous vehicle running
Autoware.Universe, validating the effectiveness of its skip configurations and
confirming its practical value in accelerating real-world inference.

TL;DR: SKD-CAG方法通过自知识蒸馏和交叉注意力引导，选择性消除文本到图像扩散模型中文本后门攻击的关联，在保持图像质量的同时有效防御后门攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型容易受到后门攻击，攻击者可以通过注入不可见的文本触发器来操纵模型输出，而现有生成模型缺乏有效的防御技术。

Method: 采用自知识蒸馏和交叉注意力引导(SKD-CAG)，利用后门模型在没有触发器时仍能生成干净输出的特性，在注意力层面消除后门影响。

Result: 方法在像素后门攻击上达到100%移除准确率，在基于风格的攻击上达到93%准确率，且不牺牲模型鲁棒性或图像保真度。

Conclusion: 目标性遗忘是保护生成模型安全的有前景的防御策略，SKD-CAG方法为文本到图像扩散模型提供了有效的后门防御解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI, but their
vulnerability to backdoor attacks poses significant security risks. Adversaries
can inject imperceptible textual triggers into training data, causing models to
generate manipulated outputs. Although text-based backdoor defenses in
classification models are well-explored, generative models lack effective
mitigation techniques against. We address this by selectively erasing the
model's learned associations between adversarial text triggers and poisoned
outputs, while preserving overall generation quality. Our approach,
Self-Knowledge Distillation with Cross-Attention Guidance (SKD-CAG), uses
knowledge distillation to guide the model in correcting responses to poisoned
prompts while maintaining image quality by exploiting the fact that the
backdoored model still produces clean outputs in the absence of triggers. Using
the cross-attention mechanism, SKD-CAG neutralizes backdoor influences at the
attention level, ensuring the targeted removal of adversarial effects.
Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches,
achieving removal accuracy 100\% for pixel backdoors and 93\% for style-based
attacks, without sacrificing robustness or image fidelity. Our findings
highlight targeted unlearning as a promising defense to secure generative
models. Code and model weights can be found at

TL;DR: LanSE是一个新颖的架构，通过识别可解释的视觉模式并用自然语言描述，为AI生成内容提供细粒度的可解释评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成内容（如合成图像）质量评估指标过于粗粒度，无法识别具体优缺点，限制了模型选择和科学理解。

Method: 提出Language-Grounded Sparse Encoders (LanSE)架构，通过大规模人类评估（11,000+标注）和多模态模型分析，识别可解释视觉模式。

Result: LanSE在自然图像中检测可解释视觉模式的准确率超过93%，能够量化生成质量的四个关键维度：提示匹配、视觉真实感、物理合理性和内容多样性。

Conclusion: LanSE通过将可解释性与实际评估需求相结合，为生成AI模型用户提供了强大的工具，有助于模型选择、质量控制和改进，增强公众对AI生成内容的信心和安全。

Abstract: While the quality of AI-generated contents, such as synthetic images, has
become remarkably high, current evaluation metrics provide only coarse-grained
assessments, failing to identify specific strengths and weaknesses that
researchers and practitioners need for model selection and development, further
limiting the scientific understanding and commercial deployment of these
generative models. To address this, we introduce Language-Grounded Sparse
Encoders (LanSE), a novel architecture that creates interpretable evaluation
metrics by identifying interpretable visual patterns and automatically
describing them in natural language. Through large-scale human evaluation (more
than 11,000 annotations) and large multimodal model (LMM) based analysis, LanSE
demonstrates reliable capabilities to detect interpretable visual patterns in
synthetic images with more than 93\% accuracy in natural images. LanSE further
provides a fine-grained evaluation framework that quantifies four key
dimensions of generation quality, prompt match, visual realism, physical
plausibility, and content diversity. LanSE reveals nuanced model differences
invisible to existing metrics, for instance, FLUX's superior physical
plausibility and SDXL-medium's strong content diversity, while aligning with
human judgments. By bridging interpretability with practical evaluation needs,
LanSE offers all users of generative AI models a powerful tool for model
selection, quality control of synthetic content, and model improvement. These
capabilities directly address the need for public confidence and safety in
AI-generated content, both critical for the future of generative AI
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目相机下3D人体姿态估计中需要标定信息的问题，开发一个既能处理完整先验信息又能适应缺失情况的通用模型

Method: 使用Transformer架构，输入包括2D关节点、骨骼段长度和相机内参等几何先验，通过掩码机制处理缺失先验，在AMASS数据集上训练并生成合成2D数据

Result: 平均3D关节中心位置估计精度达到36mm，比现有技术提升0.5厘米，在GPU上运行时间380μs，CPU上1800μs，计算成本大幅降低

Conclusion: 该模型在标定和非标定场景下均表现出色，通用模型优于专用专家模型，适合在嵌入式平台和低功耗设备上部署

Abstract: This paper proposes a new lightweight Transformer-based lifter that maps
short sequences of human 2D joint positions to 3D poses using a single camera.
The proposed model takes as input geometric priors including segment lengths
and camera intrinsics and is designed to operate in both calibrated and
uncalibrated settings. To this end, a masking mechanism enables the model to
ignore missing priors during training and inference. This yields a single
versatile network that can adapt to different deployment scenarios, from fully
calibrated lab environments to in-the-wild monocular videos without
calibration. The model was trained using 3D keypoints from AMASS dataset with
corresponding 2D synthetic data generated by sampling random camera poses and
intrinsics. It was then compared to an expert model trained, only on complete
priors, and the validation was done by conducting an ablation study. Results
show that both, camera and segment length priors, improve performance and that
the versatile model outperforms the expert, even when all priors are available,
and maintains high accuracy when priors are missing. Overall the average 3D
joint center positions estimation accuracy was as low as 36mm improving state
of the art by half a centimeter and at a much lower computational cost. Indeed,
the proposed model runs in 380$\mu$s on GPU and 1800$\mu$s on CPU, making it
suitable for deployment on embedded platforms and low-power devices.

TL;DR: GSVisLoc是一种基于3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)场景表示的视觉定位方法，通过粗匹配、精匹配和姿态优化三个步骤，实现无需修改、重训练或额外参考图像的相机位姿估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉定位方法通常需要复杂的场景表示或大量参考图像。3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)作为一种新兴的显式3D场景表示方法，具有高效渲染的优势，但尚未被充分用于视觉定位任务。

Method: 方法分为三步：1) 通过下采样和编码3D高斯生成场景特征；2) 编码图像块获取图像特征；3) 进行粗匹配、精匹配，最后通过姿态优化获得精确的相机位姿估计。

Result: 在室内外场景的标准基准测试中表现出竞争性的定位性能，优于现有的3DGS基线方法，且能够有效泛化到新场景而无需额外训练。

Conclusion: GSVisLoc成功地将3DGS场景表示应用于视觉定位任务，证明了其在不修改场景表示、无需重训练或额外参考图像的情况下实现准确相机定位的能力。

Abstract: We introduce GSVisLoc, a visual localization method designed for 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) scene representations. Given a 3DGS model of a scene and a
query image, our goal is to estimate the camera's position and orientation. We
accomplish this by robustly matching scene features to image features. Scene
features are produced by downsampling and encoding the 3D Gaussians while image
features are obtained by encoding image patches. Our algorithm proceeds in
three steps, starting with coarse matching, then fine matching, and finally by
applying pose refinement for an accurate final estimate. Importantly, our
method leverages the explicit 3DGS scene representation for visual localization
without requiring modifications, retraining, or additional reference images. We
evaluate GSVisLoc on both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating competitive
localization performance on standard benchmarks while outperforming existing
3DGS-based baselines. Moreover, our approach generalizes effectively to novel
scenes without additional training.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了MMTok方法，通过多模态覆盖准则来选择信息量高的视觉token，提高视觉-语言模型的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视觉token剪枝算法主要使用单模态信息，忽视了视觉-语言任务的多模态特性，导致token选择效果不佳。

Method: 将子集选择问题形式化为最大覆盖问题，优化视觉token子集来同时覆盖文本token和原始视觉token集，并使用VLM组件改善文本token质量来指导视觉token剪枝。

Result: 在POPE数据集上实现1.87倍速度提升，保持98.7%原始性能（LLaVA-NeXT-13B）；仅用4个视觉token仍保持87.7%性能（LLaVA-1.5-7B）。

Conclusion: 多模态信息在token选择中具有补充性，覆盖准则是一种有效的通用token选择方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in
understanding visual content with language instruction by converting visual
input to vision tokens. However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the
degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs. While many algorithms have been
proposed to reduce the number of vision tokens, most of them apply only
unimodal information (i.e., vision/text) for pruning and ignore the inherent
multimodal property of vision-language tasks. Moreover, it lacks a generic
criterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this
limitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to
select informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first
formulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem.
Afterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and
the original set of vision tokens, simultaneously. Finally, a VLM agent can be
adopted to further improve the quality of text tokens for guiding vision
pruning. The proposed method MMTok is extensively evaluated on benchmark
datasets with different VLMs. The comparison illustrates that vision and text
information are complementary, and combining multimodal information can surpass
the unimodal baseline with a clear margin. Moreover, under the maximum coverage
criterion on the POPE dataset, our method achieves a 1.87x speedup while
maintaining 98.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-NeXT-13B. Furthermore,
with only four vision tokens, it still preserves 87.7% of the original
performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B. These results highlight the effectiveness of
coverage in token selection.

Conclusion: InternVL 3.5通过创新的训练策略和效率优化技术，成功提升了多模态模型的性能和效率，支持GUI交互和具身代理等新能力，为开源社区提供了强大的多模态解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce InternVL 3.5, a new family of open-source multimodal models that
significantly advances versatility, reasoning capability, and inference
efficiency along the InternVL series. A key innovation is the Cascade
Reinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through
a two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for
refined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial
improvements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To
optimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that
dynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising
performance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD)
strategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs,
effectively balancing computational load. These contributions collectively
enable InternVL3.5 to achieve up to a +16.0\% gain in overall reasoning
performance and a 4.05$\times$ inference speedup compared to its predecessor,
i.e., InternVL3. In addition, InternVL3.5 supports novel capabilities such as
GUI interaction and embodied agency. Notably, our largest model, i.e.,
InternVL3.5-241B-A28B, attains state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs
across general multimodal, reasoning, text, and agentic tasks -- narrowing the
performance gap with leading commercial models like GPT-5. All models and code

Conclusion: ObjFiller-3D通过创新的视频模型适配方法有效解决了3D修复中的一致性问题，为高质量3D对象完成和编辑提供了有效的解决方案，具有实际部署的潜力。

Abstract: 3D inpainting often relies on multi-view 2D image inpainting, where the
inherent inconsistencies across different inpainted views can result in blurred
textures, spatial discontinuities, and distracting visual artifacts. These
inconsistencies pose significant challenges when striving for accurate and
realistic 3D object completion, particularly in applications that demand high
fidelity and structural coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ObjFiller-3D, a novel method designed for the completion and editing of
high-quality and consistent 3D objects. Instead of employing a conventional 2D
image inpainting model, our approach leverages a curated selection of
state-of-the-art video editing model to fill in the masked regions of 3D
objects. We analyze the representation gap between 3D and videos, and propose
an adaptation of a video inpainting model for 3D scene inpainting. In addition,
we introduce a reference-based 3D inpainting method to further enhance the
quality of reconstruction. Experiments across diverse datasets show that
compared to previous methods, ObjFiller-3D produces more faithful and
fine-grained reconstructions (PSNR of 26.6 vs. NeRFiller (15.9) and LPIPS of
0.19 vs. Instant3dit (0.25)). Moreover, it demonstrates strong potential for
practical deployment in real-world 3D editing applications. Project page:

Method: 使用协作agent团队：分析agent通过主题建模识别错误模式，生成agent基于反馈修订提示，在遗传算法框架下通过交叉和变异操作进化候选提示。

Result: 在公共基准数据集上的大量实验表明，GreenTEA在逻辑推理、定量推理、常识和伦理决策等任务上优于人工设计的提示和现有最先进的自动提示优化方法。

Conclusion: GreenTEA通过平衡探索和利用的agentic工作流，有效解决了自动提示优化的挑战，在多个领域展现出优越性能。

Abstract: High-quality prompts are crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve
exceptional performance. However, manually crafting effective prompts is
labor-intensive and demands significant domain expertise, limiting its
scalability. Existing automatic prompt optimization methods either extensively
explore new prompt candidates, incurring high computational costs due to
inefficient searches within a large solution space, or overly exploit feedback
on existing prompts, risking suboptimal optimization because of the complex
prompt landscape. To address these challenges, we introduce GreenTEA, an
agentic LLM workflow for automatic prompt optimization that balances candidate
exploration and knowledge exploitation. It leverages a collaborative team of
agents to iteratively refine prompts based on feedback from error samples. An
analyzing agent identifies common error patterns resulting from the current
prompt via topic modeling, and a generation agent revises the prompt to
directly address these key deficiencies. This refinement process is guided by a
genetic algorithm framework, which simulates natural selection by evolving
candidate prompts through operations such as crossover and mutation to
progressively optimize model performance. Extensive numerical experiments
conducted on public benchmark datasets suggest the superior performance of
GreenTEA against human-engineered prompts and existing state-of-the-arts for
automatic prompt optimization, covering logical and quantitative reasoning,
commonsense, and ethical decision-making.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a fundamental challenge in deciding when to
rely on rapid, intuitive responses versus engaging in slower, more deliberate
reasoning. Inspired by Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory and his insights
on human cognitive biases, we propose a novel Cognitive Decision Routing (CDR)
framework that dynamically determines the appropriate reasoning strategy based
on query characteristics. Our approach addresses the current limitations where
models either apply uniform reasoning depth or rely on computationally
expensive methods for all queries. We introduce a meta-cognitive layer that
analyzes query complexity through multiple dimensions: correlation strength
between given information and required conclusions, domain boundary crossings,
stakeholder multiplicity, and uncertainty levels. Through extensive experiments
on diverse reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that CDR achieves superior
performance while reducing computational costs by 34\% compared to uniform deep
reasoning approaches. Our framework shows particular strength in professional
judgment tasks, achieving 23\% improvement in consistency and 18\% better
accuracy on expert-level evaluations. This work bridges cognitive science
principles with practical AI system design, offering a principled approach to
adaptive reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a new frontier for scaling the
performance of Large Language Models. In test-time scaling, by using more
computational resources during inference, LLMs can improve their reasoning
process and task performance. Several approaches have emerged for TTS such as
distilling reasoning traces from another model or exploring the vast decoding
search space by employing a verifier. The verifiers serve as reward models that
help score the candidate outputs from the decoding process to diligently
explore the vast solution space and select the best outcome. This paradigm
commonly termed has emerged as a superior approach owing to parameter free
scaling at inference time and high performance gains. The verifiers could be
prompt-based, fine-tuned as a discriminative or generative model to verify
process paths, outcomes or both. Despite their widespread adoption, there is no
detailed collection, clear categorization and discussion of diverse
verification approaches and their training mechanisms. In this survey, we cover
the diverse approaches in the literature and present a unified view of verifier
training, types and their utility in test-time scaling. Our repository can be

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) has been
driven by introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, where models generate
intermediate reasoning traces before producing an answer. These traces, as in
DeepSeek R1, are not only used to guide inference but also serve as supervision
signals for distillation into smaller models. A common but often implicit
assumption is that CoT traces should be semantically meaningful and
interpretable to the end user. While recent research questions the need for
semantic nature of these traces, in this paper, we ask: ``\textit{Must CoT
reasoning traces be interpretable to enhance LLM task performance?}" We
investigate this question in the Open Book Question-Answering domain by
supervised fine-tuning LLaMA and Qwen models on four types of reasoning traces:
(1) DeepSeek R1 traces, (2) LLM-generated summaries of R1 traces, (3)
LLM-generated post-hoc explanations of R1 traces, and (4) algorithmically
generated verifiably correct traces. To quantify the trade-off between
interpretability and performance, we further conduct a human-subject study with
100 participants rating the interpretability of each trace type. Our results
reveal a striking mismatch: while fine-tuning on R1 traces yields the strongest
performance, participants judged these traces to be the least interpretable.
These findings suggest that it is useful to decouple intermediate tokens from
end user interpretability.

### [200] [QueryBandits for Hallucination Mitigation: Exploiting Semantic Features for No-Regret Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16697)
*Nicole Cho,William Watson,Alec Koppel,Sumitra Ganesh,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QueryBandits是一个基于多臂老虎机框架的查询重写系统，通过分析17个语言特征来主动减少LLM幻觉，在13个QA基准测试中显著优于无重写基线和静态提示方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数缓解LLM幻觉的工作侧重于事后过滤，而不是在触发幻觉之前对查询进行干预。本文旨在通过主动设计查询重写策略来减少幻觉生成。

Method: 提出QueryBandits框架，使用多臂老虎机算法设计重写策略，最大化基于17个语言特征的奖励模型，通过Thompson Sampling等算法动态选择最优重写方式。

Result: 在13个多样化QA基准测试和1,050个词汇扰动查询上，最佳QueryBandits方法相比无重写基线获得87.5%的胜率，比零样本静态提示方法分别高出42.6%和60.3%。

Conclusion: QueryBandits通过前向传递机制有效减少LLM幻觉，无需重新训练或基于梯度的适应，证明了动态查询重写比静态方法更有效，且没有单一重写策略适用于所有查询。

Abstract: Advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) have caused
higher hallucination prevalence; yet most mitigation work focuses on
after-the-fact filtering rather than shaping the queries that trigger them. We
introduce QueryBandits, a bandit framework that designs rewrite strategies to
maximize a reward model, that encapsulates hallucination propensity based upon
the sensitivities of 17 linguistic features of the input query-and therefore,
proactively steer LLMs away from generating hallucinations. Across 13 diverse
QA benchmarks and 1,050 lexically perturbed queries per dataset, our top
contextual QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a
no-rewrite baseline and also outperforms zero-shot static prompting
("paraphrase" or "expand") by 42.6% and 60.3% respectively. Therefore, we
empirically substantiate the effectiveness of QueryBandits in mitigating
hallucination via the intervention that takes the form of a query rewrite.
Interestingly, certain static prompting strategies, which constitute a
considerable number of current query rewriting literature, have a higher
cumulative regret than the no-rewrite baseline, signifying that static rewrites
can worsen hallucination. Moreover, we discover that the converged per-arm
regression feature weight vectors substantiate that there is no single rewrite
strategy optimal for all queries. In this context, guided rewriting via
exploiting semantic features with QueryBandits can induce significant shifts in
output behavior through forward-pass mechanisms, bypassing the need for
retraining or gradient-based adaptation.

*Rui A. Pimenta,Tim Schlippe,Kristina Schaaff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用迷宫测试评估大语言模型的类意识行为，发现推理能力强的模型表现更好，但缺乏持续连贯的自我意识


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型是否表现出类似意识的行为特征，通过迷宫测试同时探测空间感知、视角转换、目标导向行为和时序推理等关键意识相关特征

Method: 将意识理论综合为13个基本特征，在零样本、单样本和少样本学习场景下评估12个主流LLM，使用迷宫导航任务从第一人称视角测试

Result: 推理能力强的LLM表现优于标准版本，Gemini 2.0 Pro达到52.9%完整路径准确率，DeepSeek-R1达到80.5%部分路径准确率，但完整与部分路径准确率之间的差距表明模型难以维持连贯的自我模型

Conclusion: LLM通过推理机制在意识相关行为方面取得进展，但缺乏意识所特有的整合性、持续性的自我意识

Abstract: We investigate consciousness-like behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs)
using the Maze Test, challenging models to navigate mazes from a first-person
perspective. This test simultaneously probes spatial awareness,
perspective-taking, goal-directed behavior, and temporal sequencing-key
consciousness-associated characteristics. After synthesizing consciousness
theories into 13 essential characteristics, we evaluated 12 leading LLMs across
zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning scenarios. Results showed
reasoning-capable LLMs consistently outperforming standard versions, with
Gemini 2.0 Pro achieving 52.9% Complete Path Accuracy and DeepSeek-R1 reaching
80.5% Partial Path Accuracy. The gap between these metrics indicates LLMs
struggle to maintain coherent self-models throughout solutions -- a fundamental
consciousness aspect. While LLMs show progress in consciousness-related
behaviors through reasoning mechanisms, they lack the integrated, persistent
self-awareness characteristic of consciousness.

TL;DR: 通过自我知识蓄约实现密集与稀疏表征的双向学习，在保持稀疏模型优势的同时达到类似或更优于密集模型的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态稀疏检索方法依赖计算程度高的对比预训练或从冻结密集模型蓄约，限制了两种表征的相互增强潜力

Method: 提出基于自我知识蓄约的双向学习框架，使用密集和稀疏相似度的加权和作为共享的教师信号，只微调密集编码器的最后一层和稀疏投影头

Result: 在MSCOCO和Flickr30k数据集上，稀疏检索器不仅超过现有稀疏基线，而且达到了类似或更优于密集模型的性能

Conclusion: 该框架能够在保持稀疏模型效率和可解释性优势的同时，实现与密集模型相当的性能，为多模态检索提供了一种高效的解决方案

Abstract: Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models have achieved impressive performance
on multimodal tasks, including text-image retrieval, based on dense
representations. Meanwhile, Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) has gained traction
in text-only settings due to its interpretability and efficiency with fast
term-based lookup via inverted indexes. Inspired by these advantages, recent
work has extended LSR to the multimodal domain. However, these methods often
rely on computationally expensive contrastive pre-training, or distillation
from a frozen dense model, which limits the potential for mutual enhancement.
To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective framework that
enables bi-directional learning between dense and sparse representations
through Self-Knowledge Distillation. This bi-directional learning is achieved
using an integrated similarity score-a weighted sum of dense and sparse
similarities-which serves as a shared teacher signal for both representations.
To ensure efficiency, we fine-tune the final layer of the dense encoder and the
sparse projection head, enabling easy adaptation of any existing VLP model.
Experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k demonstrate that our sparse retriever not
only outperforms existing sparse baselines, but also achieves performance
comparable to-or even surpassing-its dense counterparts, while retaining the
benefits of sparse models.

TL;DR: 提出了错误反思提示（ERP）方法，在思维链（CoT）基础上增加错误识别和纠正机制，让语言模型能够自我反思和修正推理错误


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的思维链方法缺乏反思和纠错能力，容易导致错误积累。受人类反思能力的启发，需要开发能够识别和纠正推理错误的方法

Method: 构建包含错误答案、错误识别和正确答案的三步流程。通过自动化ERP生成，让模型能够自我识别错误类型和错误步骤，并整合到推理链中

Result: ERP作为传统CoT的有效补充，增强了模型的推理鲁棒性和能力，同时提高了模型错误产生过程的可解释性

Conclusion: 错误反思提示方法显著提升了语言模型的推理可靠性和可扩展性，为构建更稳健的推理系统提供了有效途径

Abstract: Prompting methods for language models, such as Chain-of-thought (CoT),
present intuitive step-by-step processes for problem solving. These
methodologies aim to equip models with a better understanding of the correct
procedures for addressing a given task. Despite these advancements, CoT lacks
the ability of reflection and error correction, potentially causing a model to
perpetuate mistakes and errors. Therefore, inspired by the human ability for
said tasks, we propose Error Reflection Prompting (ERP) to further enhance
reasoning in language models. Building upon CoT, ERP is a method comprised of
an incorrect answer, error recognition, and a correct answer. This process
enables the model to recognize types of errors and the steps that lead to
incorrect answers, allowing the model to better discern which steps to avoid
and which to take. The model is able to generate the error outlines itself with
automated ERP generation, allowing for error recognition and correction to be
integrated into the reasoning chain and produce scalability and reliability in
the process. The results demonstrate that ERP serves as a versatile supplement
to conventional CoT, ultimately contributing to more robust and capable
reasoning abilities along with increased interpretability in how models
ultimately reach their errors.

TL;DR: GAICo是一个开源的Python库，为生成式AI输出比较提供统一、可扩展的框架，支持多种模态和结构化数据的标准化评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在关键领域的快速应用需要稳健且可复现的评估方法，但现有评估脚本往往是非标准化的，缺乏对结构化输出和多模态比较的支持，阻碍了AI系统的可比性和开发速度。

Method: 开发GAICo库，提供高层API进行端到端分析（从多模型比较到可视化报告），同时支持直接访问指标进行细粒度控制，支持非结构化文本、结构化数据格式和多媒体的参考基准指标。

Result: 通过多模态AI旅行助手管道的案例研究展示了GAICo的实用性，该工具自2025年6月发布以来已被下载超过13,000次，显示出社区的高度兴趣。

Conclusion: GAICo使AI研究者和开发者能够高效评估系统性能，实现可复现的评估，提高开发速度，最终构建更可信的AI系统，支持更快更安全的AI部署。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Generative AI (GenAI) into diverse, high-stakes
domains necessitates robust and reproducible evaluation methods. However,
practitioners often resort to ad-hoc, non-standardized scripts, as common
metrics are often unsuitable for specialized, structured outputs (e.g.,
automated plans, time-series) or holistic comparison across modalities (e.g.,
text, audio, and image). This fragmentation hinders comparability and slows AI
system development. To address this challenge, we present GAICo (Generative AI
Comparator): a deployed, open-source Python library that streamlines and
standardizes GenAI output comparison. GAICo provides a unified, extensible
framework supporting a comprehensive suite of reference-based metrics for
unstructured text, specialized structured data formats, and multimedia (images,
audio). Its architecture features a high-level API for rapid, end-to-end
analysis, from multi-model comparison to visualization and reporting, alongside
direct metric access for granular control. We demonstrate GAICo's utility
through a detailed case study evaluating and debugging complex, multi-modal AI
Travel Assistant pipelines. GAICo empowers AI researchers and developers to
efficiently assess system performance, make evaluation reproducible, improve
development velocity, and ultimately build more trustworthy AI systems,
aligning with the goal of moving faster and safer in AI deployment. Since its
release on PyPI in Jun 2025, the tool has been downloaded over 13K times,
across versions, by Aug 2025, demonstrating growing community interest.

Motivation: 通过受控公平比较，确定LLM重排序器与轻量级方法之间的性能差距，特别是在新查询上的表现，并阐明差异的根本原因

Method: 在TREC DL19、DL20、BEIR等基准测试以及专门设计的新查询数据集上，评估40种方法变体，分析训练数据重叠、模型架构和计算效率等因素的影响

Result: LLM重排序器在熟悉查询上表现优越，但在新查询上的泛化能力参差不齐，轻量级模型具有相当的效率优势

Conclusion: 查询的新颖性显著影响重排序效果，现有方法存在局限性，需要改进对新查询的泛化能力

Abstract: In this work, we present a systematic and comprehensive empirical evaluation
of state-of-the-art reranking methods, encompassing large language model
(LLM)-based, lightweight contextual, and zero-shot approaches, with respect to
their performance in information retrieval tasks. We evaluate in total 22
methods, including 40 variants (depending on used LLM) across several
established benchmarks, including TREC DL19, DL20, and BEIR, as well as a novel
dataset designed to test queries unseen by pretrained models. Our primary goal
is to determine, through controlled and fair comparisons, whether a performance
disparity exists between LLM-based rerankers and their lightweight
counterparts, particularly on novel queries, and to elucidate the underlying
causes of any observed differences. To disentangle confounding factors, we
analyze the effects of training data overlap, model architecture, and
computational efficiency on reranking performance. Our findings indicate that
while LLM-based rerankers demonstrate superior performance on familiar queries,
their generalization ability to novel queries varies, with lightweight models
offering comparable efficiency. We further identify that the novelty of queries
significantly impacts reranking effectiveness, highlighting limitations in
existing approaches.

*Arka Mukherjee,Shreya Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文首次系统性评估视觉-语言模型的文化能力，通过多模态故事生成任务发现VLMs具有显著的文化适应能力，但同时曝露了模型间能力差异、反文化对齐等关键问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉-语言模型在多元文化环境中广泛部署，确保其文化能力成为责任任性AI系统的关键需求。虽然现有研究评估了单模态模型的文化意识，但尚无研究系统性地在生成任务中考察文本和视觉输入中嵌入文化识别符号时VLMs的适应能力。

Method: 研究构建了一个新的多模态框架，通过干扰文化识别来评估5个当代VLMs在故事生成任务上的表现。这个框架能够在文本提示和视觉输入中嵌入文化符号，并通过跨模态评估来分析模型的文化理解能力。

Result: 分析显示VLMs具有显著的文化适应能力，能够产生丰富的文化特定词汇，包括姓名、家庭称呼和地理标记。但同时发现了严重限制：不同架构模型间文化能力差异巨大，某些模型出现反文化对齐现象，自动化指标存在架构偏见且与人类评估相矛盾。跨模态评估显示文化特异输出可通过视觉-语义相似性检测（28.7%国内回归率vs0.2%跨国回归率），但视觉文化理解仍有限。

Conclusion: 研究证实了多模态AI中文化能力的潜力与挑战并存。虽然VLMs在文化适应方面显示出了一定能力，但存在的限制和偏见问题强调了在广泛部署前必须加强文化能力评估和改进的重要性。研究公开了代码库和数据集。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve widespread deployment across diverse
cultural contexts, ensuring their cultural competence becomes critical for
responsible AI systems. While prior work has evaluated cultural awareness in
text-only models and VLM object recognition tasks, no research has
systematically assessed how VLMs adapt outputs when cultural identity cues are
embedded in both textual prompts and visual inputs during generative tasks. We
present the first comprehensive evaluation of VLM cultural competence through
multimodal story generation, developing a novel multimodal framework that
perturbs cultural identity and evaluates 5 contemporary VLMs on a downstream
task: story generation. Our analysis reveals significant cultural adaptation
capabilities, with rich culturally-specific vocabulary spanning names, familial
terms, and geographic markers. However, we uncover concerning limitations:
cultural competence varies dramatically across architectures, some models
exhibit inverse cultural alignment, and automated metrics show architectural
bias contradicting human assessments. Cross-modal evaluation shows that
culturally distinct outputs are indeed detectable through visual-semantic
similarity (28.7% within-nationality vs. 0.2% cross-nationality recall), yet
visual-cultural understanding remains limited. In essence, we establish the
promise and challenges of cultural competence in multimodal AI. We publicly
release our codebase and data: https://github.com/ArkaMukherjee0/mmCultural

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线心理健康社区中许多帖子缺乏关键支持属性，导致无人回复，需要一种方法识别这些缺口并提示用户补充信息。

Method: 构建REDDME数据集（4,760个帖子），提出CueTaxo层次分类法，开发MH-COPILOT系统（包括属性识别、强度分类、控制问题生成和验证器），使用强化学习进行奖励建模。

Result: 在4个语言模型上都显示出在属性引导和用户参与度方面的显著改善，人工评估证实了模型在实际环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效提高在线心理健康社区的支持质量，通过动态识别缺失信息并生成有针对性的提示，促进更好的社区互动。

Abstract: Online Mental Health Communities (OMHCs) provide crucial peer and expert
support, yet many posts remain unanswered due to missing support attributes
that signal the need for help. We present a novel framework that identifies
these gaps and prompts users to enrich their posts, thereby improving
engagement. To support this, we introduce REDDME, a new dataset of 4,760 posts
from mental health subreddits annotated for the span and intensity of three key
support attributes: event what happened?, effect what did the user experience?,
and requirement what support they need?. Next, we devise a hierarchical
taxonomy, CueTaxo, of support attributes for controlled question generation.
Further, we propose MH-COPILOT, a reinforcement learning-based system that
integrates (a) contextual attribute-span identification, (b) support attribute
intensity classification, (c) controlled question generation via a hierarchical
taxonomy, and (d) a verifier for reward modeling. Our model dynamically
assesses posts for the presence/absence of support attributes, and generates
targeted prompts to elicit missing information. Empirical results across four
notable language models demonstrate significant improvements in attribute
elicitation and user engagement. A human evaluation further validates the
model's effectiveness in real-world OMHC settings.

TL;DR: ReProCon是一个新颖的少样本生物医学命名实体识别框架，通过多原型建模、余弦对比学习和元学习，在数据稀缺和标签不平衡的情况下实现了接近BERT的性能，但内存使用更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学领域的命名实体识别面临数据稀缺和标签分布不平衡的挑战，特别是细粒度实体类型。需要开发能够在资源有限环境下有效工作的解决方案。

Method: 结合多原型建模（捕捉语义变异性）、余弦对比学习（确保类间分离）和Reptile元学习（快速适应少量数据），使用轻量级的fastText + BiLSTM编码器。

Result: 达到接近BERT基线的macro-F1分数（约99%的BERT性能），在30%标签预算下保持稳定，从19类扩展到50类时F1仅下降7.8%，优于SpanProto和CONTaiNER等基线方法。

Conclusion: ReProCon在资源受限环境下表现出最先进的性能，适合生物医学应用，多原型建模和对比学习对于处理类别不平衡至关重要。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in biomedical domains faces challenges due to
data scarcity and imbalanced label distributions, especially with fine-grained
entity types. We propose ReProCon, a novel few-shot NER framework that combines
multi-prototype modeling, cosine-contrastive learning, and Reptile
meta-learning to tackle these issues. By representing each category with
multiple prototypes, ReProCon captures semantic variability, such as synonyms
and contextual differences, while a cosine-contrastive objective ensures strong
interclass separation. Reptile meta-updates enable quick adaptation with little
data. Using a lightweight fastText + BiLSTM encoder with much lower memory
usage, ReProCon achieves a macro-$F_1$ score close to BERT-based baselines
(around 99 percent of BERT performance). The model remains stable with a label
budget of 30 percent and only drops 7.8 percent in $F_1$ when expanding from 19
to 50 categories, outperforming baselines such as SpanProto and CONTaiNER,
which see 10 to 32 percent degradation in Few-NERD. Ablation studies highlight
the importance of multi-prototype modeling and contrastive learning in managing
class imbalance. Despite difficulties with label ambiguity, ReProCon
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in resource-limited settings, making
it suitable for biomedical applications.

TL;DR: LLM会幻觉出人类不支持的虚假语法结构，行为探测和元语言探测方法都显示模型确实会幻觉构造。通过模拟假设测试发现，这些虚假假设会被高准确率确认，表明构造探测方法存在确认偏误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM是否会产生人类直觉不支持的虚假语法结构构造，以及这些幻觉构造如何影响语言学分析方法的有效性。

Method: 使用上下文嵌入的行为探测任务和基于提示的元语言探测任务，区分隐式和显式语言知识，并模拟假设测试来验证虚假构造假设。

Result: 两种方法都显示模型确实会幻觉构造，模拟测试显示虚假假设会被高准确率(overwhelmingly)确认，表明存在确认偏误问题。

Conclusion: 构造探测方法存在确认偏误风险，需要关注模型可能拥有的未知且不正确的句法知识，这对语言学分析方法提出了重要警示。

Abstract: This paper investigates false positive constructions: grammatical structures
which an LLM hallucinates as distinct constructions but which human
introspection does not support. Both a behavioural probing task using
contextual embeddings and a meta-linguistic probing task using prompts are
included, allowing us to distinguish between implicit and explicit linguistic
knowledge. Both methods reveal that models do indeed hallucinate constructions.
We then simulate hypothesis testing to determine what would have happened if a
linguist had falsely hypothesized that these hallucinated constructions do
exist. The high accuracy obtained shows that such false hypotheses would have
been overwhelmingly confirmed. This suggests that construction probing methods
suffer from a confirmation bias and raises the issue of what unknown and
incorrect syntactic knowledge these models also possess.

Motivation: 先前研究表明生成问题中的预设前提会引入未经验证的假设，导致声明验证不一致，同时提示敏感性仍然是LLMs面临的重要挑战，性能差异高达3-6%。

Method: 提出结构化鲁棒声明验证框架，通过无预设前提的分解问题进行推理。

Result: 在多个提示、数据集和LLMs上的广泛实验表明，即使最先进的模型仍然容易受到提示变异和预设前提的影响，而本文方法能够持续缓解这些问题。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了LLMs在声明验证中的提示敏感性和预设前提问题，实现了显著的性能改进。

Abstract: Prior work has shown that presupposition in generated questions can introduce
unverified assumptions, leading to inconsistencies in claim verification.
Additionally, prompt sensitivity remains a significant challenge for large
language models (LLMs), resulting in performance variance as high as 3-6%.
While recent advancements have reduced this gap, our study demonstrates that
prompt sensitivity remains a persistent issue. To address this, we propose a
structured and robust claim verification framework that reasons through
presupposition-free, decomposed questions. Extensive experiments across
multiple prompts, datasets, and LLMs reveal that even state-of-the-art models
remain susceptible to prompt variance and presupposition. Our method
consistently mitigates these issues, achieving up to a 2-5% improvement.

TL;DR: QR-Distill是一种知识蒸馏方法，通过质量过滤、条件路由和协作对等教学，有效提升小型模型从大型语言模型学习推理能力的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在资源受限场景部署受限，传统token级监督的知识蒸馏难以捕捉教师模型的完整推理过程，多路径方法中路径质量参差不齐且缺乏针对性。

Method: 提出QR-Distill框架：1）基于LLM评估的质量过滤保留正确推理路径；2）条件路由根据学生学习状态动态分配路径；3）协作对等教学让学生相互蒸馏多样见解。

Result: 实验证明QR-Distill优于传统单路径和多路径蒸馏方法，消融研究验证了质量过滤、条件路由和对等教学各组件的重要性。

Conclusion: QR-Distill通过综合质量过滤、动态路由和协作学习机制，有效解决了知识蒸馏中路径质量不均和学生个性化需求的问题，提升了小型模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) significantly enhance reasoning
capabilities but their deployment is restricted in resource-constrained
scenarios. Knowledge distillation addresses this by transferring knowledge from
powerful teacher models to compact and transparent students. However,
effectively capturing the teacher's comprehensive reasoning is challenging due
to conventional token-level supervision's limited scope. Using multiple
reasoning paths per query alleviates this problem, but treating each path
identically is suboptimal as paths vary widely in quality and suitability
across tasks and models. We propose Quality-filtered Routing with Cooperative
Distillation (QR-Distill), combining path quality filtering, conditional
routing, and cooperative peer teaching. First, quality filtering retains only
correct reasoning paths scored by an LLM-based evaluation. Second, conditional
routing dynamically assigns paths tailored to each student's current learning
state. Finally, cooperative peer teaching enables students to mutually distill
diverse insights, addressing knowledge gaps and biases toward specific
reasoning styles. Experiments demonstrate QR-Distill's superiority over
traditional single- and multi-path distillation methods. Ablation studies
further highlight the importance of each component including quality filtering,
conditional routing, and peer teaching in effective knowledge transfer. Our
code is available at https://github.com/LzyFischer/Distill.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型Transformer语言模型在各种下游任务中表现出色，但对其如何内化语言学知识的理解有限。需要跨语言的句法评估基准来促进语言模型的语言学能力研究。

Method: 使用QFrCoLA数据集和其他七个语言学二元可接受性判断语料库，对七个语言模型进行基准测试，比较微调Transformer模型和零样本大型语言模型的性能。

Result: 微调Transformer模型在大多数语言中表现强劲，而零样本二元分类大型语言模型表现较差。对于QFrCoLA基准，微调Transformer模型平均优于其他方法。预训练跨语言LLM在魁北克法语的语言判断能力方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: QFrCoLA是一个具有挑战性的数据集，能够有效评估语言模型的语言学判断能力，其构建基于语言学规范而非说话者感受，与语言学可接受性判断相似。

Abstract: Large and Transformer-based language models perform outstandingly in various
downstream tasks. However, there is limited understanding regarding how these
models internalize linguistic knowledge, so various linguistic benchmarks have
recently been proposed to facilitate syntactic evaluation of language models
across languages. This paper introduces QFrCoLA (Quebec-French Corpus of
Linguistic Acceptability Judgments), a normative binary acceptability judgments
dataset comprising 25,153 in-domain and 2,675 out-of-domain sentences. Our
study leverages the QFrCoLA dataset and seven other linguistic binary
acceptability judgment corpora to benchmark seven language models. The results
demonstrate that, on average, fine-tuned Transformer-based LM are strong
baselines for most languages and that zero-shot binary classification large
language models perform poorly on the task. However, for the QFrCoLA benchmark,
on average, a fine-tuned Transformer-based LM outperformed other methods
tested. It also shows that pre-trained cross-lingual LLMs selected for our
experimentation do not seem to have acquired linguistic judgment capabilities
during their pre-training for Quebec French. Finally, our experiment results on
QFrCoLA show that our dataset, built from examples that illustrate linguistic
norms rather than speakers' feelings, is similar to linguistic acceptability
judgment; it is a challenging dataset that can benchmark LM on their linguistic

### [213] [JUDGEBERT: Assessing Legal Meaning Preservation Between Sentences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16870)
*David Beauchemin,Michelle Albert-Rochette,Richard Khoury,Pierre-Luc Déziel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FrJUDGE数据集和JUDGEBERT评估指标用于评估法语法律文本简化中的语义保持，JUDGEBERT在相关性测试中优于现有指标并通过了完整性检查。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律文本简化需要确保语义准确保持，这在专业领域尤为重要，但现有评估指标在法语法域表现不足。

Method: 提出FrJUDGE数据集来评估法律文本间的语义保持，并开发JUDGEBERT这一新型评估指标专门针对法语法律文本简化。

Result: JUDGEBERT与人类判断的相关性优于现有指标，且通过了完整性检查（相同句子得100%，无关句子得0%）。

Conclusion: JUDGEBERT有潜力改变法律NLP应用，确保法律文本简化对专业人士和非专业人士的准确性和可访问性。

Abstract: Simplifying text while preserving its meaning is a complex yet essential
task, especially in sensitive domain applications like legal texts. When
applied to a specialized field, like the legal domain, preservation differs
significantly from its role in regular texts. This paper introduces FrJUDGE, a
new dataset to assess legal meaning preservation between two legal texts. It
also introduces JUDGEBERT, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess legal
meaning preservation in French legal text simplification. JUDGEBERT
demonstrates a superior correlation with human judgment compared to existing
metrics. It also passes two crucial sanity checks, while other metrics did not:
For two identical sentences, it always returns a score of 100%; on the other
hand, it returns 0% for two unrelated sentences. Our findings highlight its
potential to transform legal NLP applications, ensuring accuracy and
accessibility for text simplification for legal practitioners and lay users.

TL;DR: 提出了DreamCUB框架，通过构建对话世界模型来预测用户情感、情绪和意图，并应用基于模型的强化学习来提升对话系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 世界模型在机器人、游戏和自动驾驶领域广泛应用，但在自然语言任务中的应用相对有限。本文旨在将世界模型概念扩展到对话系统中，通过建模用户信念来提升对话质量。

Method: 定义POMDP（部分可观察马尔可夫决策过程），将情感、情绪和意图建模为用户信念，通过最大化信息瓶颈来解决。应用基于模型的强化学习框架，联合训练策略、评论家和对话世界模型。

Result: 预训练的对话世界模型在情感分类和情绪识别任务上达到最先进性能，对话质量通过联合训练得到提升。该方法在探索-利用平衡方面表现合理，并能很好地迁移到共情对话等域外场景。

Conclusion: DreamCUB框架成功地将世界模型概念应用于对话系统，通过用户信念建模显著提升了对话系统的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: World models have been widely utilized in robotics, gaming, and auto-driving.
However, their applications on natural language tasks are relatively limited.
In this paper, we construct the dialogue world model, which could predict the
user's emotion, sentiment, and intention, and future utterances. By defining a
POMDP, we argue emotion, sentiment and intention can be modeled as the user
belief and solved by maximizing the information bottleneck. By this user belief
modeling, we apply the model-based reinforcement learning framework to the
dialogue system, and propose a framework called DreamCUB. Experiments show that
the pretrained dialogue world model can achieve state-of-the-art performances
on emotion classification and sentiment identification, while dialogue quality
is also enhanced by joint training of the policy, critic and dialogue world
model. Further analysis shows that this manner holds a reasonable
exploration-exploitation balance and also transfers well to out-of-domain
scenarios such as empathetic dialogues.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OBJEX(MT)基准测试评估LLM在多轮越狱对话中提取目标的能力和置信度校准，结果显示现有模型在目标推断上准确率有限且过度自信


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM作为模型评判者时能否可靠推断对话中的潜在目标，特别是在多轮越狱攻击这种目标分散在嘈杂对抗性对话中的场景

Method: 引入OBJEX(MT)基准，要求模型将对话转录提炼为单句基础目标并报告置信度，使用语义相似度评分准确率，通过校准阈值评估正确性，并用ECE、Brier分数等指标评估元认知

Result: Claude-Sonnet-4表现最佳（准确率0.515，校准ECE 0.296），GPT-4.1和Qwen3准确率0.441但过度自信（平均置信度约0.88 vs 准确率约0.44），不同数据集性能差异显著（0.167-0.865）

Conclusion: LLM评判者在多轮越狱中经常高置信度地错误推断目标，建议提供明确目标说明并使用选择性预测或弃权来管理风险

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges of other models,
yet it is unclear whether a judge can reliably infer the latent objective of
the conversation it evaluates, especially when the goal is distributed across
noisy, adversarial, multi-turn jailbreaks. We introduce OBJEX(MT), a benchmark
that requires a model to (i) distill a transcript into a single-sentence base
objective and (ii) report its own confidence. Accuracy is scored by an LLM
judge using semantic similarity between extracted and gold objectives;
correctness uses a single human-aligned threshold calibrated once on N=100
items (tau* = 0.61); and metacognition is evaluated with ECE, Brier score,
Wrong@High-Conf, and risk-coverage curves. We evaluate gpt-4.1,
claude-sonnet-4, and Qwen3-235B-A22B-FP8 on SafeMT Attack_600, SafeMTData_1K,
MHJ, and CoSafe. claude-sonnet-4 attains the highest objective-extraction
accuracy (0.515) and the best calibration (ECE 0.296; Brier 0.324), while
gpt-4.1 and Qwen3 tie at 0.441 accuracy yet show marked overconfidence (mean
confidence approx. 0.88 vs. accuracy approx. 0.44; Wrong@0.90 approx. 48-52%).
Performance varies sharply across datasets (approx. 0.167-0.865), with MHJ
comparatively easy and Attack_600/CoSafe harder. These results indicate that
LLM judges often misinfer objectives with high confidence in multi-turn
jailbreaks and suggest operational guidance: provide judges with explicit
objectives when possible and use selective prediction or abstention to manage
risk. We release prompts, scoring templates, and complete logs to facilitate
replication and analysis.

TL;DR: 提出条件前门提示(CFD-Prompting)框架，通过构建反事实外部知识来消除LLM内部偏见，实现查询与答案间因果效应的无偏估计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在知识密集型任务中表现不佳，现有方法如RAG和CoT仍受内部偏见影响导致错误答案，需要解决因果推理中的偏见问题

Method: 基于因果推理框架，构建反事实外部知识来模拟查询在不同上下文中的行为，使用条件前门调整方法在较弱假设下进行无偏估计

Result: 在多个LLM和基准数据集上的实验表明，CFD-Prompting在准确性和鲁棒性方面显著优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: CFD-Prompting框架有效解决了LLM内部偏见问题，增强了推理过程的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为知识密集型任务提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in natural
language processing but still struggle to perform well on knowledge-intensive
tasks that require deep reasoning and the integration of external knowledge.
Although methods such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have been proposed to enhance LLMs with external
knowledge, they still suffer from internal bias in LLMs, which often leads to
incorrect answers. In this paper, we propose a novel causal prompting
framework, Conditional Front-Door Prompting (CFD-Prompting), which enables the
unbiased estimation of the causal effect between the query and the answer,
conditional on external knowledge, while mitigating internal bias. By
constructing counterfactual external knowledge, our framework simulates how the
query behaves under varying contexts, addressing the challenge that the query
is fixed and is not amenable to direct causal intervention. Compared to the
standard front-door adjustment, the conditional variant operates under weaker
assumptions, enhancing both robustness and generalisability of the reasoning
process. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmark datasets
demonstrate that CFD-Prompting significantly outperforms existing baselines in
both accuracy and robustness.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了情感幻觉的概念，并开发了AHaBench基准和AHaPairs数据集来诊断和缓解LLM在情感敏感交互中产生的虚假情感连接风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在情感敏感交互中被广泛使用，其模拟的共情能力可能产生虚假的情感连接幻觉，存在心理安全风险。

Method: 构建了包含500个心理健康相关提示的AHaBench基准和5K实例的AHaPairs偏好数据集，采用直接偏好优化(DPO)进行模型对齐。

Result: DPO微调显著减少了情感幻觉，同时不损害核心推理和知识性能，人类-模型一致性分析验证了AHaBench的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究确立了情感幻觉作为一个独特的安全问题，并为开发既事实可靠又心理安全的LLM提供了实用资源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in emotionally sensitive
interactions, where their simulated empathy can create the illusion of genuine
relational connection. We define this risk as Affective Hallucination, the
production of emotionally immersive responses that foster illusory social
presence despite the model's lack of affective capacity. To systematically
diagnose and mitigate this risk, we introduce AHaBench, a benchmark of 500
mental health-related prompts with expert-informed reference responses,
evaluated along three dimensions: Emotional Enmeshment, Illusion of Presence,
and Fostering Overdependence. We further release AHaPairs, a 5K-instance
preference dataset enabling Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for alignment
with emotionally responsible behavior. Experiments across multiple model
families show that DPO fine-tuning substantially reduces affective
hallucination without degrading core reasoning and knowledge performance.
Human-model agreement analyses confirm that AHaBench reliably captures
affective hallucination, validating it as an effective diagnostic tool. This
work establishes affective hallucination as a distinct safety concern and
provides practical resources for developing LLMs that are not only factually
reliable but also psychologically safe. AHaBench and AHaPairs are accessible
via https://huggingface.co/datasets/o0oMiNGo0o/AHaBench, and code for
fine-tuning and evaluation are in https://github.com/0oOMiNGOo0/AHaBench.
Warning: This paper contains examples of mental health-related language that
may be emotionally distressing.

TL;DR: 本文提出KnowProb方法，通过知识引导的后验解释方式探测PLM是否理解文本背后的隐含知识，发现当前PLM在捕获隐藏知识方面仍面临挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型虽然具有强大推理能力，但其黑盒特性带来的可信度问题日益凸显，需要开发解释性方法来探测模型是否真正理解文本隐含知识

Method: 提出KnowProb知识引导探测方法，提供六种潜在解释（3种基于知识的理解和3种基于关联的推理），以事后解释方式探测黑盒PLM

Result: 验证发现当前PLM仅学习单一表示分布，在捕获文本背后隐藏知识方面仍面临重大挑战，证明该方法能从多角度有效识别现有黑盒模型的局限性

Conclusion: KnowProb方法有助于促进以可解释方式检测黑盒模型的研究，为提升PLM的可信度和透明度提供有效工具

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are trained on large amounts of unlabeled
data, yet they exhibit remarkable reasoning skills. However, the
trustworthiness challenges posed by these black-box models have become
increasingly evident in recent years. To alleviate this problem, this paper
proposes a novel Knowledge-guided Probing approach called KnowProb in a
post-hoc explanation way, which aims to probe whether black-box PLMs understand
implicit knowledge beyond the given text, rather than focusing only on the
surface level content of the text. We provide six potential explanations
derived from the underlying content of the given text, including three
knowledge-based understanding and three association-based reasoning. In
experiments, we validate that current small-scale (or large-scale) PLMs only
learn a single distribution of representation, and still face significant
challenges in capturing the hidden knowledge behind a given text. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective for identifying the
limitations of existing black-box models from multiple probing perspectives,
which facilitates researchers to promote the study of detecting black-box
models in an explainable way.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然AI对齐（主要通过RLHF）是大语言模型训练的关键步骤，但当前研究多集中在计算技术方面，对价值设定和数据使用等更广泛的问题关注不够。

Method: 调查分析5家领先组织的6个LLM开发项目的公开文档，包括专有模型（OpenAI GPT、Anthropic Claude、Google Gemini）和开放模型（Meta Llama、Google Gemma、Alibaba Qwen），从价值设定和数据中心角度进行审计。

Result: 对每个项目进行了详细的审计记录，并从价值设定和数据中心角度提供了总体总结，揭示了当前对齐实践的具体情况。

Conclusion: 基于调查结果，讨论了一系列更广泛的相关问题，强调了对齐过程在价值选择和数据管理方面需要更多关注。

Abstract: AI Alignment, primarily in the form of Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF), has been a cornerstone of the post-training phase in
developing Large Language Models (LLMs). It has also been a popular research
topic across various disciplines beyond Computer Science, including Philosophy
and Law, among others, highlighting the socio-technical challenges involved.
Nonetheless, except for the computational techniques related to alignment,
there has been limited focus on the broader picture: the scope of these
processes, which primarily rely on the selected objectives (values), and the
data collected and used to imprint such objectives into the models. This work
aims to reveal how alignment is understood and applied in practice from a
value-setting and data-centric perspective. For this purpose, we investigate
and survey (`audit') publicly available documentation released by 6 LLM
development initiatives by 5 leading organizations shaping this technology,
focusing on proprietary (OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini) and
open-weight (Meta's Llama, Google's Gemma, and Alibaba's Qwen) initiatives, all
published in the last 3 years. The findings are documented in detail per
initiative, while there is also an overall summary concerning different
aspects, mainly from a value-setting and data-centric perspective. On the basis
of our findings, we discuss a series of broader related concerns.

TL;DR: ReFactX是一种无需检索器或辅助模型的方法，通过约束生成和前缀树索引让LLM直接访问外部知识，可扩展到8亿个事实的大规模知识库。


<details>

Motivation: 解决LLM的知识鸿沟和幻觉问题，现有RAG和工具使用等方法依赖额外模型和服务，导致复杂管道、错误传播和高token处理成本。

Method: 使用知识图谱三元组文本化后构建前缀树索引，在推理时通过约束生成只允许生成已存在的事实序列来获取外部知识。

Result: 在问答任务上验证，方法可扩展到大规模知识库（8亿事实），适应领域特定数据，效果显著且生成时间开销极小。

Conclusion: ReFactX提供了一种可扩展、高效的外部知识访问方案，无需依赖复杂的外部组件，有效解决了LLM的知识局限性问题。

Abstract: Knowledge gaps and hallucinations are persistent challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs), which generate unreliable responses when lacking the
necessary information to fulfill user instructions. Existing approaches, such
as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool use, aim to address these
issues by incorporating external knowledge. Yet, they rely on additional models
or services, resulting in complex pipelines, potential error propagation, and
often requiring the model to process a large number of tokens. In this paper,
we present a scalable method that enables LLMs to access external knowledge
without depending on retrievers or auxiliary models. Our approach uses
constrained generation with a pre-built prefix-tree index. Triples from a
Knowledge Graph are verbalized in textual facts, tokenized, and indexed in a
prefix tree for efficient access. During inference, to acquire external
knowledge, the LLM generates facts with constrained generation which allows
only sequences of tokens that form an existing fact. We evaluate our proposal
on Question Answering and show that it scales to large knowledge bases (800
million facts), adapts to domain-specific data, and achieves effective results.
These gains come with minimal generation-time overhead. ReFactX code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了GRADE评估框架，通过推理深度和语义距离两个维度来评估RAG系统在多步推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统评估忽略了真实场景中的结构复杂性和多步推理需求，特别是检索难度与推理深度之间的交互关系。

Method: 从新闻文章构建知识图谱，通过语义聚类恢复缺失链接，生成难度可控的多跳QA数据集，建立2D难度矩阵结合生成器和检索器难度。

Result: 实验表明错误率与难度度量强相关，验证了诊断效用。

Conclusion: GRADE框架能够对RAG性能进行细粒度分析，为评估和改进现实应用中的多跳推理提供了可扩展基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are widely adopted in
knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, but current evaluations often overlook the
structural complexity and multi-step reasoning required in real-world
scenarios. These benchmarks overlook key factors such as the interaction
between retrieval difficulty and reasoning depth. To address this gap, we
propose \textsc{GRADE}, a novel evaluation framework that models task
difficulty along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) reasoning depth, defined by the
number of inference steps (hops), and (2) semantic distance between the query
and its supporting evidence. We construct a synthetic multi-hop QA dataset from
factual news articles by extracting knowledge graphs and augmenting them
through semantic clustering to recover missing links, allowing us to generate
diverse and difficulty-controlled queries. Central to our framework is a 2D
difficulty matrix that combines generator-side and retriever-side difficulty.
Experiments across multiple domains and models show that error rates strongly
correlate with our difficulty measures, validating their diagnostic utility.
\textsc{GRADE} enables fine-grained analysis of RAG performance and provides a
scalable foundation for evaluating and improving multi-hop reasoning in
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeAR是一个开源的文档重排序框架，采用双阶段方法：第一阶段通过知识蒸馏获得细粒度相关性评分，第二阶段通过LoRA适配器进行列表推理，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文档重排序中难以同时平衡细粒度相关性评分和整体跨文档分析，需要一种能够解耦这两项任务的方法。

Method: 双阶段方法：第一阶段使用冻结的13B LLaMA教师模型通过交叉熵、RankNet和KL散度损失将token级相关性信号蒸馏到紧凑的{3,8}B学生模型中；第二阶段附加第二个LoRA适配器，在20K GPT-4o生成的思维链排列上进行微调，实现列表推理。

Result: 在TREC-DL19/20、8个BEIR数据集和NovelEval-2306上，DeAR在DL20上比开源基线提升+5.1 nDCG@5，在NovelEval上达到90.97 nDCG@10，超越GPT-4 +3.09。在开放域QA中达到54.29 Top-1准确率。

Conclusion: DeAR通过双损失蒸馏确保稳定校准，为现代重排序系统提供了高效且可解释的解决方案，在多个任务中均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed listwise document reranking by
enabling global reasoning over candidate sets, yet single models often struggle
to balance fine-grained relevance scoring with holistic cross-document
analysis. We propose \textbf{De}ep\textbf{A}gent\textbf{R}ank (\textbf{\DeAR}),
an open-source framework that decouples these tasks through a dual-stage
approach, achieving superior accuracy and interpretability. In \emph{Stage 1},
we distill token-level relevance signals from a frozen 13B LLaMA teacher into a
compact \{3, 8\}B student model using a hybrid of cross-entropy, RankNet, and
KL divergence losses, ensuring robust pointwise scoring. In \emph{Stage 2}, we
attach a second LoRA adapter and fine-tune on 20K GPT-4o-generated
chain-of-thought permutations, enabling listwise reasoning with
natural-language justifications. Evaluated on TREC-DL19/20, eight BEIR
datasets, and NovelEval-2306, \DeAR surpasses open-source baselines by +5.1
nDCG@5 on DL20 and achieves 90.97 nDCG@10 on NovelEval, outperforming GPT-4 by
+3.09. Without fine-tuning on Wikipedia, DeAR also excels in open-domain QA,
achieving 54.29 Top-1 accuracy on Natural Questions, surpassing baselines like
MonoT5, UPR, and RankGPT. Ablations confirm that dual-loss distillation ensures
stable calibration, making \DeAR a highly effective and interpretable solution
for modern reranking systems.\footnote{Dataset and code available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO算法虽然经验上有效，但其启发式动机和对KL散度约束的临时处理方式缺乏理论依据，需要开发更理论严谨的方法。

Method: 开发了KL正则化Q学习（KLQ）方法，这是一种新的动作价值RL方法，专门针对LM-RLHF设置设计。

Result: KLQ在优化LM-RLHF目标方面与PPO表现相当，但在LLM作为评判的评估中始终获得更高的胜率。

Conclusion: KLQ提供了与PPO等效但理论更严谨的替代方案，在语言生成任务中展现出更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) is an established and effective policy
gradient algorithm used for Language Model Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (LM-RLHF). PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic
motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an
ad-hoc manner. In this paper, we develop a a new action-value RL method for the
LM-RLHF setting, KL-regularised Q-Learning (KLQ). We then show that our method
is equivalent to a version of PPO in a certain specific sense, despite its very
different motivation. Finally, we benchmark KLQ on two key language generation
tasks -- summarisation and single-turn dialogue. We demonstrate that KLQ
performs on-par with PPO at optimising the LM-RLHF objective, and achieves a
consistently higher win-rate against PPO on LLM-as-a-judge evaluations.

Motivation: 现有的表格理解方法（如思维链和问题分解）缺乏显式长期规划和弱步骤间连接，导致在处理复杂问题时容易遗漏约束条件。

Method: 利用大语言模型的长期规划能力，设计紧密连接的步骤来执行长期计划，确保各步骤服务于最终目标，同时减少不必要细节的包含。

Conclusion: 通过利用大语言模型的长期规划能力，可以显著提升表格理解任务的性能，特别是在处理需要多步操作的复杂问题时。

Abstract: Table understanding is key to addressing challenging downstream tasks such as
table-based question answering and fact verification. Recent works have focused
on leveraging Chain-of-Thought and question decomposition to solve complex
questions requiring multiple operations on tables. However, these methods often
suffer from a lack of explicit long-term planning and weak inter-step
connections, leading to miss constraints within questions. In this paper, we
propose leveraging the long-term planning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) to enhance table understanding. Our approach enables the execution of a
long-term plan, where the steps are tightly interconnected and serve the
ultimate goal, an aspect that methods based on Chain-of-Thought and question
decomposition lack. In addition, our method effectively minimizes the inclusion
of unnecessary details in the process of solving the next short-term goals, a
limitation of methods based on Chain-of-Thought. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on WikiTableQuestions and TabFact datasets.

Abstract: Every year, most educational institutions seek and receive an enormous volume
of text feedback from students on courses, teaching, and overall experience.
Yet, turning this raw feedback into useful insights is far from
straightforward. It has been a long-standing challenge to adopt automatic
opinion mining solutions for such education review text data due to the content
complexity and low-granularity reporting requirements. Aspect-based Sentiment
Analysis (ABSA) offers a promising solution with its rich, sub-sentence-level
opinion mining capabilities. However, existing ABSA research and resources are
very heavily focused on the commercial domain. In education, they are scarce
and hard to develop due to limited public datasets and strict data protection.
A high-quality, annotated dataset is urgently needed to advance research in
this under-resourced area. In this work, we present EduRABSA (Education Review
ABSA), the first public, annotated ABSA education review dataset that covers
three review subject types (course, teaching staff, university) in the English
language and all main ABSA tasks, including the under-explored implicit aspect
and implicit opinion extraction. We also share ASQE-DPT (Data Processing Tool),
an offline, lightweight, installation-free manual data annotation tool that
generates labelled datasets for comprehensive ABSA tasks from a single-task
annotation. Together, these resources contribute to the ABSA community and
education domain by removing the dataset barrier, supporting research
transparency and reproducibility, and enabling the creation and sharing of
further resources. The dataset, annotation tool, and scripts and statistics for
dataset processing and sampling are available at

Motivation: 现有表格理解方法面临表格内容的不可预测性、上下文信息缺失以及大语言模型推理困难等挑战

Method: 提出实体导向的搜索方法，利用问题与表格数据的语义相似性和表格单元格间的隐式关系，首次将图语言查询用于表格理解

Result: 在WikiTableQuestions和TabFact标准测试集上达到了新的最高水平

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了表格理解的性能，为该领域开启了新的研究方向

Abstract: Our work addresses the challenges of understanding tables. Existing methods
often struggle with the unpredictable nature of table content, leading to a
reliance on preprocessing and keyword matching. They also face limitations due
to the lack of contextual information, which complicates the reasoning
processes of large language models (LLMs). To overcome these challenges, we
introduce an entity-oriented search method to improve table understanding with
LLMs. This approach effectively leverages the semantic similarities between
questions and table data, as well as the implicit relationships between table
cells, minimizing the need for data preprocessing and keyword matching.
Additionally, it focuses on table entities, ensuring that table cells are
semantically tightly bound, thereby enhancing contextual clarity. Furthermore,
we pioneer the use of a graph query language for table understanding,
establishing a new research direction. Experiments show that our approach
achieves new state-of-the-art performances on standard benchmarks

TL;DR: GRAID是一种新颖的数据增强方法，通过几何控制和多智能体反射过程，利用大语言模型解决有害文本分类中的数据稀缺问题，显著提升防护模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决防护应用中有害文本分类面临的数据稀缺问题，需要可靠的数据增强方法来提升模型性能。

Method: GRAID包含两个阶段：1）使用约束LLM生成几何控制的样本；2）通过多智能体反射过程进行增强，促进风格多样性并发现边缘案例。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上验证，使用GRAID增强的有害文本分类数据集显著提高了下游防护模型的性能。

Conclusion: GRAID能够可靠覆盖输入空间并细致探索有害内容，是解决有害文本分类数据稀缺问题的有效方法。

Abstract: We address the problem of data scarcity in harmful text classification for
guardrailing applications and introduce GRAID (Geometric and Reflective
AI-Driven Data Augmentation), a novel pipeline that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) for dataset augmentation. GRAID consists of two stages: (i)
generation of geometrically controlled examples using a constrained LLM, and
(ii) augmentation through a multi-agentic reflective process that promotes
stylistic diversity and uncovers edge cases. This combination enables both
reliable coverage of the input space and nuanced exploration of harmful
content. Using two benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that augmenting a
harmful text classification dataset with GRAID leads to significant
improvements in downstream guardrail model performance.

TL;DR: 通过探索语言共享神经元和构建语言桥梁机制，BridgeX-ICL方法在不需精调的情况下提升了大语言模型在低资源语言上的零样本跨语言学习性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在低资源语言上性能提升困难，需要一种不需精调的数据高效方法

Method: 通过MUSE双语词典构建神经元探针数据，定义语言重叠神经元子集，采用HSIC基准指标量化模型内部语言谱，按此选择最优语言桥梁

Result: 在2个跨语言任务和15个语言对上进行实验（涵盖高-低和中-低语言对），验证了BridgeX-ICL的有效性

Conclusion: 方法不仅提升了低资源语言的零样本学习性能，还为理解LLM的多语言机制提供了实证见解

Abstract: The current Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in
improving performance on low-resource languages and urgently need
data-efficient methods without costly fine-tuning. From the perspective of
language-bridge, we propose BridgeX-ICL, a simple yet effective method to
improve zero-shot Cross-lingual In-Context Learning (X-ICL) for low-resource
languages. Unlike existing works focusing on language-specific neurons,
BridgeX-ICL explores whether sharing neurons can improve cross-lingual
performance in LLMs or not. We construct neuron probe data from the
ground-truth MUSE bilingual dictionaries, and define a subset of language
overlap neurons accordingly, to ensure full activation of these anchored
neurons. Subsequently, we propose an HSIC-based metric to quantify LLMs'
internal linguistic spectrum based on overlap neurons, which guides optimal
bridge selection. The experiments conducted on 2 cross-lingual tasks and 15
language pairs from 7 diverse families (covering both high-low and moderate-low
pairs) validate the effectiveness of BridgeX-ICL and offer empirical insights
into the underlying multilingual mechanisms of LLMs.

Motivation: 探索转换器模型中标记表征的变化过程，以及位置偏置如何影响标记的区分性，理解模型内部工作机制。

Method: 通过层次相似性分析和受控实验，系统性地检验标记在处理过程中的软化现象和位置偏置的作用。

Result: 证实标记在处理过程中系统性地失去特异性，尤其在偏向极端位置时更为显著，同时确认了同质化现象的存在和其对位置注意机制的依赖性。

Conclusion: 论文证明了标记同质化是转换器模型中的重要现象，位置偏置机制在增强这种效应中起关键作用，这为理解和改进模型表征学习提供了见解。

Abstract: This paper investigates token homogenization - the convergence of token
representations toward uniformity across transformer layers and its
relationship to positional bias in large language models. We empirically
examine whether homogenization occurs and how positional bias amplifies this
effect. Through layer-wise similarity analysis and controlled experiments, we
demonstrate that tokens systematically lose distinctiveness during processing,
particularly when biased toward extremal positions. Our findings confirm both
the existence of homogenization and its dependence on positional attention
mechanisms.

TL;DR: 结合Transformer注意力机制和自然语言推理模型，通过注意力分数筛选上下文相关句子，再用NLI分类前提和矛盾关系


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在权衡：Transformer注意力能识别文本连接但缺乏语义标签，NLI能分类句子关系但缺乏上下文显著性

Method: 流水线方法：先通过聚合token级注意力分数识别与目标句子相关的候选句子，再用预训练NLI模型分类每个候选为前提或矛盾，最后用注意力显著性分数过滤NLI识别的关系

Result: 能够高效地隔离文本中任何给定主张的最重要语义关系

Conclusion: 该方法结合了注意力机制和NLI的优势，为目标分析提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Finding the relationships between sentences in a document is crucial for
tasks like fact-checking, argument mining, and text summarization. A key
challenge is to identify which sentences act as premises or contradictions for
a specific claim. Existing methods often face a trade-off: transformer
attention mechanisms can identify salient textual connections but lack explicit
semantic labels, while Natural Language Inference (NLI) models can classify
relationships between sentence pairs but operate independently of contextual
saliency. In this work, we introduce a method that combines the strengths of
both approaches for a targeted analysis. Our pipeline first identifies
candidate sentences that are contextually relevant to a user-selected target
sentence by aggregating token-level attention scores. It then uses a pretrained
NLI model to classify each candidate as a premise (entailment) or
contradiction. By filtering NLI-identified relationships with attention-based
saliency scores, our method efficiently isolates the most significant semantic
relationships for any given claim in a text.

TL;DR: 标题框架对用户后续搜索行为有显著影响，冲突和策略框架会干扰与先前选择的一致性，而情景框架比主题框架产生更具体的查询


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究搜索引擎中标题框架如何影响用户的信息搜索行为，虽然框架效应对判断的影响已有研究，但对后续搜索行为的影响了解较少

Method: 进行受控实验，参与者根据特定语言框架过滤的标题发出查询并进行选择

Result: 标题框架显著影响后续查询，冲突和策略框架破坏与先前选择的一致性，情景框架比主题框架产生更具体的查询，观察到适度的短期框架持续性但随时间下降

Conclusion: 即使短暂接触框架也能显著改变用户信息寻求行为的方向

Abstract: Search engines play a central role in how people gather information, but
subtle cues like headline framing may influence not only what users believe but
also how they search. While framing effects on judgment are well documented,
their impact on subsequent search behavior is less understood. We conducted a
controlled experiment where participants issued queries and selected from
headlines filtered by specific linguistic frames. Headline framing
significantly shaped follow-up queries: conflict and strategy frames disrupted
alignment with prior selections, while episodic frames led to more concrete
queries than thematic ones. We also observed modest short-term frame
persistence that declined over time. These results suggest that even brief
exposure to framing can meaningfully alter the direction of users
information-seeking behavior.

Method: 引入语言级别的地理位置信息作为辅助任务，将预测的地理位置向量作为条件信号注入到中间表示中，通过显式条件化促使模型学习更统一的方言和口音表示

Result: 在六个多语言数据集上的实验表明，该方法提高了对语言内部变化和未见域的鲁棒性，在FLEURS数据集上达到97.7%的准确率，在ML-SUPERB 2.0方言集上相对提升9.7%

Conclusion: 地理位置感知的语言识别方法通过引入地理位置信息作为条件信号，有效提升了模型对同一语言不同方言和口音的识别一致性，实现了新的最先进性能

Abstract: While Self-supervised Learning (SSL) has significantly improved Spoken
Language Identification (LID), existing models often struggle to consistently
classify dialects and accents of the same language as a unified class. To
address this challenge, we propose geolocation-aware LID, a novel approach that
incorporates language-level geolocation information into the SSL-based LID
model. Specifically, we introduce geolocation prediction as an auxiliary task
and inject the predicted vectors into intermediate representations as
conditioning signals. This explicit conditioning encourages the model to learn
more unified representations for dialectal and accented variations. Experiments
across six multilingual datasets demonstrate that our approach improves
robustness to intra-language variations and unseen domains, achieving new
state-of-the-art accuracy on FLEURS (97.7%) and 9.7% relative improvement on
ML-SUPERB 2.0 dialect set.

Motivation: 虽然变换器语言模型在自然语言推理领域取得了进步，但从逻辑角度看，满足性问题的计算复杂性类别和语法构造异质性对模型学习能力的影响尚未得到充分讨论。

Method: 研究不同计算复杂性类别和语法构造的问题实例对TLMs学习推理规则能力的影响，并进行实证研究来探索满足性问题的分布情况。

Result: 文章没有提供具体的实验结果，但提出了一种系统化的研究框架来分析TLMs在不同逻辑复杂性条件下的表现。

Conclusion: 这项研究填补了自然语言满足性问题研究中的重要空白，为更准确评估变换器语言模型的推理能力提供了理论基础和实证支撑。

Abstract: Efforts to apply transformer-based language models (TLMs) to the problem of
reasoning in natural language have enjoyed ever-increasing success in recent
years. The most fundamental task in this area to which nearly all others can be
reduced is that of determining satisfiability. However, from a logical point of
view, satisfiability problems vary along various dimensions, which may affect
TLMs' ability to learn how to solve them. The problem instances of
satisfiability in natural language can belong to different computational
complexity classes depending on the language fragment in which they are
expressed. Although prior research has explored the problem of natural language
satisfiability, the above-mentioned point has not been discussed adequately.
Hence, we investigate how problem instances from varying computational
complexity classes and having different grammatical constructs impact TLMs'
ability to learn rules of inference. Furthermore, to faithfully evaluate TLMs,
we conduct an empirical study to explore the distribution of satisfiability
problems.

Method: 开发包含性能实现比率、变异系数和语言潜力三个指标的分析框架，通过对13个模型变体和11个多语言数据集的案例研究进行验证

Result: 该框架提供了更可靠的模型性能和语言差异测量，特别是在低资源语言评估方面表现突出，发现更高整体模型性能不一定意味着跨语言公平性更好

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够更深入地揭示多语言模型评估中的性能差异，为低资源语言评估提供了有效工具，挑战了传统评估方法的局限性

Abstract: Results reported in large-scale multilingual evaluations are often fragmented
and confounded by factors such as target languages, differences in experimental
setups, and model choices. We propose a framework that disentangles these
confounding variables and introduces three interpretable metrics--the
performance realisation ratio, its coefficient of variation, and language
potential--enabling a finer-grained and more insightful quantification of
actual performance disparities across both (i) models and (ii) languages.
Through a case study of 13 model variants on 11 multilingual datasets, we
demonstrate that our framework provides a more reliable measurement of model
performance and language disparities, particularly for low-resource languages,
which have so far proven challenging to evaluate. Importantly, our results
reveal that higher overall model performance does not necessarily imply greater
fairness across languages.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在考虑标注者角色视角的情况下进行仇恨言论和侮辱性内容标注的能力，评估LLM生成标注与现有标注者建模技术的对比。

Method: 使用预定义的标注者角色在强到弱数据视角主义光谱下，评估LLM生成的标注，并与现有标注者建模技术进行对比分析。

Result: LLM能够选择性使用人口统计特征，识别出典型标注者模式。在弱数据视角主义下，不依赖标注者信息的建模技术表现优于强视角主义和人类标注；在强视角主义个性化数据集上，LLM标注接近但未超越人类表现。

Conclusion: LLM生成的视角倾向于聚合，尽管使用了主观提示。对于强视角主义的个性化数据集，LLM标注者建模性能接近人类但未超越，表明LLM在视角标注方面具有潜力但仍有局限。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
annotate hate speech and abusiveness while considering predefined annotator
personas within the strong-to-weak data perspectivism spectra. We evaluated
LLM-generated annotations against existing annotator modeling techniques for
perspective modeling. Our findings show that LLMs selectively use demographic
attributes from the personas. We identified prototypical annotators, with
persona features that show varying degrees of alignment with the original human
annotators. Within the data perspectivism paradigm, annotator modeling
techniques that do not explicitly rely on annotator information performed
better under weak data perspectivism compared to both strong data perspectivism
and human annotations, suggesting LLM-generated views tend towards aggregation
despite subjective prompting. However, for more personalized datasets tailored
to strong perspectivism, the performance of LLM annotator modeling approached,
but did not exceed, human annotators.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is a pivotal technique for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human intentions, safety constraints, and domain-specific
requirements. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the full
pipeline, encompassing (i) data collection methodologies, (ii) full-parameter
and parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies, and (iii) evaluation protocols.
We categorized data construction into three major paradigms: expert annotation,
distillation from larger models, and self-improvement mechanisms, each offering
distinct trade-offs between quality, scalability, and resource cost.
Fine-tuning techniques range from conventional supervised training to
lightweight approaches, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and prefix tuning,
with a focus on computational efficiency and model reusability. We further
examine the challenges of evaluating faithfulness, utility, and safety across
multilingual and multimodal scenarios, highlighting the emergence of
domain-specific benchmarks in healthcare, legal, and financial applications.
Finally, we discuss promising directions for automated data generation,
adaptive optimization, and robust evaluation frameworks, arguing that a closer
integration of data, algorithms, and human feedback is essential for advancing
instruction-tuned LLMs. This survey aims to serve as a practical reference for
researchers and practitioners seeking to design LLMs that are both effective
and reliably aligned with human intentions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive level of general
knowledge. However, they often struggle in highly specialized and
cost-sensitive domains such as drug discovery and rare disease research due to
the lack of expert knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
(PU-ADKA) designed to efficiently enhance domain-specific LLMs by actively
engaging domain experts within a fixed budget. Unlike traditional fine-tuning
approaches, PU-ADKA selectively identifies and queries the most appropriate
expert from a team, taking into account each expert's availability, knowledge
boundaries, and consultation costs. We train PU-ADKA using simulations on
PubMed data and validate it through both controlled expert interactions and
real-world deployment with a drug development team, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LLM performance in specialized domains under strict
budget constraints. In addition to outlining our methodological innovations and
experimental results, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, CKAD, for
cost-effective LLM domain knowledge acquisition to foster further research in
this challenging area.

Conclusion: SSFO为RAG系统提供了一种高效、低成本的自盛盛对齐方法，通过概率质量转移机制有效解决了幻觉问题，且具有良好的泛化性能

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate responses that are faithful to the retrieved context.
However, faithfulness hallucination remains a critical challenge, as existing
methods often require costly supervision and post-training or significant
inference burdens. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Self-Supervised
Faithfulness Optimization (SSFO), the first self-supervised alignment approach
for enhancing RAG faithfulness. SSFO constructs preference data pairs by
contrasting the model's outputs generated with and without the context.
Leveraging Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), SSFO aligns model faithfulness
without incurring labeling costs or additional inference burden. We
theoretically and empirically demonstrate that SSFO leverages a benign form of
\emph{likelihood displacement}, transferring probability mass from
parametric-based tokens to context-aligned tokens. Based on this insight, we
propose a modified DPO loss function to encourage likelihood displacement.
Comprehensive evaluations show that SSFO significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art faithfulness on multiple context-based
question-answering datasets. Notably, SSFO exhibits strong generalization,
improving cross-lingual faithfulness and preserving general
instruction-following capabilities. We release our code and model at the

Abstract: Legal claims refer to the plaintiff's demands in a case and are essential to
guiding judicial reasoning and case resolution. While many works have focused
on improving the efficiency of legal professionals, the research on helping
non-professionals (e.g., plaintiffs) remains unexplored. This paper explores
the problem of legal claim generation based on the given case's facts. First,
we construct ClaimGen-CN, the first dataset for Chinese legal claim generation
task, from various real-world legal disputes. Additionally, we design an
evaluation metric tailored for assessing the generated claims, which
encompasses two essential dimensions: factuality and clarity. Building on this,
we conduct a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art general and
legal-domain large language models. Our findings highlight the limitations of
the current models in factual precision and expressive clarity, pointing to the
need for more targeted development in this domain. To encourage further
exploration of this important task, we will make the dataset publicly
available.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in automatic bundle
generation but suffer from prohibitive computational costs. Although knowledge
distillation offers a pathway to more efficient student models, our preliminary
study reveals that naively integrating diverse types of distilled knowledge
from teacher LLMs into student LLMs leads to knowledge conflict, negatively
impacting the performance of bundle generation. To address this, we propose
RouteDK, a framework for routing distilled knowledge through a mixture of LoRA
expert architecture. Specifically, we first distill knowledge from the teacher
LLM for bundle generation in two complementary types: high-level knowledge
(generalizable rules) and fine-grained knowledge (session-specific reasoning).
We then train knowledge-specific LoRA experts for each type of knowledge
together with a base LoRA expert. For effective integration, we propose a
dynamic fusion module, featuring an input-aware router, where the router
balances expert contributions by dynamically determining optimal weights based
on input, thereby effectively mitigating knowledge conflicts. To further
improve inference reliability, we design an inference-time enhancement module
to reduce variance and mitigate suboptimal reasoning. Experiments on three
public datasets show that our RouteDK achieves accuracy comparable to or even
better than the teacher LLM, while maintaining strong computational efficiency.
In addition, it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for bundle generation.

Motivation: 监督学习方法在新领域中面临数据注释成本高、资源稀缺的挑战，同时注释偏差导致模型迁移性差。需要一种无需大量标签数据的方法来满足实际应用需求。

Method: 提出新的技术，组合多个思维链代理，利用大语言模型的标记级不确定性评分。实验中使用Llama和Qwen模型的3B和70B+参数版本。

Result: 方法能够满足实际需求，并开启了在标签稀缺条件下如何评估准确性的讨论。

Conclusion: 零样本设置中利用大语言模型对于解决新领域中数据注释资源有限的问题具有重要价值，通过思维链代理组合和不确定性评估的方法可以提高性能。

Abstract: Aspect-category sentiment analysis provides granular insights by identifying
specific themes within product reviews that are associated with particular
opinions. Supervised learning approaches dominate the field. However, data is
scarce and expensive to annotate for new domains. We argue that leveraging
large language models in a zero-shot setting is beneficial where the time and
resources required for dataset annotation are limited. Furthermore, annotation
bias may lead to strong results using supervised methods but transfer poorly to
new domains in contexts that lack annotations and demand reproducibility. In
our work, we propose novel techniques that combine multiple chain-of-thought
agents by leveraging large language models' token-level uncertainty scores. We
experiment with the 3B and 70B+ parameter size variants of Llama and Qwen
models, demonstrating how these approaches can fulfil practical needs and
opening a discussion on how to gauge accuracy in label-scarce conditions.

Abstract: The pursuit of human-level artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly
advanced the development of autonomous agents and Large Language Models (LLMs).
LLMs are now widely utilized as decision-making agents for their ability to
interpret instructions, manage sequential tasks, and adapt through feedback.
This review examines recent developments in employing LLMs as autonomous agents
and tool users and comprises seven research questions. We only used the papers
published between 2023 and 2025 in conferences of the A* and A rank and Q1
journals. A structured analysis of the LLM agents' architectural design
principles, dividing their applications into single-agent and multi-agent
systems, and strategies for integrating external tools is presented. In
addition, the cognitive mechanisms of LLM, including reasoning, planning, and
memory, and the impact of prompting methods and fine-tuning procedures on agent
performance are also investigated. Furthermore, we evaluated current benchmarks
and assessment protocols and have provided an analysis of 68 publicly available
datasets to assess the performance of LLM-based agents in various tasks. In
conducting this review, we have identified critical findings on verifiable
reasoning of LLMs, the capacity for self-improvement, and the personalization
of LLM-based agents. Finally, we have discussed ten future research directions
to overcome these gaps.

Abstract: Interactive online learning environments, represented by Massive AI-empowered
Courses (MAIC), leverage LLM-driven multi-agent systems to transform passive
MOOCs into dynamic, text-based platforms, enhancing interactivity through LLMs.
This paper conducts an empirical study on a specific MAIC course to explore
three research questions about dropouts in these interactive online courses:
(1) What factors might lead to dropouts? (2) Can we predict dropouts? (3) Can
we reduce dropouts? We analyze interaction logs to define dropouts and identify
contributing factors. Our findings reveal strong links between dropout
behaviors and textual interaction patterns. We then propose a
course-progress-adaptive dropout prediction framework (CPADP) to predict
dropouts with at most 95.4% accuracy. Based on this, we design a personalized
email recall agent to re-engage at-risk students. Applied in the deployed MAIC
system with over 3,000 students, the feasibility and effectiveness of our
approach have been validated on students with diverse backgrounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法使用静态生成长度和刚性验证标准，无法适应不同模型不确定性和输入复杂度，限制了方法的适应性和效率

Method: 利用起草模型输出分布的熵和边界不确定性度量，动态调整每轮推测生成的token数量，并使用相同置信度信号调制验证过程，实现更灵活的token接受

Result: 在机器翻译和摘要任务上相比标准推测解码获得显著加速，同时保持或改进了BLEU和ROUGE分数

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个原则性的即插即用解决方案，能够在不同不确定性条件下实现大型语言模型的高效鲁棒解码

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

*Haojie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DropLoRA是一种基于剪枝的参数高效微调方法，通过在LoRA的两个低秩矩阵间插入剪枝模块来模拟动态子空间学习，克服传统LoRA静态子空间的限制，在不增加训练和推理成本的情况下显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的LoRA方法使用低秩分解近似参数更新，但与全参数微调相比存在性能差距。低秩更新往往导致下游任务性能瓶颈，需要一种能够动态适应学习子空间的方法来突破这一限制。

Method: DropLoRA在LoRA的两个低秩矩阵之间引入剪枝模块，专注于对秩维度进行剪枝，模拟动态子空间学习。这种方法允许模型在微调过程中持续调整学习子空间，而不是局限于静态的低秩子空间。

Result: 实验结果表明，DropLoRA在LLaMA系列模型的微调中 consistently优于传统LoRA方法，在常识推理、数学推理、代码生成和指令跟随等多种大语言模型生成任务上都取得了更好的性能。

Conclusion: DropLoRA通过动态低秩子空间学习有效克服了传统LoRA的局限性，在不增加额外计算成本的情况下显著提升了参数高效微调的性能，为大语言模型的微调提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: LoRA-based large model parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods use
low-rank de- composition to approximate updates to model parameters. However,
compared to full- parameter fine-tuning, low-rank updates often lead to a
performance gap in downstream tasks. To address this, we introduce DropLoRA, a
novel pruning-based approach that focuses on pruning the rank dimension. Unlike
conven- tional methods that attempt to overcome the low-rank bottleneck,
DropLoRA innovatively integrates a pruning module between the two low-rank
matrices in LoRA to simulate dy- namic subspace learning. This dynamic low-
rank subspace learning allows DropLoRA to overcome the limitations of
traditional LoRA, which operates within a static subspace. By continuously
adapting the learning subspace, DropLoRA significantly boosts performance
without incurring additional training or infer- ence costs. Our experimental
results demon- strate that DropLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA in
fine-tuning the LLaMA series across a wide range of large language model gener-
ation tasks, including commonsense reason- ing, mathematical reasoning, code
generation, and instruction-following. Our code is avail- able at

TL;DR: 通过构建日本行政法院判决的法律知识图谱，提出法律推理组件并通过推理本体连接事实、法律规范和法律适用，实现了比基线方法更准确的法条检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化法律推理方法存在不能准确识别相关法律上下文、不能准确追踪事实与法律规范关联、可能误表右层次化司法推理结构等问题，影响捕捉法院实践中法律适用的能力。

Method: 使用prompt-based大语言模型提取法律推理组件，对法律条文引用进行规范化处理，通过法律推理本体连接事实、规范和法律适用，构建了648份日本行政法院判决的法律知识图谱。

Result: 系统能够捕捉真实法院判决中的完整法律推理结构，将隐式推理显式化并转换为机器可读形式。经专家注释数据评估，在从事实检索相关法律条文方面超过了大语言模型基线和检索增强方法。

Conclusion: 通过构建法律知识图谱的方法，有效解决了现有自动化法律推理方法的限制，能够更准确地捕捉法院实践中法律适用的完整结构，为法律智能分析提供了可靠的技术支撑。

Abstract: Court judgments reveal how legal rules have been interpreted and applied to
facts, providing a foundation for understanding structured legal reasoning.
However, existing automated approaches for capturing legal reasoning, including
large language models, often fail to identify the relevant legal context, do
not accurately trace how facts relate to legal norms, and may misrepresent the
layered structure of judicial reasoning. These limitations hinder the ability
to capture how courts apply the law to facts in practice. In this paper, we
address these challenges by constructing a legal knowledge graph from 648
Japanese administrative court decisions. Our method extracts components of
legal reasoning using prompt-based large language models, normalizes references
to legal provisions, and links facts, norms, and legal applications through an
ontology of legal inference. The resulting graph captures the full structure of
legal reasoning as it appears in real court decisions, making implicit
reasoning explicit and machine-readable. We evaluate our system using expert
annotated data, and find that it achieves more accurate retrieval of relevant
legal provisions from facts than large language model baselines and
retrieval-augmented methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 阿拉伯语言方言的连续性模型化，提出阿拉伯语言通用性指数(AGS)来补充现有的方言度模型，通过词汇在各地方言中的使用范围来量化词汇的通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的阿拉伯方言度模型(ALDi)将复杂的语言变异简化为单一维度，需要更丰富的方式来形容阿拉伯方言的连续性质。

Method: 提出一个流水线模型，结合词语对齐、语源感知编辑距离和平滑处理，在并行语料库中标注词级AGS。然后训练回归模型来预测上下文中的AGS。

Result: 在多方言测试集上，该方法表现超过了包括最新方言识别系统在内的强基线模型。

Conclusion: AGS提供了一种可扩展、语言学基础坚实的方法来建模词汇通用性，丰富了对阿拉伯方言度的表征。

Abstract: Arabic dialects form a diverse continuum, yet NLP models often treat them as
discrete categories. Recent work addresses this issue by modeling dialectness
as a continuous variable, notably through the Arabic Level of Dialectness
(ALDi). However, ALDi reduces complex variation to a single dimension. We
propose a complementary measure: the Arabic Generality Score (AGS), which
quantifies how widely a word is used across dialects. We introduce a pipeline
that combines word alignment, etymology-aware edit distance, and smoothing to
annotate a parallel corpus with word-level AGS. A regression model is then
trained to predict AGS in context. Our approach outperforms strong baselines,
including state-of-the-art dialect ID systems, on a multi-dialect benchmark.
AGS offers a scalable, linguistically grounded way to model lexical generality,
enriching representations of Arabic dialectness.

TL;DR: 对阿拉伯语大模型ALLaM-34B进行了扩展评估，在多个语言任务上表现出色，特别是在生成和语码转换任务中表现优异，证明了其作为阿拉伯语LLM的技术实力和实际部署准备度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的主要基于英语语料训练的大语言模型在捕捉阿拉伯语的语言和文化细微差别方面存在困难，需要专门针对阿拉伯语优化的模型。

Method: 使用包含现代标准阿拉伯语、五种地区方言、语码转换、事实知识、算术和时间推理、创意生成以及对抗性安全性的提示包，收集115个输出，并用三个前沿LLM法官（GPT-5、Gemini 2.5 Pro、Claude Sonnet-4）进行评分。

Result: ALLaM-34B在生成和语码转换任务上表现优异（平均4.92/5），现代标准阿拉伯语处理能力强（4.74/5），推理能力扎实（4.64/5），方言保真度有所提升（4.21/5），安全相关提示表现稳定可靠（4.54/5）。

Conclusion: ALLaM-34B是一个强大且文化根基深厚的阿拉伯语大语言模型，展现了技术实力和实际部署的准备度，为阿拉伯语NLP应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained primarily on English corpora often
struggle to capture the linguistic and cultural nuances of Arabic. To address
this gap, the Saudi Data and AI Authority (SDAIA) introduced the $ALLaM$ family
of Arabic-focused models. The most capable of these available to the public,
$ALLaM-34B$, was subsequently adopted by HUMAIN, who developed and deployed
HUMAIN Chat, a closed conversational web service built on this model. This
paper presents an expanded and refined UI-level evaluation of $ALLaM-34B$.
Using a prompt pack spanning modern standard Arabic, five regional dialects,
code-switching, factual knowledge, arithmetic and temporal reasoning, creative
generation, and adversarial safety, we collected 115 outputs (23 prompts times
5 runs) and scored each with three frontier LLM judges (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro,
Claude Sonnet-4). We compute category-level means with 95\% confidence
intervals, analyze score distributions, and visualize dialect-wise metric heat
maps. The updated analysis reveals consistently high performance on generation
and code-switching tasks (both averaging 4.92/5), alongside strong results in
MSA handling (4.74/5), solid reasoning ability (4.64/5), and improved dialect
fidelity (4.21/5). Safety-related prompts show stable, reliable performance of
(4.54/5). Taken together, these results position $ALLaM-34B$ as a robust and
culturally grounded Arabic LLM, demonstrating both technical strength and
practical readiness for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 当前LLM代理的评估主要依赖静态基准和小规模人工研究，缺乏自动化、全面的测试方法。

Method: 结合静态代码分析、设计者询问、文献挖掘和基于人设的对抗测试生成，通过LLM作为裁判的反馈来调整测试难度，针对代理的最弱能力进行定向测试。

Result: 在旅行规划器和维基百科写作器上，ATA比专家标注者发现更多样化和严重的故障，测试时间从数天缩短到20-30分钟。

Conclusion: ATA提供了一种高效、自动化的LLM代理测试方法，能够输出量化指标和定性错误报告，代码分析和大搜索对测试质量至关重要。

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly deployed to plan, retrieve, and write with tools,
yet evaluation still leans on static benchmarks and small human studies. We
present the Agent-Testing Agent (ATA), a meta-agent that combines static code
analysis, designer interrogation, literature mining, and persona-driven
adversarial test generation whose difficulty adapts via judge feedback. Each
dialogue is scored with an LLM-as-a-Judge (LAAJ) rubric and used to steer
subsequent tests toward the agent's weakest capabilities. On a travel planner
and a Wikipedia writer, the ATA surfaces more diverse and severe failures than
expert annotators while matching severity, and finishes in 20--30 minutes
versus ten-annotator rounds that took days. Ablating code analysis and web
search increases variance and miscalibration, underscoring the value of
evidence-grounded test generation. The ATA outputs quantitative metrics and
qualitative bug reports for developers. We release the full methodology and
open-source implementation for reproducible agent testing:

Motivation: 现有数据可视化问答基准主要关注静态图表，忽视了仪表板的交互性，这限制了评估现代多模态GUI推理代理的能力

Method: 创建DashboardQA基准，包含来自Tableau Public的112个交互式仪表板和405个问答对，涵盖多选题、事实性、假设性、多仪表板和对话式五类问题

Result: 评估显示所有视觉语言模型在交互式仪表板推理方面都存在显著局限，最佳模型准确率仅38.69%，OpenAI CUA代理仅22.69%

Conclusion: 交互式仪表板推理对所有评估的VLM来说都是极具挑战性的任务，现有代理在仪表板元素定位、交互轨迹规划和推理执行方面存在关键限制

Abstract: Dashboards are powerful visualization tools for data-driven decision-making,
integrating multiple interactive views that allow users to explore, filter, and
navigate data. Unlike static charts, dashboards support rich interactivity,
which is essential for uncovering insights in real-world analytical workflows.
However, existing question-answering benchmarks for data visualizations largely
overlook this interactivity, focusing instead on static charts. This limitation
severely constrains their ability to evaluate the capabilities of modern
multimodal agents designed for GUI-based reasoning. To address this gap, we
introduce DashboardQA, the first benchmark explicitly designed to assess how
vision-language GUI agents comprehend and interact with real-world dashboards.
The benchmark includes 112 interactive dashboards from Tableau Public and 405
question-answer pairs with interactive dashboards spanning five categories:
multiple-choice, factoid, hypothetical, multi-dashboard, and conversational. By
assessing a variety of leading closed- and open-source GUI agents, our analysis
reveals their key limitations, particularly in grounding dashboard elements,
planning interaction trajectories, and performing reasoning. Our findings
indicate that interactive dashboard reasoning is a challenging task overall for
all the VLMs evaluated. Even the top-performing agents struggle; for instance,
the best agent based on Gemini-Pro-2.5 achieves only 38.69% accuracy, while the
OpenAI CUA agent reaches just 22.69%, demonstrating the benchmark's significant
difficulty. We release DashboardQA at https://github.com/vis-nlp/DashboardQA

Motivation: 声明规范化是自动事实核查系统的关键组成部分，需要将嘈杂的社交媒体帖子等数据解析为规范化声明，以供下游真实性分类任务使用。

Method: 采用检索优先、LLM支持的轻量级流水线，动态提示GPT-4o-mini并提供上下文示例，或直接从训练数据集中检索最接近的规范化结果。

Result: 在官方测试集上，该系统在大多数单语赛道中排名靠前，在13种语言中的7种获得第一名，但在零样本设置下表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该方法在单语环境下有效，但在零样本迁移方面存在局限性，需要进一步改进跨语言泛化能力。

Abstract: Claim normalization is an integral part of any automatic fact-check
verification system. It parses the typically noisy claim data, such as social
media posts into normalized claims, which are then fed into downstream veracity
classification tasks. The CheckThat! 2025 Task 2 focuses specifically on claim
normalization and spans 20 languages under monolingual and zero-shot
conditions. Our proposed solution consists of a lightweight
\emph{retrieval-first, LLM-backed} pipeline, in which we either dynamically
prompt a GPT-4o-mini with in-context examples, or retrieve the closest
normalization from the train dataset directly. On the official test set, the
system ranks near the top for most monolingual tracks, achieving first place in
7 out of of the 13 languages. In contrast, the system underperforms in the
zero-shot setting, highlighting the limitation of the proposed solution.

TL;DR: 提出了DuET-PD框架评估LLM在说服性对话中的立场变化动态，发现GPT-4o在误导性说服下准确率仅27.32%，并引入Holistic DPO训练方法显著提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在说服性对话中难以平衡对错误信息的轻信和对有效纠正的抵抗，这是可靠部署的关键挑战。

Method: 引入DuET-PD双评估框架，从说服类型（纠正性/误导性）和领域（知识/安全）两个维度评估多轮立场变化动态；提出Holistic DPO训练方法，平衡正面和负面说服示例。

Result: GPT-4o在持续误导性说服下MMLU-Pro准确率仅27.32%；新开源模型呈现越来越强的奉承趋势；Holistic DPO将Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct在安全上下文误导性说服下的准确率从4.21%提升至76.54%。

Conclusion: 这些贡献为开发更可靠和适应性强的多轮对话LLM提供了途径，Holistic DPO方法能同时增强对错误信息的鲁棒性和对纠正的接受性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can struggle to balance gullibility to
misinformation and resistance to valid corrections in persuasive dialogues, a
critical challenge for reliable deployment. We introduce DuET-PD (Dual
Evaluation for Trust in Persuasive Dialogues), a framework evaluating
multi-turn stance-change dynamics across dual dimensions: persuasion type
(corrective/misleading) and domain (knowledge via MMLU-Pro, and safety via
SALAD-Bench). We find that even a state-of-the-art model like GPT-4o achieves
only 27.32% accuracy in MMLU-Pro under sustained misleading persuasions.
Moreover, results reveal a concerning trend of increasing sycophancy in newer
open-source models. To address this, we introduce Holistic DPO, a training
approach balancing positive and negative persuasion examples. Unlike prompting
or resist-only training, Holistic DPO enhances both robustness to
misinformation and receptiveness to corrections, improving
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct's accuracy under misleading persuasion in safety contexts
from 4.21% to 76.54%. These contributions offer a pathway to developing more
reliable and adaptable LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. Code is available at

TL;DR: 研究分析了动词多词表达式(VMWE)对机器翻译质量的负面影响，并提出了基于大语言模型的重写方法来改善翻译效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动词多词表达式具有复杂和非组合性质，对自然语言处理构成重大挑战，虽然机器翻译模型在近年取得显著进步，但准确翻译这些复杂语言结构仍然是个开放问题

Method: 分析三类VMWE（动词习语、动词-什么结构、轻动词结构）对英语到多语种翻译质量的影响，使用现有多词表达式数据集和从翻译数据集提取的包含这些现象的句子，评估最先进翻译系统的处理能力，并提出基于LLM的重写方法

Result: 实验结果一致显示VMWE对翻译质量产生负面影响，通过LLM基于重写方法将这些表达式替换为字面对应词，在动词习语和动词-什么结构的翻译中实现了显著的质量提升

Conclusion: 动词多词表达式是机器翻译的重要挑战，基于大语言模型的重写策略能够有效改善对这些复杂语言现象的处理能力，为提高翻译质量提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs) present significant challenges for
natural language processing due to their complex and often non-compositional
nature. While machine translation models have seen significant improvement with
the advent of language models in recent years, accurately translating these
complex linguistic structures remains an open problem. In this study, we
analyze the impact of three VMWE categories -- verbal idioms, verb-particle
constructions, and light verb constructions -- on machine translation quality
from English to multiple languages. Using both established multiword expression
datasets and sentences containing these language phenomena extracted from
machine translation datasets, we evaluate how state-of-the-art translation
systems handle these expressions. Our experimental results consistently show
that VMWEs negatively affect translation quality. We also propose an LLM-based
paraphrasing approach that replaces these expressions with their literal
counterparts, demonstrating significant improvement in translation quality for
verbal idioms and verb-particle constructions.

TL;DR: 提出基于句子排名的零样本文档分类方法，通过TF-IDF策略选择信息量最大的句子，在保持分类准确性的同时减少35%推理时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型如BERT擅长短文本分类，但在长文档分类中存在输入长度限制和计算效率低的问题，需要一种不改变模型架构的高效解决方案

Method: 使用TF-IDF句子排名策略选择最信息丰富的句子，减少输入上下文长度，实现零样本文档分类

Result: 在MahaNews数据集上，仅保留前50%排名句子即可保持与完整文档相当的分类性能，同时减少35%推理时间

Conclusion: 句子排名是一种简单有效的技术，可实现可扩展且高效的零样本文档分类

Abstract: Transformer-based models like BERT excel at short text classification but
struggle with long document classification (LDC) due to input length
limitations and computational inefficiencies. In this work, we propose an
efficient, zero-shot approach to LDC that leverages sentence ranking to reduce
input context without altering the model architecture. Our method enables the
adaptation of models trained on short texts, such as headlines, to long-form
documents by selecting the most informative sentences using a TF-IDF-based
ranking strategy. Using the MahaNews dataset of long Marathi news articles, we
evaluate three context reduction strategies that prioritize essential content
while preserving classification accuracy. Our results show that retaining only
the top 50\% ranked sentences maintains performance comparable to full-document
inference while reducing inference time by up to 35\%. This demonstrates that
sentence ranking is a simple yet effective technique for scalable and efficient
zero-shot LDC.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 首个专门用于法语TTS的端到端SSML标签插入流水线，通过两个精细调整的模型控制语调、语速、音量咈停等语调参数，显著提升合成语音的自然度咈表达力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业文本转语音(TTS)系统在语调控制方面存在限制，导致合成语音缺乏表达力。需要一种能够在法语TTS中插入SSML标签来精确控制语调参数的方法。

Method: 采用叠加架构，使用两个QLoRA精细调整的Qwen 2.5-7B模型：一个预测短语间断位置，另一个进行语调目标回归，生成商业TTS兼容的SSML标记。

Result: 在14小时法语搅客语料上，断开位置预测F1分数达99.2%，语调目标的平均绝对误差比仅用提示的大语言模型咈BiLSTM基线减少25-40%。在感知评估中，SSML增强的语音显著提高了自然度，平均意见分数从3.20提升到3.87，18名参与者中15人更喜欢增强合成。

Conclusion: 该方法在缩小合成语音与自然法语语音之间的表达力差距方面取得了重大进展，为商业TTS系统提供了一种高效的语调控制解决方案。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, synthetic voices often lack expressiveness due to
limited prosody control in commercial text-to-speech (TTS) systems. We
introduce the first end-to-end pipeline that inserts Speech Synthesis Markup
Language (SSML) tags into French text to control pitch, speaking rate, volume,
and pause duration. We employ a cascaded architecture with two QLoRA-fine-tuned
Qwen 2.5-7B models: one predicts phrase-break positions and the other performs
regression on prosodic targets, generating commercial TTS-compatible SSML
markup. Evaluated on a 14-hour French podcast corpus, our method achieves 99.2%
F1 for break placement and reduces mean absolute error on pitch, rate, and
volume by 25-40% compared with prompting-only large language models (LLMs) and
a BiLSTM baseline. In perceptual evaluation involving 18 participants across
over 9 hours of synthesized audio, SSML-enhanced speech generated by our
pipeline significantly improves naturalness, with the mean opinion score
increasing from 3.20 to 3.87 (p < 0.005). Additionally, 15 of 18 listeners
preferred our enhanced synthesis. These results demonstrate substantial
progress in bridging the expressiveness gap between synthetic and natural
French speech. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文研究发现多智能体辩论(MAD)的性能提升主要来自多数投票机制，而非辩论过程本身。通过理论分析和实验验证，表明单纯的辩论并不能提高期望正确性，而简单的集成方法在实际应用中更可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体辩论(MAD)作为提升大语言模型性能的新范式，但其有效性的关键因素尚不明确。研究者希望解构MAD，分析多数投票和智能体间辩论各自的实际贡献。

Method: 将MAD解构为多数投票和智能体间辩论两个关键组件，通过7个NLP基准测试进行广泛实验，并提出将辩论建模为随机过程的理论框架，证明辩论过程形成鞅过程。

Result: 实验表明多数投票单独贡献了MAD的大部分性能提升。理论分析证明辩论过程不会改善期望正确性。通过偏向修正的信念更新干预可以提升辩论效果。

Conclusion: 虽然MAD有潜力，但在许多实际场景中，简单的集成方法仍然是更强大和可靠的选择。辩论过程需要有针对性的干预才能发挥有效作用。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Debate~(MAD) has emerged as a promising paradigm for improving
the performance of large language models through collaborative reasoning.
Despite recent advances, the key factors driving MAD's effectiveness remain
unclear. In this work, we disentangle MAD into two key components--Majority
Voting and inter-agent Debate--and assess their respective contributions.
Through extensive experiments across seven NLP benchmarks, we find that
Majority Voting alone accounts for most of the performance gains typically
attributed to MAD. To explain this, we propose a theoretical framework that
models debate as a stochastic process. We prove that it induces a martingale
over agents' belief trajectories, implying that debate alone does not improve
expected correctness. Guided by these insights, we demonstrate that targeted
interventions, by biasing the belief update toward correction, can meaningfully
enhance debate effectiveness. Overall, our findings suggest that while MAD has
potential, simple ensembling methods remain strong and more reliable
alternatives in many practical settings. Code is released in

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出将LLM的拟人化视为设计概念而非风险，建立了包含感知、语言、行为和认知四个维度的分类体系，为实践者提供可操作的设计杠杆和功能导向的评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前关于LLM拟人化的研究主要关注风险（如过度信任和用户欺骗），缺乏设计指导。作者认为拟人化应被视为可有意调节以支持用户目标的设计概念。

Method: 从多学科角度提出LLM拟人化应反映设计者与解释者之间的互动，通过设计者嵌入的线索和解释者的认知响应来实现。将线索分为感知、语言、行为和认知四个维度进行分析。

Result: 建立了统一的分类体系，为实践者提供了可操作的设计杠杆，并分析了每种线索的表现形式和有效性。

Conclusion: 倡导功能导向的拟人化设计评估，强调拟人化应作为支持用户目标的主动设计选择，而非单纯的风险因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit \textbf{anthropomorphism}
characteristics -- human-like qualities portrayed across their outlook,
language, behavior, and reasoning functions. Such characteristics enable more
intuitive and engaging human-AI interactions. However, current research on
anthropomorphism remains predominantly risk-focused, emphasizing over-trust and
user deception while offering limited design guidance. We argue that
anthropomorphism should instead be treated as a \emph{concept of design} that
can be intentionally tuned to support user goals. Drawing from multiple
disciplines, we propose that the anthropomorphism of an LLM-based artifact
should reflect the interaction between artifact designers and interpreters.
This interaction is facilitated by cues embedded in the artifact by the
designers and the (cognitive) responses of the interpreters to the cues. Cues
are categorized into four dimensions: \textit{perceptive, linguistic,
behavioral}, and \textit{cognitive}. By analyzing the manifestation and
effectiveness of each cue, we provide a unified taxonomy with actionable levers
for practitioners. Consequently, we advocate for function-oriented evaluations
of anthropomorphic design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现代NLP模型性能优异，但其决策过程仍是黑盒。因果NLP领域旨在结合因果推断理论与NLP模型来阐明文本特征的因果效应，提高模型可解释性。

Method: 开发基于RieszNet的双头神经网络架构，通过正则化文本分类器来遵循估计的因果效应，使用半合成的IMDB电影评论数据进行训练和验证。

Result: 在IMDB影评数据上，CausalSent框架将治疗效果估计的MAE比Bansal等人的方法降低了2-3倍。通过验证模型的集成，发现"love"一词的存在会导致正面情感概率增加2.9%。

Conclusion: CausalSent框架有效提升了文本因果效应估计的准确性，为理解NLP模型的决策机制提供了重要工具，证明了特定词汇对情感分类的因果影响。

Abstract: Despite the overwhelming performance improvements offered by recent natural
language procesing (NLP) models, the decisions made by these models are largely
a black box. Towards closing this gap, the field of causal NLP combines causal
inference literature with modern NLP models to elucidate causal effects of text
features. We replicate and extend Bansal et al's work on regularizing text
classifiers to adhere to estimated effects, focusing instead on model
interpretability. Specifically, we focus on developing a two-headed
RieszNet-based neural network architecture which achieves better treatment
effect estimation accuracy. Our framework, CausalSent, accurately predicts
treatment effects in semi-synthetic IMDB movie reviews, reducing MAE of effect
estimates by 2-3x compared to Bansal et al's MAE on synthetic Civil Comments
data. With an ensemble of validated models, we perform an observational case
study on the causal effect of the word "love" in IMDB movie reviews, finding
that the presence of the word "love" causes a +2.9% increase in the probability
of a positive sentiment.

Method: 构建包含500个Stack Exchange未解决问题的数据集，结合规则过滤、LLM判断和人工审核确保问题质量；使用复合验证策略利用生成器-验证器差距提供评估信号；建立开放平台让专家集体验证问题和解决方案

Result: 顶级模型仅通过15%问题的UQ验证，初步人工验证已在通过验证的答案中识别出正确答案

Conclusion: UQ为评估前沿模型在真实世界开放性挑战中的表现开辟了新路径，成功解决这些问题将推动人类知识前沿

Abstract: Benchmarks shape progress in AI research. A useful benchmark should be both
difficult and realistic: questions should challenge frontier models while also
reflecting real-world usage. Yet, current paradigms face a difficulty-realism
tension: exam-style benchmarks are often made artificially difficult with
limited real-world value, while benchmarks based on real user interaction often
skew toward easy, high-frequency problems. In this work, we explore a radically
different paradigm: assessing models on unsolved questions. Rather than a
static benchmark scored once, we curate unsolved questions and evaluate models
asynchronously over time with validator-assisted screening and community
verification. We introduce UQ, a testbed of 500 challenging, diverse questions
sourced from Stack Exchange, spanning topics from CS theory and math to sci-fi
and history, probing capabilities including reasoning, factuality, and
browsing. UQ is difficult and realistic by construction: unsolved questions are
often hard and naturally arise when humans seek answers, thus solving them
yields direct real-world value. Our contributions are threefold: (1) UQ-Dataset
and its collection pipeline combining rule-based filters, LLM judges, and human
review to ensure question quality (e.g., well-defined and difficult); (2)
UQ-Validators, compound validation strategies that leverage the
generator-validator gap to provide evaluation signals and pre-screen candidate
solutions for human review; and (3) UQ-Platform, an open platform where experts
collectively verify questions and solutions. The top model passes UQ-validation
on only 15% of questions, and preliminary human verification has already
identified correct answers among those that passed. UQ charts a path for
evaluating frontier models on real-world, open-ended challenges, where success
pushes the frontier of human knowledge. We release UQ at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索模型剪枝对LLM意见摘要公平性的影响，特别是在可能影响公众观点的偏见输出方面，这是之前未被研究的重要问题。

Method: 使用三种最先进的剪枝方法和多种校准集，在三个开源LLM上进行系统分析，提出了基于高梯度低激活的HGLA剪枝方法，识别并移除对输入处理冗余但对输出生成有影响的参数。

Result: 剪枝方法对公平性的影响比校准集更大；HGLA方法相比现有方法能更好地保持甚至提升公平性，在传统方法有局限的模型和任务中表现优异；人工评估显示HGLA生成的输出更公平。

Conclusion: HGLA剪枝方法在保持模型压缩优势的同时，有效解决了剪枝可能带来的公平性问题，为LLM的公平性优化提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Model compression through post-training pruning offers a way to reduce model
size and computational requirements without significantly impacting model
performance. However, the effect of pruning on the fairness of LLM-generated
summaries remains unexplored, particularly for opinion summarisation where
biased outputs could influence public views.In this paper, we present a
comprehensive empirical analysis of opinion summarisation, examining three
state-of-the-art pruning methods and various calibration sets across three
open-source LLMs using four fairness metrics. Our systematic analysis reveals
that pruning methods have a greater impact on fairness than calibration sets.
Building on these insights, we propose High Gradient Low Activation (HGLA)
pruning, which identifies and removes parameters that are redundant for input
processing but influential in output generation. Our experiments demonstrate
that HGLA can better maintain or even improve fairness compared to existing
methods, showing promise across models and tasks where traditional methods have
limitations. Our human evaluation shows HGLA-generated outputs are fairer than
existing state-of-the-art pruning methods. Code is available at:

Motivation: 现有激活引导方法要么对所有生成内容进行无差别干预，要么仅依赖问题来决定干预，无法准确评估干预强度，且检测到偏离后干预往往为时已晚

Method: FASB框架动态跟踪LLM生成过程中的内部状态，同时考虑问题和已生成内容来决定干预的必要性和强度；引入回溯机制纠正已偏离的token

Result: 在TruthfulQA数据集和六个多项选择题数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于基线方法

Conclusion: FASB框架通过动态状态跟踪和回溯机制，有效解决了现有激活引导方法的局限性，实现了更精准和及时的干预

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across many
generation tasks. Nevertheless, effectively aligning them with desired
behaviors remains a significant challenge. Activation steering is an effective
and cost-efficient approach that directly modifies the activations of LLMs
during the inference stage, aligning their responses with the desired behaviors
and avoiding the high cost of fine-tuning. Existing methods typically
indiscriminately intervene to all generations or rely solely on the question to
determine intervention, which limits the accurate assessment of the
intervention strength. To this end, we propose the Flexible Activation Steering
with Backtracking (FASB) framework, which dynamically determines both the
necessity and strength of intervention by tracking the internal states of the
LLMs during generation, considering both the question and the generated
content. Since intervening after detecting a deviation from the desired
behavior is often too late, we further propose the backtracking mechanism to
correct the deviated tokens and steer the LLMs toward the desired behavior.
Extensive experiments on the TruthfulQA dataset and six multiple-choice
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines. Our code will be
released at https://github.com/gjw185/FASB.

Abstract: Speech emotions play a crucial role in human-computer interaction, shaping
engagement and context-aware communication. Despite recent advances in spoken
dialogue systems, a holistic system for evaluating emotional reasoning is still
lacking. To address this, we introduce EMO-Reasoning, a benchmark for assessing
emotional coherence in dialogue systems. It leverages a curated dataset
generated via text-to-speech to simulate diverse emotional states, overcoming
the scarcity of emotional speech data. We further propose the Cross-turn
Emotion Reasoning Score to assess the emotion transitions in multi-turn
dialogues. Evaluating seven dialogue systems through continuous, categorical,
and perceptual metrics, we show that our framework effectively detects
emotional inconsistencies, providing insights for improving current dialogue
systems. By releasing a systematic evaluation benchmark, we aim to advance
emotion-aware spoken dialogue modeling toward more natural and adaptive
interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理任务中存在过度思考问题，这会导致性能下降和资源浪费。研究发现LLMs通常在补偿推理阶段产生正确答案，而推理收敛阶段容易触发过度思考。

Method: 通过分析思考长度和内容长度的模式，将推理分为三个阶段，挖掘敏感的RCP模式，并开发基于启发式规则的轻量级阈值策略来精确检测推理完成点。

Result: 在AIME24、AIME25、GPQA-D等基准测试上的实验表明，该方法能够显著减少token消耗，同时保持或提升推理准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的RCP检测方法有效解决了LLMs过度思考问题，实现了计算效率与推理性能的良好平衡，为大语言模型的推理优化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enhance complex reasoning tasks by scaling the
individual thinking process. However, prior work shows that overthinking can
degrade overall performance. Motivated by observed patterns in thinking length
and content length, we categorize reasoning into three stages: insufficient
exploration stage, compensatory reasoning stage, and reasoning convergence
stage. Typically, LLMs produce correct answers in the compensatory reasoning
stage, whereas reasoning convergence often triggers overthinking, causing
increased resource usage or even infinite loops. Therefore, mitigating
overthinking hinges on detecting the end of the compensatory reasoning stage,
defined as the Reasoning Completion Point (RCP). RCP typically appears at the
end of the first complete reasoning cycle and can be identified by querying the
LLM sentence by sentence or monitoring the probability of an end-of-thinking
token (e.g., \texttt{</think>}), though these methods lack an efficient and
precise balance. To improve this, we mine more sensitive and consistent RCP
patterns and develop a lightweight thresholding strategy based on heuristic
rules. Experimental evaluations on benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA-D)
demonstrate that the proposed method reduces token consumption while preserving
or enhancing reasoning accuracy.

Motivation: DPO在大型语言模型对齐中存在奖励黑客问题，导致生成内容过长缺乏多样性，以及灾难性遗忘知识

Method: 提出Weights-Rotated Preference Optimization (RoPO)算法，隐式约束输出层logits，显式约束中间隐藏状态通过多粒度正交矩阵微调

Result: 在AlpacaEval 2上提升3.27分，MT-Bench上超越最佳基线6.2-7.5分，仅使用0.015%可训练参数

Conclusion: RoPO有效缓解DPO的奖励黑客问题，保持预训练和SFT阶段获得的知识和表达能力

Abstract: Despite the efficacy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs), reward hacking remains a pivotal challenge. This
issue emerges when LLMs excessively reduce the probability of rejected
completions to achieve high rewards, without genuinely meeting their intended
goals. As a result, this leads to overly lengthy generation lacking diversity,
as well as catastrophic forgetting of knowledge. We investigate the underlying
reason behind this issue, which is representation redundancy caused by neuron
collapse in the parameter space. Hence, we propose a novel Weights-Rotated
Preference Optimization (RoPO) algorithm, which implicitly constrains the
output layer logits with the KL divergence inherited from DPO and explicitly
constrains the intermediate hidden states by fine-tuning on a multi-granularity
orthogonal matrix. This design prevents the policy model from deviating too far
from the reference model, thereby retaining the knowledge and expressive
capabilities acquired during pre-training and SFT stages. Our RoPO achieves up
to a 3.27-point improvement on AlpacaEval 2, and surpasses the best baseline by
6.2 to 7.5 points on MT-Bench with merely 0.015% of the trainable parameters,
demonstrating its effectiveness in alleviating the reward hacking problem of
DPO.

Result: 实验和人工评估显示半自动流水线能达到部分竞争力，但全自动综述生成仍存在引用质量低和批判性分析有限的问题

Conclusion: 虽然半自动方法表现良好，但全自动文献综述生成在质量和深度方面仍需改进，需要更好的质量评估和选择机制

Abstract: Automatic survey generation has emerged as a key task in scientific document
processing. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating
survey texts, the lack of standardized evaluation datasets critically hampers
rigorous assessment of their performance against human-written surveys. In this
work, we present SurveyGen, a large-scale dataset comprising over 4,200
human-written surveys across diverse scientific domains, along with 242,143
cited references and extensive quality-related metadata for both the surveys
and the cited papers. Leveraging this resource, we build QUAL-SG, a novel
quality-aware framework for survey generation that enhances the standard
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline by incorporating quality-aware
indicators into literature retrieval to assess and select higher-quality source
papers. Using this dataset and framework, we systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art LLMs under varying levels of human involvement - from fully
automatic generation to human-guided writing. Experimental results and human
evaluations show that while semi-automatic pipelines can achieve partially
competitive outcomes, fully automatic survey generation still suffers from low
citation quality and limited critical analysis.

*Anant Khandelwal,Manish Gupta,Puneet Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoCoA是一种新颖的自适应解码算法，通过置信度感知度量和参数化与上下文分布之间的广义散度来解决知识冲突，在保持低冲突场景性能的同时显著提升问答准确性和事实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在参数记忆与外部上下文之间存在知识冲突时，现有对比解码方法缺乏适应性且在低冲突场景下性能下降，需要一种更有效的冲突解决方法来提高生成忠实度。

Method: CoCoA算法利用熵差和上下文峰值度等置信度感知度量，以及参数化分布与上下文分布之间的广义散度，在token级别进行自适应的冲突解决。

Result: 在多个问答、摘要和长问答基准测试中，CoCoA相比强基线AdaCAD平均提升9.2个百分点的问答准确性，在摘要和长问答中平均提升2.5个百分点的事实性，并展现出对冲突变化的优异敏感性。

Conclusion: CoCoA能够实现更知情、上下文感知且最终更忠实的token生成，为大型语言模型的知识冲突问题提供了有效的自适应解决方案。

Abstract: Faithful generation in large language models (LLMs) is challenged by
knowledge conflicts between parametric memory and external context. Existing
contrastive decoding methods tuned specifically to handle conflict often lack
adaptability and can degrade performance in low conflict settings. We introduce
CoCoA (Confidence- and Context-Aware Adaptive Decoding), a novel token-level
algorithm for principled conflict resolution and enhanced faithfulness. CoCoA
resolves conflict by utilizing confidence-aware measures (entropy gap and
contextual peakedness) and the generalized divergence between the parametric
and contextual distributions. Crucially, CoCoA maintains strong performance
even in low conflict settings. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs on
diverse Question Answering (QA), Summarization, and Long-Form Question
Answering (LFQA) benchmarks demonstrate CoCoA's state-of-the-art performance
over strong baselines like AdaCAD. It yields significant gains in QA accuracy,
up to 9.2 points on average compared to the strong baseline AdaCAD, and
improves factuality in summarization and LFQA by up to 2.5 points on average
across key benchmarks. Additionally, it demonstrates superior sensitivity to
conflict variations. CoCoA enables more informed, context-aware, and ultimately
more faithful token generation.

TL;DR: 提出了TextTopoOOD框架和TNT-OOD方法，用于解决文本丰富网络中的OOD检测问题，通过融合文本和拓扑结构特征来提升检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要处理标签偏移或简单域分割，忽略了文本-结构多样性的复杂性，特别是在社交网络等文本丰富网络中，OOD可能源于不同的语言模式

Method: 1) TextTopoOOD评估框架包含四种OOD场景；2) TNT-OOD方法使用交叉注意力模块融合局部结构到文本表示，以及HyperNetwork生成节点特定变换参数

Result: 在11个数据集和四种OOD场景上的实验验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: TextTopoOOD框架揭示了文本丰富网络中OOD检测的细微挑战，TNT-OOD方法通过融合文本和拓扑特征有效提升了检测性能

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains challenging in text-rich
networks, where textual features intertwine with topological structures.
Existing methods primarily address label shifts or rudimentary domain-based
splits, overlooking the intricate textual-structural diversity. For example, in
social networks, where users represent nodes with textual features (name, bio)
while edges indicate friendship status, OOD may stem from the distinct language
patterns between bot and normal users. To address this gap, we introduce the
TextTopoOOD framework for evaluating detection across diverse OOD scenarios:
(1) attribute-level shifts via text augmentations and embedding perturbations;
(2) structural shifts through edge rewiring and semantic connections; (3)
thematically-guided label shifts; and (4) domain-based divisions. Furthermore,
we propose TNT-OOD to model the complex interplay between Text aNd Topology
using: 1) a novel cross-attention module to fuse local structure into
node-level text representations, and 2) a HyperNetwork to generate
node-specific transformation parameters. This aligns topological and semantic
features of ID nodes, enhancing ID/OOD distinction across structural and
textual shifts. Experiments on 11 datasets across four OOD scenarios
demonstrate the nuanced challenge of TextTopoOOD for evaluating OOD detection
in text-rich networks.

*Wataru Ikeda,Kazuki Yano,Ryosuke Takahashi,Jaesung Lee,Keigo Shibata,Jun Suzuki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了Transformer语言模型中前向网络(FFN)在不同层次的重要性，通过在保持总参数数量不变的情况下重新分配FFN层，发现将FFN集中在连续的70%中间层可以提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer模型在所有层都配置前向网络，但并不清楚不同层次的FFN对预训练的贡献度如何。本研究想要探索FFN在不同层位置的重要性差异，而非使用现有预训练模型进行分析。

Method: 采用了一种实验方法：在保持总参数数量不变的前提下，增大某些层的FFN维度，同时完全移除其他层的FFN。从头开始训练不同规模(285M、570M、1.2B参数)和不同层数(12、24、40层)的模型。

Result: 结果显示，将FFN集中在连续的70%中间层的配置方案，在多个下游任务上都正常地超过了标准的均匀分布配置。这种效果在不同模型规模和层数下都保持一致性。

Conclusion: 这项研究表明Transformer模型中前向网络的层次分布对模型性能有重要影响，适当地重新分配FFN资源（将其集中在中间层）可以在不增加总参数的情况下提升模型表现。这为Transformer架构的效率优化提供了新的视角。

Abstract: This study investigates the layerwise importance of feed-forward networks
(FFNs) in Transformer-based language models during pretraining. We introduce an
experimental approach that, while maintaining the total parameter count,
increases the FFN dimensions in some layers and completely removes the FFNs
from other layers. Furthermore, since our focus is on the importance of FFNs
during pretraining, we train models from scratch to examine whether the
importance of FFNs varies depending on their layer positions, rather than using
publicly available pretrained models as is frequently done. Through
comprehensive evaluations of models with varying sizes (285M, 570M, and 1.2B
parameters) and layer counts (12, 24, and 40 layers), we demonstrate that
concentrating FFNs in 70% of the consecutive middle layers consistently
outperforms standard configurations for multiple downstream tasks.

Method: 提出动态验证集概念（随测试集同步演化）和SMITE迭代算法，通过选择最优上下文示例集来验证每个示例集的效果。

Result: 在四种不同的大语言模型上进行实验，结果显示该方法在预测准确性和公平性方面都显著超过基准方法。

Conclusion: 这是首次将动态验证应用于大语言模型上下文学习的研究，为提高LLM性能和公平性提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for downstream tasks such as
tabular classification, where ensuring fairness in their outputs is critical
for inclusivity, equal representation, and responsible AI deployment. This
study introduces a novel approach to enhancing LLM performance and fairness
through the concept of a dynamic validation set, which evolves alongside the
test set, replacing the traditional static validation approach. We also propose
an iterative algorithm, SMITE, to select optimal in-context examples, with each
example set validated against its corresponding dynamic validation set. The
in-context set with the lowest total error is used as the final demonstration
set. Our experiments across four different LLMs show that our proposed
techniques significantly improve both predictive accuracy and fairness compared
to baseline methods. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply dynamic
validation in the context of in-context learning for LLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过分析LLM内部状态来主动检测版权数据泄露风险的方法，在文本生成前进行干预以防止敏感信息暴露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在训练过程中可能无意中暴露受版权保护或专有数据，传统方法只能在内容生成后处理泄露问题，存在敏感信息暴露风险。

Method: 使用精选的版权材料数据集训练神经网络分类器，通过分析LLM内部状态在文本生成前检测潜在泄露风险，并与检索增强生成(RAG)系统集成实现早期干预。

Result: 实验结果表明，分析内部状态能有效降低版权数据泄露风险，提供可扩展的解决方案，在保持高质量文本生成的同时确保符合版权法规。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM提供了一种主动的版权保护机制，能够无缝集成到AI工作流中，增强数据隐私和伦理标准，同时满足版权和许可要求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) but pose risks of inadvertently exposing copyrighted or proprietary data,
especially when such data is used for training but not intended for
distribution. Traditional methods address these leaks only after content is
generated, which can lead to the exposure of sensitive information. This study
introduces a proactive approach: examining LLMs' internal states before text
generation to detect potential leaks. By using a curated dataset of copyrighted
materials, we trained a neural network classifier to identify risks, allowing
for early intervention by stopping the generation process or altering outputs
to prevent disclosure. Integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
system, this framework ensures adherence to copyright and licensing
requirements while enhancing data privacy and ethical standards. Our results
show that analyzing internal states effectively mitigates the risk of
copyrighted data leakage, offering a scalable solution that fits smoothly into
AI workflows, ensuring compliance with copyright regulations while maintaining
high-quality text generation. The implementation is available on
GitHub.\footnote{https://github.com/changhu73/Internal_states_leakage}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现GPT词汇表中许多中文词汇表示色情或赌博内容，需要系统研究这些污染词汇的存在及其与训练数据的关系

Method: 1) 基于GPT词汇表定义污染词汇分类 2) 微调LLM构建污染词汇检测器 3) 通过词汇出现频率推测训练数据污染程度

Result: GPT词汇表表现最差，超过23%的长中文词汇是色情或赌博内容；推测GPT-4o训练数据中约0.5%是"Yui Hatano"相关网页

Conclusion: LLM词汇表中广泛存在污染词汇，GPT问题最严重，训练数据污染程度可通过词汇出现频率进行推测

Abstract: Tokens are basic elements in the datasets for LLM training. It is well-known
that many tokens representing Chinese phrases in the vocabulary of GPT
(4o/4o-mini/o1/o3/4.5/4.1/o4-mini) are indicating contents like pornography or
online gambling. Based on this observation, our goal is to locate Polluted
Chinese (PoC) tokens in LLMs and study the relationship between PoC tokens'
existence and training data. (1) We give a formal definition and taxonomy of
PoC tokens based on the GPT's vocabulary. (2) We build a PoC token detector via
fine-tuning an LLM to label PoC tokens in vocabularies by considering each
token's both semantics and related contents from the search engines. (3) We
study the speculation on the training data pollution via PoC tokens'
appearances (token ID). Experiments on GPT and other 23 LLMs indicate that
tokens widely exist while GPT's vocabulary behaves the worst: more than 23%
long Chinese tokens (i.e., a token with more than two Chinese characters) are
either porn or online gambling. We validate the accuracy of our speculation
method on famous pre-training datasets like C4 and Pile. Then, considering
GPT-4o, we speculate that the ratio of "Yui Hatano" related webpages in
GPT-4o's training data is around 0.5%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于合成语音的多发音上下文偏置方法，在预训练的Whisper模型上实现零样本上下文ASR，通过TTS合成多样发音样本，提取多种发音变体构建前缀树，在beam搜索中通过浅融合进行奖励，显著降低了偏置词错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决上下文ASR系统中识别词汇外单词（如命名实体或罕见词）的挑战，这些挑战主要来自训练数据有限以及发音模糊或不一致的问题。

Method: 利用TTS系统合成包含目标罕见词的多样化语音样本，使用预训练Whisper模型提取多种预测发音变体，将这些变体词元序列编译成前缀树，在beam搜索解码过程中以浅融合方式对假设进行奖励，最后将识别的变体映射回原始罕见词。

Result: 在Librispeech数据集上的评估显示，该方法在test-clean上降低了42%的偏置词错误率，在test-other上降低了43%，同时保持无偏置词错误率基本不变。

Conclusion: 提出的合成驱动的多发音上下文偏置方法有效解决了罕见词识别问题，显著提升了上下文ASR系统的性能，同时保持了整体识别准确率。

Abstract: Contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems allow for recognizing
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, such as named entities or rare words. However,
it remains challenging due to limited training data and ambiguous or
inconsistent pronunciations. In this paper, we propose a synthesis-driven
multi-pronunciation contextual biasing method that performs zero-shot
contextual ASR on a pretrained Whisper model. Specifically, we leverage
text-to-speech (TTS) systems to synthesize diverse speech samples containing
each target rare word, and then use the pretrained Whisper model to extract
multiple predicted pronunciation variants. These variant token sequences are
compiled into a prefix-trie, which assigns rewards to beam hypotheses in a
shallow-fusion manner during beam-search decoding. After which, any recognized
variant is mapped back to the original rare word in the final transcription.
The evaluation results on the Librispeech dataset show that our method reduces
biased word error rate (WER) by 42% on test-clean and 43% on test-other while
maintaining unbiased WER essentially unchanged.

Motivation: 解决推理大语言模型(RLLMs)在处理简单问题时过度思考、产生不必要冗长推理链的问题，导致计算效率低下和token消耗过多

Method: 提出动态推理配额分配(DRQA)方法，利用批量生成的偏好数据和强化学习训练模型自适应分配推理资源，鼓励模型生成既准确又简洁的响应

Result: 在广泛的数学和科学推理基准测试中，DRQA显著减少了token使用量，同时保持甚至提高了答案准确性

Conclusion: DRQA有效缓解了过度思考问题，为RLLMs更高效和可扩展的部署提供了有前景的方向，并启发了对推理行为细粒度控制的进一步探索

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O3 and DeepSeek-R1,
have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities by performing structured and
multi-step reasoning. However, recent studies reveal that RLLMs often suffer
from overthinking, i.e., producing unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains even
for simple questions, leading to excessive token consumption and computational
inefficiency. Interestingly, we observe that when processing multiple questions
in batch mode, RLLMs exhibit more resource-efficient behavior by dynamically
compressing reasoning steps for easier problems, due to implicit resource
competition. Inspired by this, we propose Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation
(DRQA), a novel method that transfers the benefits of resource competition from
batch processing to single-question inference. Specifically, DRQA leverages
batch-generated preference data and reinforcement learning to train the model
to allocate reasoning resources adaptively. By encouraging the model to
internalize a preference for responses that are both accurate and concise, DRQA
enables it to generate concise answers for simple questions while retaining
sufficient reasoning depth for more challenging ones. Extensive experiments on
a wide range of mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that DRQA significantly reduces token usage while maintaining, and in many
cases improving, answer accuracy. By effectively mitigating the overthinking
problem, DRQA offers a promising direction for more efficient and scalable
deployment of RLLMs, and we hope it inspires further exploration into
fine-grained control of reasoning behaviors.

Conclusion: 研究结果为推进语音大语言模型中的口语理解提供了有价值的见解，表明连续特征在性能上具有优势，但不同方法各有特点。

Abstract: With the rise of Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs), two dominant
approaches have emerged for speech processing: discrete tokens and continuous
features. Each approach has demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-related
processing tasks. However, the performance gap between these two paradigms has
not been thoroughly explored. To address this gap, we present a fair comparison
of self-supervised learning (SSL)-based discrete and continuous features under
the same experimental settings. We evaluate their performance across six spoken
language understanding-related tasks using both small and large-scale LLMs
(Qwen1.5-0.5B and Llama3.1-8B). We further conduct in-depth analyses, including
efficient comparison, SSL layer analysis, LLM layer analysis, and robustness
comparison. Our findings reveal that continuous features generally outperform
discrete tokens in various tasks. Each speech processing method exhibits
distinct characteristics and patterns in how it learns and processes speech
information. We hope our results will provide valuable insights to advance
spoken language understanding in SpeechLLMs.

TL;DR: ILRe是一种新颖的上下文压缩管道，通过中间层检索和流式分块预填充，将长上下文处理的计算复杂度从O(L²)降低到O(L)，在保持语义完整性的同时显著提升处理速度。


<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型在长上下文场景中存在有效上下文长度短、二次计算复杂度和高内存开销等限制，需要一种高效的上下文压缩方法来解决这些问题。

Result: ILRe能够处理100万token的请求，在华为昇腾910B NPU上处理时间少于30秒（加速比约180倍），在RULER-1M基准测试中获得79.8分，性能达到或超过完整上下文处理。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练或算子开发，就能显著降低长上下文处理的计算复杂度和内存需求，为大规模语言模型的长上下文应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated success across many
benchmarks. However, they still exhibit limitations in long-context scenarios,
primarily due to their short effective context length, quadratic computational
complexity, and high memory overhead when processing lengthy inputs. To
mitigate these issues, we introduce a novel context compression pipeline,
called Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe), which determines one intermediate
decoder layer offline, encodes context by streaming chunked prefill only up to
that layer, and recalls tokens by the attention scores between the input query
and full key cache in that specified layer. In particular, we propose a
multi-pooling kernels allocating strategy in the token recalling process to
maintain the completeness of semantics. Our approach not only reduces the
prefilling complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$, but also achieves performance
comparable to or better than the full context in the long context scenarios.
Without additional post training or operator development, ILRe can process a
single $1M$ tokens request in less than half a minute (speedup $\approx
180\times$) and scores RULER-$1M$ benchmark of $\approx 79.8$ with model
Llama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on a Huawei Ascend 910B NPU.

Abstract: Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language
questions by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and knowledge
graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods rely on task-specific strategies
or bespoke representations, which hinder their ability to dismantle barriers
between different SKR tasks, thereby constraining their overall performance in
cross-task scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{Pandora}, a novel
USKR framework that addresses the limitations of existing methods by leveraging
two key innovations. First, we propose a code-based unified knowledge
representation using \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API, which aligns
seamlessly with the pre-training of LLMs. This representation facilitates a
cohesive approach to handling different structured knowledge sources. Building
on this foundation, we employ knowledge transfer to bolster the unified
reasoning process of LLMs by automatically building cross-task memory. By
adaptively correcting reasoning using feedback from code execution,
\textsc{Pandora} showcases impressive unified reasoning capabilities. Extensive
experiments on six widely used benchmarks across three SKR tasks demonstrate
that \textsc{Pandora} outperforms existing unified reasoning frameworks and
competes effectively with task-specific methods.

Motivation: 识别Wav2Vec中CNN提取的特征是否包含有效的语音信息，特别是针对单元音的前后位置识别

Method: 使用TIMIT语料库，比较三种特征提取方法：基础MFCC、MFCC加形态颜、CNN激活值，通过训练SVM分类器进行前后元音识别

Result: 通过分类准确率评估各种特征提取方法的表现，分析CNN提取的特征是否超过传统方法

Conclusion: 识别了CNN在Wav2Vec中提取的语音特征的有效性，为自监督学习在语音表征方面的价值提供了实验支撑

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition has advanced with self-supervised learning,
enabling feature extraction directly from raw audio. In Wav2Vec, a CNN first
transforms audio into feature vectors before the transformer processes them.
This study examines CNN-extracted information for monophthong vowels using the
TIMIT corpus. We compare MFCCs, MFCCs with formants, and CNN activations by
training SVM classifiers for front-back vowel identification, assessing their
classification accuracy to evaluate phonetic representation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了互联网上多语言信息获取的需求和技术挑战，重点关注非英语用户的语言障碍问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网起源于英语国家，导致英语在网络上占据主导地位，但全球只有20-25%的人口以英语为母语，大量非英语用户因语言障碍无法充分访问网络信息

Method: 通过分析互联网用户增长数据和语言分布统计，研究多语言信息获取的技术约束和现有解决方案

Result: 发现尽管互联网用户数量从1995年的1600万增长到2010年的16.5亿，但语言障碍仍然是阻碍全球信息获取的主要问题，现有解决方案仍存在巨大差距

Conclusion: 需要进一步开发和完善多语言技术解决方案，以消除互联网上的语言障碍，实现真正的全球信息平等获取

Abstract: The usage of Internet has grown exponentially over the last two decades. The
number of Internet users has grown from 16 Million to 1650 Million from 1995 to
2010. It has become a major repository of information catering almost every
area. Since the Internet has its origin in USA which is English speaking
country there is huge dominance of English on the World Wide Web. Although
English is a globally acceptable language, still there is a huge population in
the world which is not able to access the Internet due to language constraints.
It has been estimated that only 20-25% of the world population speaks English
as a native language. More and more people are accessing the Internet nowadays
removing the cultural and linguistic barriers and hence there is a high growth
in the number of non-English speaking users over the last few years on the
Internet. Although many solutions have been provided to remove the linguistic
barriers, still there is a huge gap to be filled. This paper attempts to
analyze the need of information availability in different languages and the
various technological constraints related to multi-linguism on the Internet.

*Promise Dodzi Kpoglu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督的借词检测方法，仅使用语言内部信息在单语和多语词汇表中识别借词，通过提取语言特征、概率映射和迭代优化，在6种印欧语系语言上超越基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统借词检测方法依赖语言外部信息，可能引入循环性和限制性，需要一种仅基于语言内部信息的无监督方法来改进历史语言学工作流程。

Method: 混合方法：提取相关语言特征，进行评分和概率映射，通过识别和泛化新兴模式迭代优化初始结果，结合语言学和统计线索指导发现过程。

Result: 在英语、德语、法语、意大利语、西班牙语和葡萄牙语六种印欧语系语言数据集上评估，模型表现优于基线方法，跨语言数据扩展时性能提升显著。

Conclusion: 该方法成功证明了仅使用语言内部信息的无监督借词检测的可行性，为历史语言学提供了更有效的工作流程，特别是在多语言环境下表现优异。

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for detecting loanwords i.e., words
borrowed from one language into another. While prior work has primarily relied
on language-external information to identify loanwords, such approaches can
introduce circularity and constraints into the historical linguistics workflow.
In contrast, our model relies solely on language-internal information to
process both native and borrowed words in monolingual and multilingual
wordlists. By extracting pertinent linguistic features, scoring them, and
mapping them probabilistically, we iteratively refine initial results by
identifying and generalizing from emerging patterns until convergence. This
hybrid approach leverages both linguistic and statistical cues to guide the
discovery process. We evaluate our method on the task of isolating loanwords in
datasets from six standard Indo-European languages: English, German, French,
Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model outperforms baseline methods, with strong performance gains observed when
scaling to cross-linguistic data.

TL;DR: 本文研究如何利用单个大语言模型执行多个论点挖掘任务，通过多任务数据集构建和不同训练策略对比，证明了多任务训练和模型合并的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论点挖掘领域需要自动提取论证结构，但现有研究多主要集中在单任务上。本文想探索如何用单一大语言模型处理多个相关任务，以提高效率和性能。

Method: 首先构建了统一格式的多任务数据集（包含19个公开数据集），然后使用Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct模型进行三种训练策略：单任务精调、多任务聚合训练、单任务模型合并。

Result: 单任务精调在所有任务上都显著提升了性能；多任务训练保持了强劲性能且没有性能泄漏；模型合并方法在避免高计算成本的同时具有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过多任务训练和模型合并策略，可以在单一大语言模型个有效地执行多个论点挖掘任务，为论点挖掘领域提供了高效的多任务处理方案。

Abstract: Argument mining is a subfield of argumentation that aims to automatically
extract argumentative structures and their relations from natural language
texts. This paper investigates how a single large language model can be
leveraged to perform one or several argument mining tasks. Our contributions
are two-fold. First, we construct a multi-task dataset by surveying and
converting 19 well-known argument mining datasets from the literature into a
unified format. Second, we explore various training strategies using Meta AI's
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model: (1) fine-tuning on individual tasks, (2)
fine-tuning jointly on multiple tasks, and (3) merging models fine-tuned
separately on individual tasks. Our experiments show that task-specific
fine-tuning significantly improves individual performance across all tasks.
Moreover, multi-task fine-tuning maintains strong performance without
degradation, suggesting effective transfer learning across related tasks.
Finally, we demonstrate that model merging offers a viable compromise: it
yields competitive performance while mitigating the computational costs
associated with full multi-task fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出在联合潜在空间而非直接在LLM表示上进行去偏，使用基于平行语料训练的自动编码器构建跨语言对齐空间，显著提升了去偏效果和跨语言迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏方法（如SentDebias）直接应用于LLM表示时跨语言迁移效果有限，需要寻找更有效的跨语言去偏方案。

Method: 使用平行TED演讲脚本训练自动编码器构建对齐的跨语言潜在空间，在该空间而非原始LLM表示上应用去偏技术。

Result: 在Aya-expanse模型和四种语言上的实验表明：自动编码器能有效构建对齐的跨语言潜在空间，且在该空间去偏能显著提升去偏性能和跨语言迁移性。

Conclusion: 在联合潜在空间进行去偏比直接在LLM表示上操作更有效，为跨语言去偏提供了新思路。

Abstract: Debiasing techniques such as SentDebias aim to reduce bias in large language
models (LLMs). Previous studies have evaluated their cross-lingual
transferability by directly applying these methods to LLM representations,
revealing their limited effectiveness across languages. In this work, we
therefore propose to perform debiasing in a joint latent space rather than
directly on LLM representations. We construct a well-aligned cross-lingual
latent space using an autoencoder trained on parallel TED talk scripts. Our
experiments with Aya-expanse and two debiasing techniques across four languages
(English, French, German, Dutch) demonstrate that a) autoencoders effectively
construct a well-aligned cross-lingual latent space, and b) applying debiasing
techniques in the learned cross-lingual latent space significantly improves
both the overall debiasing performance and cross-lingual transferability.

Motivation: 研究LLMs如何将子词序列组合成有意义的词级表示，理解不同模型在子词信息组合方面的内在机制和差异。

Method: 设计全面的实验集，从结构相似性、语义可分解性和形式特征保持三个维度，分层分析五种LLM家族的子词组合模式。

Result: 发现LLMs可分为三类不同的组合策略组：(1)结构相似性在不同层呈现三种演化模式；(2)在语义可分解性探测中表现出优异性能；(3)在形式特征敏感性方面也呈现三种不同模式。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs的组合动态特性，突显了不同模型在编码和整合子词信息时的不同组合模式，为理解LLMs内部工作机制提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) take sequences of subwords as input, requiring
them to effective compose subword representations into meaningful word-level
representations. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of experiments
to probe how LLMs compose subword information, focusing on three key aspects:
structural similarity, semantic decomposability, and form retention. Our
analysis of the experiments suggests that these five LLM families can be
classified into three distinct groups, likely reflecting difference in their
underlying composition strategies. Specifically, we observe (i) three distinct
patterns in the evolution of structural similarity between subword compositions
and whole-word representations across layers; (ii) great performance when
probing layer by layer their sensitivity to semantic decompositionality; and
(iii) three distinct patterns when probing sensitivity to formal features,
e.g., character sequence length. These findings provide valuable insights into
the compositional dynamics of LLMs and highlight different compositional
pattens in how LLMs encode and integrate subword information.

TL;DR: 本文质疑大语言模型作为评估者(LLJs)的可靠性，认为当前对其的热情可能为时过早，需要更严格的验证和负责任的使用实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在自然语言生成评估中的广泛应用，其有效性和可靠性尚未得到充分验证，需要基于测量理论进行批判性分析。

Method: 基于社会科学中的测量理论，分析LLJs作为评估工具的四个核心假设：人类判断代理能力、评估能力、可扩展性和成本效益，并通过对文本摘要、数据标注和安全对齐三个应用场景的考察来验证这些假设。

Result: 发现LLJs在作为评估者时存在固有局限性，当前实践可能无法充分验证其可靠性，需要更严格的验证程序。

Conclusion: 呼吁在LLJs评估中采用更负责任的实践方法，确保其在自然语言生成领域的应用能够真正支持而非阻碍该领域的发展。

Abstract: Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems remains a core challenge
of natural language processing (NLP), further complicated by the rise of large
language models (LLMs) that aims to be general-purpose. Recently, large
language models as judges (LLJs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
traditional metrics, but their validity remains underexplored. This position
paper argues that the current enthusiasm around LLJs may be premature, as their
adoption has outpaced rigorous scrutiny of their reliability and validity as
evaluators. Drawing on measurement theory from the social sciences, we identify
and critically assess four core assumptions underlying the use of LLJs: their
ability to act as proxies for human judgment, their capabilities as evaluators,
their scalability, and their cost-effectiveness. We examine how each of these
assumptions may be challenged by the inherent limitations of LLMs, LLJs, or
current practices in NLG evaluation. To ground our analysis, we explore three
applications of LLJs: text summarization, data annotation, and safety
alignment. Finally, we highlight the need for more responsible evaluation
practices in LLJs evaluation, to ensure that their growing role in the field
supports, rather than undermines, progress in NLG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估量化技术对模型偏见的影响，特别关注对不同人口统计亚组的影响，为实际应用中平衡效率与伦理考量提供指导。

Method: 使用权重和激活量化策略，在九个基准测试中采用概率性和生成文本指标，评估不同架构家族和推理能力的模型。

Result: 量化对偏见有细微影响：降低毒性，不影响情感，但轻微增加刻板印象和生成任务不公平性，趋势在不同人口统计类别和模型类型中一致。

Conclusion: 量化实践中需要仔细平衡效率与伦理考虑，量化对偏见的影响取决于具体设置，需谨慎应用。

Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of how quantization affects
model bias, with particular attention to its impact on individual demographic
subgroups. We focus on weight and activation quantization strategies and
examine their effects across a broad range of bias types, including
stereotypes, toxicity, sentiment, and fairness. We employ both probabilistic
and generated text-based metrics across nine benchmarks and evaluate models
varying in architecture family and reasoning ability. Our findings show that
quantization has a nuanced impact on bias: while it can reduce model toxicity
and does not significantly impact sentiment, it tends to slightly increase
stereotypes and unfairness in generative tasks, especially under aggressive
compression. These trends are generally consistent across demographic
categories and model types, although their magnitude depends on the specific
setting. Overall, our results highlight the importance of carefully balancing
efficiency and ethical considerations when applying quantization in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症与神经退行性疾病如多发硫硫症常同时存在，但语音基于AI在这类情况下检测抑郁的潜力仍未得到探索。

Method: 采用监督机器学习模型，包括：1通用语音语言特征；2语音情感识别模型提取的情感维度；3探索性语音特征分析。进行跨语料库和跨语言分析。

Result: 模型在多发硫硫症患者中检测抑郁情绪达到66% UAR，经特征选择后提升至74%。情感变化在抑郁检测中发挥重要作用。

Conclusion: 该研究为语音基于抑郁检测在神经退行性疾病等共存病状下的普遍化提供了初步探索，证明了其可行性。

Abstract: Depression commonly co-occurs with neurodegenerative disorders like Multiple
Sclerosis (MS), yet the potential of speech-based Artificial Intelligence for
detecting depression in such contexts remains unexplored. This study examines
the transferability of speech-based depression detection methods to people with
MS (pwMS) through cross-corpus and cross-lingual analysis using English data
from the general population and German data from pwMS. Our approach implements
supervised machine learning models using: 1) conventional speech and language
features commonly used in the field, 2) emotional dimensions derived from a
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model, and 3) exploratory speech feature
analysis. Despite limited data, our models detect depressive mood in pwMS with
moderate generalisability, achieving a 66% Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) on a
binary task. Feature selection further improved performance, boosting UAR to
74%. Our findings also highlight the relevant role emotional changes have as an
indicator of depressive mood in both the general population and within PwMS.
This study provides an initial exploration into generalising speech-based
depression detection, even in the presence of co-occurring conditions, such as
neurodegenerative diseases.

Motivation: 评估长上下文窗口LLM在专业工业领域的技术QA表现，模拟跨语言信息检索场景，测试模型的实际应用能力和幻觉问题。

Method: 使用英法德三种语言的农业机器手册构建测试集，包含可回答和不可回答问题。比较9款长上下文LLM的直接提示与三种RAG策略（关键词、语义、混合），采用LLM作为评判者进行评估。

Result: 混合RAG在所有语言上都明显优于直接提示。Gemini 2.5 Flash和Qwen 2.5 7B模型通过RAG方式在所有语言上都达到了85%以上的高准确率。

Conclusion: 在专业工业领域的技术QA任务中，RAG方案比单纯依靠长上下文窗口的直接提示更有效，小型模型通过RAG也能获得优异表现。该研究提供了一个可重用的评估框架。

Abstract: We present a case study evaluating large language models (LLMs) with
128K-token context windows on a technical question answering (QA) task. Our
benchmark is built on a user manual for an agricultural machine, available in
English, French, and German. It simulates a cross-lingual information retrieval
scenario where questions are posed in English against all three language
versions of the manual. The evaluation focuses on realistic
"needle-in-a-haystack" challenges and includes unanswerable questions to test
for hallucinations. We compare nine long-context LLMs using direct prompting
against three Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies (keyword,
semantic, hybrid), with an LLM-as-a-judge for evaluation. Our findings for this
specific manual show that Hybrid RAG consistently outperforms direct
long-context prompting. Models like Gemini 2.5 Flash and the smaller Qwen 2.5
7B achieve high accuracy (over 85%) across all languages with RAG. This paper
contributes a detailed analysis of LLM performance in a specialized industrial
domain and an open framework for similar evaluations, highlighting practical
trade-offs and challenges.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了检测LLM规划行为的因果标准和方法，发现在不同模型和任务中，规划行为并非普遍存在，而是存在模型和任务间的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设固定的规划视野，且多关注单一提示或狭窄领域，需要更系统的方法来区分LLM的规划与即兴生成行为。

Method: 提出了形式化和因果基础的规划检测标准，并开发了半自动标注流程，应用于Gemma-2-2B模型在MBPP代码生成和诗歌生成任务上的分析。

Result: 发现规划行为不是普遍的：Gemma-2-2B在诗歌生成任务中采用即兴方式，在MBPP任务中在相似任务甚至连续token预测间切换规划与即兴行为。指令微调会精炼而非从头创建规划行为。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM规划机制的机制研究提供了可复现和可扩展的基础，揭示了规划行为的模型和任务特异性。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across a wide range of multi-step reasoning tasks. Recent work suggests that
LLMs may perform planning - selecting a future target token in advance and
generating intermediate tokens that lead towards it - rather than merely
improvising one token at a time. However, existing studies assume fixed
planning horizons and often focus on single prompts or narrow domains. To
distinguish planning from improvisation across models and tasks, we present
formal and causally grounded criteria for detecting planning and operationalize
them as a semi-automated annotation pipeline. We apply this pipeline to both
base and instruction-tuned Gemma-2-2B models on the MBPP code generation
benchmark and a poem generation task where Claude 3.5 Haiku was previously
shown to plan. Our findings show that planning is not universal: unlike Haiku,
Gemma-2-2B solves the same poem generation task through improvisation, and on
MBPP it switches between planning and improvisation across similar tasks and
even successive token predictions. We further show that instruction tuning
refines existing planning behaviors in the base model rather than creating them
from scratch. Together, these studies provide a reproducible and scalable
foundation for mechanistic studies of planning in LLMs.

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of multimodal content on social media,
sentiment analysis faces significant challenges in effectively processing
heterogeneous data and recognizing multi-label emotions. Existing methods often
lack effective cross-modal fusion and external knowledge integration. We
propose SentiMM, a novel multi-agent framework designed to systematically
address these challenges. SentiMM processes text and visual inputs through
specialized agents, fuses multimodal features, enriches context via knowledge
retrieval, and aggregates results for final sentiment classification. We also
introduce SentiMMD, a large-scale multimodal dataset with seven fine-grained
sentiment categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SentiMM achieves
superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, validating the
effectiveness of our structured approach.

Method: 提出了一个结构化框架，详细规定了实现高质量本地化所需的各个阶段和程序，确保不损害文化真实性。

Result: 成功应用该框架完成了10,000个同义词集的本地化工作，并报告了相关成果。

Conclusion: 该研究为普林斯顿WordNet的阿拉伯语本地化提供了一个系统性的高质量框架，解决了现有工作中规模和文化对齐方面的不足。

Abstract: As Princeton WordNet continues to gain significance as a semantic lexicon in
Natural Language Processing, the need for its localization and for ensuring the
quality of this process has become increasingly critical. Existing efforts
remain limited in both scale and rigor, and there is a notable absence of
studies addressing the accuracy of localization or its alignment with the
cultural context of Arabic. This paper proposes a structured framework for the
localization of Princeton WordNet, detailing the stages and procedures required
to achieve high-quality results without compromising cultural authenticity. We
further present our experience in applying this framework, reporting outcomes
from the localization of 10,000 synsets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: S²Sent提出了一种句子表示选择机制，通过空间选择和嵌套频率选择来优化Transformer编码器中不同块的表示融合，在保持低冗余和低语义损失的同时显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer编码器和对比学习的主流句子表示学习方法通常只使用最后一层的隐藏状态，但不同Transformer块具有不同的语义感知能力，需要合理的跨块表示融合来优化性能。

Method: 提出S²Sent机制，在Transformer编码器下游集成参数化嵌套选择器，包括空间选择(SS)和嵌套频率选择(FS)。SS采用基于空间压缩的自门控机制获得自适应权重，FS使用不同DCT基函数替代GAP实现低语义损失的空间压缩。

Result: 大量实验表明，S²Sent在基线方法基础上取得了显著改进，仅增加可忽略的额外参数和推理延迟，同时具有高集成性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: S²Sent通过创新的跨块表示融合机制有效平衡了语义冗余和损失，为句子表示学习提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: The combination of Transformer-based encoders with contrastive learning
represents the current mainstream paradigm for sentence representation
learning. This paradigm is typically based on the hidden states of the last
Transformer block of the encoder. However, within Transformer-based encoders,
different blocks exhibit varying degrees of semantic perception ability. From
the perspective of interpretability, the semantic perception potential of
knowledge neurons is modulated by stimuli, thus rational cross-block
representation fusion is a direction worth optimizing. To balance the semantic
redundancy and loss across block fusion, we propose a sentence representation
selection mechanism S\textsuperscript{2}Sent, which integrates a parameterized
nested selector downstream of the Transformer-based encoder. This selector
performs spatial selection (SS) and nested frequency selection (FS) from a
modular perspective. The SS innovatively employs a spatial squeeze based
self-gating mechanism to obtain adaptive weights, which not only achieves
fusion with low information redundancy but also captures the dependencies
between embedding features. The nested FS replaces GAP with different DCT basis
functions to achieve spatial squeeze with low semantic loss. Extensive
experiments have demonstrated that S\textsuperscript{2}Sent achieves
significant improvements over baseline methods with negligible additional
parameters and inference latency, while highlighting high integrability and
scalability.

*Deep Anil Patel,Iain Melvin,Christopher Malon,Martin Renqiang Min*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DiscussLLM框架，通过训练LLM主动决定何时发言而不仅仅是说什么，来弥补现有模型在对话中的被动性局限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型主要作为被动响应代理，只在被提示时才回应，这种被动性造成了"意识差距"，限制了它们作为动态人类讨论中真正协作伙伴的潜力

Method: 开发了可扩展的两阶段数据生成管道，合成大规模的多轮人类讨论数据集，标注五种干预类型；训练模型预测特殊静默标记来学习何时保持沉默；探索了端到端模型和解耦的分类器-生成器系统两种架构

Result: 模型学会了在不需要干预时保持沉默，直到能够做出有益贡献时才发言

Conclusion: 该框架为构建更具情境意识和主动性的对话AI铺平了道路，使LLM能够更自然地参与动态人类讨论

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
understanding and generating human-like text, yet they largely operate as
reactive agents, responding only when directly prompted. This passivity creates
an "awareness gap," limiting their potential as truly collaborative partners in
dynamic human discussions. We introduce $\textit{DiscussLLM}$, a framework
designed to bridge this gap by training models to proactively decide not just
$\textit{what}$ to say, but critically, $\textit{when}$ to speak. Our primary
contribution is a scalable two-stage data generation pipeline that synthesizes
a large-scale dataset of realistic multi-turn human discussions. Each
discussion is annotated with one of five intervention types (e.g., Factual
Correction, Concept Definition) and contains an explicit conversational trigger
where an AI intervention adds value. By training models to predict a special
silent token when no intervention is needed, they learn to remain quiet until a
helpful contribution can be made. We explore two architectural baselines: an
integrated end-to-end model and a decoupled classifier-generator system
optimized for low-latency inference. We evaluate these models on their ability
to accurately time interventions and generate helpful responses, paving the way
for more situationally aware and proactive conversational AI.

TL;DR: 提出了JSA-RAG方法，通过联合随机近似算法解决RAG模型端到端训练中的离散隐变量边缘化问题，显著优于传统RAG和VRAG方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG模型端到端优化面临离散隐变量边缘化的挑战，传统top-K边缘化和VRAG方法存在梯度估计偏差或高方差问题

Method: 提出基于联合随机近似(JSA)算法的端到端RAG训练方法JSA-RAG，JSA是EM算法的随机扩展，特别适用于离散隐变量模型估计

Result: 在5个数据集上的开放域问答和知识对话任务中，JSA-RAG显著优于传统RAG和VRAG方法

Conclusion: JSA-RAG在生成、检索和低方差梯度估计方面表现出色，为RAG模型的端到端优化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely recognized paradigm
to combine parametric memory with non-parametric memories. An RAG model
consists of two serial connecting components (retriever and generator). A major
challenge in end-to-end optimization of the RAG model is that marginalization
over relevant passages (modeled as discrete latent variables) from a knowledge
base is required. Traditional top-K marginalization and variational RAG (VRAG)
suffer from biased or high-variance gradient estimates. In this paper, we
propose and develop joint stochastic approximation (JSA) based end-to-end
training of RAG, which is referred to as JSA-RAG. The JSA algorithm is a
stochastic extension of the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm and is
particularly powerful in estimating discrete latent variable models. Extensive
experiments are conducted on five datasets for two tasks (open-domain question
answering, knowledge-grounded dialogs) and show that JSA-RAG significantly
outperforms both vanilla RAG and VRAG. Further analysis shows the efficacy of
JSA-RAG from the perspectives of generation, retrieval, and low-variance
gradient estimate.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AulSign是一种利用大语言模型进行手语翻译的新方法，通过动态提示和上下文学习解决数据稀缺问题，在低数据场景下优于现有最先进模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言到手语的翻译任务复杂且缺乏研究，主要受限于平行语料库的稀缺性。现有方法在数据稀缺环境中泛化能力差，且可用数据集通常领域特定、缺乏标准化或无法完全捕捉手语的语言丰富性

Method: 提出AulSign方法，利用大语言模型通过动态提示和上下文学习，结合样本选择和后续手语关联。将手语与自然语言的紧凑描述关联，并指导模型使用这些描述

Result: 在英语和意大利语上使用SignBank+和LaCAM CNR-ISTC数据集进行评估，在低数据场景下表现出优于最先进模型的性能

Conclusion: AulSign方法有效，有潜力提升通信技术对代表性不足语言群体的可访问性和包容性

Abstract: Translating natural languages into sign languages is a highly complex and
underexplored task. Despite growing interest in accessibility and inclusivity,
the development of robust translation systems remains hindered by the limited
availability of parallel corpora which align natural language with sign
language data. Existing methods often struggle to generalize in these
data-scarce environments, as the few datasets available are typically
domain-specific, lack standardization, or fail to capture the full linguistic
richness of sign languages. To address this limitation, we propose Advanced Use
of LLMs for Sign Language Translation (AulSign), a novel method that leverages
Large Language Models via dynamic prompting and in-context learning with sample
selection and subsequent sign association. Despite their impressive abilities
in processing text, LLMs lack intrinsic knowledge of sign languages; therefore,
they are unable to natively perform this kind of translation. To overcome this
limitation, we associate the signs with compact descriptions in natural
language and instruct the model to use them. We evaluate our method on both
English and Italian languages using SignBank+, a recognized benchmark in the
field, as well as the Italian LaCAM CNR-ISTC dataset. We demonstrate superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art models in low-data scenario. Our
findings demonstrate the effectiveness of AulSign, with the potential to
enhance accessibility and inclusivity in communication technologies for
underrepresented linguistic communities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过语言分析识别个人音乐偏好，基于大五人格特质建立了高精度模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音乐反映个人身份特征，之前研究已证实音乐偏好与人格相关，而人格又能通过语言分析检测，因此探索是否能通过语言预测音乐偏好

Method: 使用500,000个文本样本和近5,000名作者的数据集，基于大五人格特质建立高级模型进行分析

Result: 发现不同音乐流派的粉丝在人格特征上存在显著差异

Conclusion: 证实了通过语言分析可以识别个人音乐偏好，为计算语言学、音乐心理学和人格分析的交叉研究提供了资源

Abstract: Music serves as a powerful reflection of individual identity, often aligning
with deeper psychological traits. Prior research has established correlations
between musical preferences and personality traits, while separate studies have
demonstrated that personality is detectable through linguistic analysis. Our
study bridges these two research domains by investigating whether individuals'
musical preferences are recognizable in their spontaneous language through the
lens of the Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness,
Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism). Using a carefully curated
dataset of over 500,000 text samples from nearly 5,000 authors with reliably
identified musical preferences, we build advanced models to assess personality
characteristics. Our results reveal significant personality differences across
fans of five musical genres. We release resources for future research at the
intersection of computational linguistics, music psychology and personality
analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于联络中心领域的合成对话生成方法，利用现有通话属性作为监督信号，并引入包含18个指标的诊断框架来评估生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联络中心对话具有目标导向、角色不对称和行为复杂的特点，且面临隐私和数据稀缺问题，需要开发专门的合成对话生成方法来支持模型训练和评估。

Method: 利用意图摘要、话题流程和QA评估表等现有通话属性作为监督信号，提出了四种语言无关的生成策略，从简单提示到特征感知的多阶段方法，并建立了包含18个语言和行为指标的诊断框架。

Result: 结果显示所有方法都存在挑战，没有一种方法在所有特征上都表现优异，特别是在不流畅性、情感和行为真实性方面存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: 提出的诊断工具能够暴露合成对话的差距，支持跨语言的细粒度评估和压力测试，为联络中心领域的合成对话生成提供了有效的评估手段。

Abstract: Synthetic transcript generation is critical in contact center domains, where
privacy and data scarcity limit model training and evaluation. Unlike prior
synthetic dialogue generation work on open-domain or medical dialogues, contact
center conversations are goal-oriented, role-asymmetric, and behaviorally
complex, featuring disfluencies, ASR noise, and compliance-driven agent
actions. In deployments where transcripts are unavailable, standard pipelines
still yield derived call attributes such as Intent Summaries, Topic Flow, and
QA Evaluation Forms. We leverage these as supervision signals to guide
generation. To assess the quality of such outputs, we introduce a diagnostic
framework of 18 linguistically and behaviorally grounded metrics for comparing
real and synthetic transcripts. We benchmark four language-agnostic generation
strategies, from simple prompting to characteristic-aware multi-stage
approaches, alongside reference-free baselines. Results reveal persistent
challenges: no method excels across all traits, with notable deficits in
disfluency, sentiment, and behavioral realism. Our diagnostic tool exposes
these gaps, enabling fine-grained evaluation and stress testing of synthetic
dialogue across languages.

*Meiling Ning,Zhongbao Zhang,Junda Ye,Jiabao Guo,Qingyuan Guan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出ESFP-RM奖励模型框架，通过将AI反馈强化学习中的奖励建模重新定义为自然语言推理任务，利用带上下文解释的掩码语言模型在NLI任务上的优势，构建了更稳定和可泛化的奖励信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于生成模型的奖励建模虽然使AI反馈强化学习(RLAIF)变得高效和可扩展，但需要进一步提升奖励模型的质量。作者发现奖励建模与自然语言推理(NLI)在形式上有根本一致性，这为构建更好的奖励模型指明了方向。

Method: 提出ESFP-RM两阶段奖励模型：首先通过探索性实验证明带上下文解释的掩码语言模型(MLMs)在NLI任务上优于主流自回归模型；然后基于此构建解释性槽位预测框架，充分利用MLMs的优势。

Result: 大量实验表明，在人类反馈强化学习(RLHF)和分布外(OOD)场景中，ESFP-RM框架相比生成式奖励模型能够提供更稳定和可泛化的奖励信号。

Conclusion: 通过将奖励建模重新定义为NLI任务并利用MLMs的优势，ESFP-RM框架显著提升了奖励模型的质量，为AI反馈强化学习提供了更可靠的奖励信号。

Abstract: The emergence of LM-based judging reward modeling, represented by generative
reward models, has successfully made reinforcement learning from AI feedback
(RLAIF) efficient and scalable. To further advance this paradigm, we propose a
core insight: this form of reward modeling shares fundamental formal
consistency with natural language inference (NLI), a core task in natural
language understanding. This reframed perspective points to a key path for
building superior reward models: scaling the model's comprehension boundaries.
Pursuing this path, exploratory experiments on NLI tasks demonstrate that the
slot prediction masked language models (MLMs) incorporating contextual
explanations achieve significantly better performance compared to mainstream
autoregressive models. Based on this key finding, we propose ESFP-RM, a
two-stage LM-based judging reward model that utilizes an explanation based slot
framework for prediction to fully leverage the advantages of MLMs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that in both reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF) and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, the ESFP-RM framework delivers
more stable and generalizable reward signals compared to generative reward
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MTalk-Bench多轮语音对话评测基准，包含语义、副语言和环境声音三个维度，采用竞技场式和评分表式双评测方法，发现当前语音大模型在副语言和环境声音处理方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音到语音大模型的评测框架不足以评估复杂多轮对话的性能，需要更全面的评测标准。

Method: 构建MTalk-Bench多轮语音对话基准，覆盖语义信息、副语言信息和环境声音三个核心维度，每个维度包含9个现实场景，采用竞技场式（成对比较）和评分表式（绝对评分）双评测方法。

Result: 语音大模型在语义信息处理表现优秀，但在副语言信息和环境声音感知方面表现不佳；模型通过增加响应长度来恢复连贯性，但牺牲了多轮对话效率；模态感知的任务特定设计优于简单扩展规模。

Conclusion: 当前语音到语音评测存在局限性，需要更鲁棒、语音感知的评测框架，LLM作为评判者与人类评判在差距明显或标准明确时一致，但存在位置和长度偏差。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech-to-speech (S2S) large language models (LLMs)
has significantly improved real-time spoken interaction. However, current
evaluation frameworks remain inadequate for assessing performance in complex,
multi-turn dialogues. To address this, we introduce MTalk-Bench, a multi-turn
S2S benchmark covering three core dimensions: Semantic Information,
Paralinguistic Information, and Ambient Sound. Each dimension includes nine
realistic scenarios, along with targeted tasks to assess specific capabilities
such as reasoning. Our dual-method evaluation framework combines Arena-style
evaluation (pairwise comparison) and Rubrics-based evaluation (absolute
scoring) for relative and absolute assessment. The benchmark includes both
model and human outputs, evaluated by human evaluators and LLMs. Experimental
results reveal two sets of findings. Overall performance of S2S LLMs: (1)
models excel at semantic information processing yet underperform on
paralinguistic information and ambient sounds perception; (2) models typically
regain coherence by increasing response length, sacrificing efficiency in
multi-turn dialogues; (3) modality-aware, task-specific designs outperform
brute scaling. Evaluation framework and reliability: (1) Arena and Rubrics
yield consistent, complementary rankings, but reliable distinctions emerge only
when performance gaps are large; (2) LLM-as-a-judge aligns with humans when
gaps are clear or criteria explicit, but exhibits position and length biases
and is reliable on nonverbal evaluation only with text annotations. These
results highlight current limitations in S2S evaluation and the need for more
robust, speech-aware assessment frameworks.

*Judith Tavarez-Rodríguez,Fernando Sánchez-Vega,A. Pastor López-Monroy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探索大型语言模型在社交媒体文本中检测性别歧视的能力，发现虽然模型能在一定程度上检测性别歧视，但无法准确复制不同人口群体感知的多样性，存在人口统计偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型已被证明可用于自动检测性别歧视，但这些模型存在偏见，尤其对少数群体的反映不准确。尽管已有各种改进检测性别歧视内容的努力，但由于任务的主观性和自动化模型中的偏见，这仍然是一个重大挑战。

Method: 使用EXIST 2024推文数据集，评估不同LLMs检测社交媒体文本中性别歧视的能力。数据集包含每条推文的六个不同人口统计特征的标注，分析模型是否能模仿这些群体的感知，并进行统计分析以确定哪些人口特征（年龄、性别）对此任务最有效。

Result: 结果显示，虽然LLMs在考虑总体人群意见时能在一定程度上检测性别歧视，但它们无法准确复制不同人口群体感知的多样性。统计分析揭示了模型中存在的人口统计偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调了需要开发更好校准的模型，这些模型应考虑到不同人群视角的多样性，以更准确地检测性别歧视内容。

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven to be a tool that could
help in the automatic detection of sexism. Previous studies have shown that
these models contain biases that do not accurately reflect reality, especially
for minority groups. Despite various efforts to improve the detection of sexist
content, this task remains a significant challenge due to its subjective nature
and the biases present in automated models. We explore the capabilities of
different LLMs to detect sexism in social media text using the EXIST 2024 tweet
dataset. It includes annotations from six distinct profiles for each tweet,
allowing us to evaluate to what extent LLMs can mimic these groups' perceptions
in sexism detection. Additionally, we analyze the demographic biases present in
the models and conduct a statistical analysis to identify which demographic
characteristics (age, gender) contribute most effectively to this task. Our
results show that, while LLMs can to some extent detect sexism when considering
the overall opinion of populations, they do not accurately replicate the
diversity of perceptions among different demographic groups. This highlights
the need for better-calibrated models that account for the diversity of
perspectives across different populations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了大语言模型对中文量词的知识掌握程度，发现LLMs表现不如BERT模型，即使经过微调也难以超越双向注意力机制的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文量词是汉语的重要特征，其正确预测对教育应用至关重要，但主流大语言模型是否具备正确的中文量词知识尚未在NLP文献中得到充分探索。

Method: 采用多种掩码策略评估LLMs的内在能力、不同句子元素的贡献以及注意力机制在预测过程中的作用，同时探索通过微调提升量词预测性能。

Result: 研究发现LLMs表现不如BERT，即使经过微调。预测结果高度依赖后续名词信息，这也解释了具有双向注意力机制的模型（如BERT）的优势。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在中文量词预测任务上表现不及BERT等双向模型，名词信息对量词预测至关重要，双向注意力机制在此类任务中具有明显优势。

Abstract: Classifiers are an important and defining feature of the Chinese language,
and their correct prediction is key to numerous educational applications. Yet,
whether the most popular Large Language Models (LLMs) possess proper knowledge
the Chinese classifiers is an issue that has largely remain unexplored in the
Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature.
  To address such a question, we employ various masking strategies to evaluate
the LLMs' intrinsic ability, the contribution of different sentence elements,
and the working of the attention mechanisms during prediction. Besides, we
explore fine-tuning for LLMs to enhance the classifier performance.
  Our findings reveal that LLMs perform worse than BERT, even with fine-tuning.
The prediction, as expected, greatly benefits from the information about the
following noun, which also explains the advantage of models with a
bidirectional attention mechanism such as BERT.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MIRAGE是一个基于知识图谱的多链推理框架，通过并行推理链和交叉验证解决医疗问答中的错误累积问题，在多个基准测试中优于GPT-4o和其他基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成方法在医疗问答中存在单链推理导致的错误累积问题，且缺乏结构化的知识表示，无法满足医疗领域对准确性和可追溯性的高要求。

Method: 提出MIRAGE框架：1)将复杂查询分解为实体基础子问题；2)执行并行推理链；3)通过邻居扩展和多跳遍历自适应检索证据；4)使用交叉链验证整合答案解决矛盾。

Result: 在三个医疗QA基准测试(GenMedGPT-5k、CMCQA、ExplainCPE)中，MIRAGE在自动和人工评估中均优于GPT-4o、Tree-of-Thought变体和其他检索增强基线方法。

Conclusion: MIRAGE通过结构化知识图谱上的动态多链推理，显著提升了医疗问答的准确性和可解释性，为复杂医疗推理场景提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown significant progress in test-time
scaling through chain-of-thought prompting. Current approaches like search-o1
integrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into multi-step reasoning
processes but rely on a single, linear reasoning chain while incorporating
unstructured textual information in a flat, context-agnostic manner. As a
result, these approaches can lead to error accumulation throughout the
reasoning chain, which significantly limits its effectiveness in medical
question-answering (QA) tasks where both accuracy and traceability are critical
requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MIRAGE (Multi-chain
Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Graph Exploration), a novel test-time
scalable reasoning framework that performs dynamic multi-chain inference over
structured medical knowledge graphs. Specifically, MIRAGE 1) decomposes complex
queries into entity-grounded sub-questions, 2) executes parallel inference
chains, 3) retrieves evidence adaptively via neighbor expansion and multi-hop
traversal, and 4) integrates answers using cross-chain verification to resolve
contradictions. Experiments on three medical QA benchmarks (GenMedGPT-5k,
CMCQA, and ExplainCPE) show that MIRAGE consistently outperforms GPT-4o,
Tree-of-Thought variants, and other retrieval-augmented baselines in both
automatic and human evaluations. Additionally, MIRAGE improves interpretability
by generating explicit reasoning chains that trace each factual claim to
concrete chains within the knowledge graph, making it well-suited for complex
medical reasoning scenarios. The code will be available for further research.

Abstract: Accurate 3D geometry acquisition is essential for a wide range of
applications, such as computer graphics, autonomous driving, robotics, and
augmented reality. However, raw point clouds acquired in real-world
environments are often corrupted with noise due to various factors such as
sensor, lighting, material, environment etc, which reduces geometric fidelity
and degrades downstream performance. Point cloud denoising is a fundamental
problem, aiming to recover clean point sets while preserving underlying
structures. Classical optimization-based methods, guided by hand-crafted
filters or geometric priors, have been extensively studied but struggle to
handle diverse and complex noise patterns. Recent deep learning approaches
leverage neural network architectures to learn distinctive representations and
demonstrate strong outcomes, particularly on complex and large-scale point
clouds. Provided these significant advances, this survey provides a
comprehensive and up-to-date review of deep learning-based point cloud
denoising methods up to August 2025. We organize the literature from two
perspectives: (1) supervision level (supervised vs. unsupervised), and (2)
modeling perspective, proposing a functional taxonomy that unifies diverse
approaches by their denoising principles. We further analyze architectural
trends both structurally and chronologically, establish a unified benchmark
with consistent training settings, and evaluate methods in terms of denoising
quality, surface fidelity, point distribution, and computational efficiency.
Finally, we discuss open challenges and outline directions for future research
in this rapidly evolving field.

Motivation: 现有舞蹈生成方法缺乏编辑功能，无法满足实际编舞场景中用户迭代编辑的需求，且缺乏高质量的可编辑舞蹈数据集

Method: 采用预测-编辑范式，先基于音乐生成初始舞蹈，再通过跨模态编辑模块(CEM)整合音乐和文本提示进行迭代编辑

Result: 在新建的DanceRemix数据集上超越了现有最佳模型，生成的舞蹈既符合音乐节奏又保持与文本描述的细粒度语义对齐

Conclusion: DanceEditor框架成功实现了音乐驱动的可迭代编辑舞蹈生成，为实际编舞应用提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Generating coherent and diverse human dances from music signals has gained
tremendous progress in animating virtual avatars. While existing methods
support direct dance synthesis, they fail to recognize that enabling users to
edit dance movements is far more practical in real-world choreography
scenarios. Moreover, the lack of high-quality dance datasets incorporating
iterative editing also limits addressing this challenge. To achieve this goal,
we first construct DanceRemix, a large-scale multi-turn editable dance dataset
comprising the prompt featuring over 25.3M dance frames and 84.5K pairs. In
addition, we propose a novel framework for iterative and editable dance
generation coherently aligned with given music signals, namely DanceEditor.
Considering the dance motion should be both musical rhythmic and enable
iterative editing by user descriptions, our framework is built upon a
prediction-then-editing paradigm unifying multi-modal conditions. At the
initial prediction stage, our framework improves the authority of generated
results by directly modeling dance movements from tailored, aligned music.
Moreover, at the subsequent iterative editing stages, we incorporate text
descriptions as conditioning information to draw the editable results through a
specifically designed Cross-modality Editing Module (CEM). Specifically, CEM
adaptively integrates the initial prediction with music and text prompts as
temporal motion cues to guide the synthesized sequences. Thereby, the results
display music harmonics while preserving fine-grained semantic alignment with
text descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art models on our newly collected DanceRemix
dataset. Code is available at https://lzvsdy.github.io/DanceEditor/.

*Brian Chao,Jacqueline Yang,Suyeon Choi,Manu Gopakumar,Ryota Koiso,Gordon Wetzstein*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了随机相位高斯波溅射(GWS-RP)方法，通过引入随机相位分布来提升全息近眼显示器的带宽利用率，实现更大的眼盒、准确的散焦模糊和视差效果，并支持时间复用渲染来抑制散斑伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: GWS-RP方法显著提升了全息近眼显示器的性能，为下一代近眼显示系统提供了感知真实的3D全息显示能力。

Abstract: Holographic near-eye displays offer ultra-compact form factors for virtual
and augmented reality systems, but rely on advanced computer-generated
holography (CGH) algorithms to convert 3D scenes into interference patterns
that can be displayed on spatial light modulators (SLMs). Gaussian Wave
Splatting (GWS) has recently emerged as a powerful CGH paradigm that allows for
the conversion of Gaussians, a state-of-the-art neural 3D representation, into
holograms. However, GWS assumes smooth-phase distributions over the Gaussian
primitives, limiting their ability to model view-dependent effects and
reconstruct accurate defocus blur, and severely under-utilizing the
space-bandwidth product of the SLM. In this work, we propose random-phase GWS
(GWS-RP) to improve bandwidth utilization, which has the effect of increasing
eyebox size, reconstructing accurate defocus blur and parallax, and supporting
time-multiplexed rendering to suppress speckle artifacts.
  At the core of GWS-RP are (1) a fundamentally new wavefront compositing
procedure and (2) an alpha-blending scheme specifically designed for
random-phase Gaussian primitives, ensuring physically correct color
reconstruction and robust occlusion handling. Additionally, we present the
first formally derived algorithm for applying random phase to Gaussian
primitives, grounded in rigorous statistical optics analysis and validated
through practical near-eye display applications. Through extensive simulations
and experimental validations, we demonstrate that these advancements,
collectively with time-multiplexing, uniquely enables full-bandwith light field
CGH that supports accurate accurate parallax and defocus, yielding
state-of-the-art image quality and perceptually faithful 3D holograms for
next-generation near-eye displays.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的参考式线稿着色框架，通过分解着色过程为模块化阶段，使用不同的参考表示来优化着色质量，解决训练与推理时参考图像不对齐的问题。

Conclusion: 提出的模块化框架有效解决了参考图像与线稿不对齐的问题，提供了灵活的推理模式，显著提升了着色效果。

Abstract: Reference-based sketch colorization methods have garnered significant
attention for the potential application in animation and digital illustration
production. However, most existing methods are trained with image triplets of
sketch, reference, and ground truth that are semantically and spatially
similar, while real-world references and sketches often exhibit substantial
misalignment. This mismatch in data distribution between training and inference
leads to overfitting, consequently resulting in artifacts and signif- icant
quality degradation in colorization results. To address this issue, we conduct
an in-depth analysis of the reference representations, defined as the
intermedium to transfer information from reference to sketch. Building on this
analysis, we introduce a novel framework that leverages distinct reference
representations to optimize different aspects of the colorization process. Our
approach decomposes colorization into modular stages, al- lowing
region-specific reference injection to enhance visual quality and reference
similarity while mitigating spatial artifacts. Specifically, we first train a
backbone network guided by high-level semantic embeddings. We then introduce a
background encoder and a style encoder, trained in separate stages, to enhance
low-level feature transfer and improve reference similar- ity. This design also
enables flexible inference modes suited for a variety of use cases. Extensive
qualitative and quantitative evaluations, together with a user study,
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to
existing approaches. Code and pre-trained weight will be made publicly
available upon paper acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成3D内容主要使用网格或神经表示，而设计师使用参数化工具，这种表示不兼容影响了人工智能协作效率。需要生成结构化的建模历史序列，与设计师工作流程对齐。

Abstract: The emergence of 3D artificial intelligence-generated content (3D-AIGC) has
enabled rapid synthesis of intricate geometries. However, a fundamental
disconnect persists between AI-generated content and human-centric design
paradigms, rooted in representational incompatibilities: conventional AI
frameworks predominantly manipulate meshes or neural representations
(\emph{e.g.}, NeRF, Gaussian Splatting), while designers operate within
parametric modeling tools. This disconnection diminishes the practical value of
AI for 3D industry, undermining the efficiency of human-AI collaboration. To
resolve this disparity, we focus on generating design operation sequences,
which are structured modeling histories that comprehensively capture the
step-by-step construction process of 3D assets and align with designers'
typical workflows in modern 3D software. We first reformulate fundamental
modeling operations (\emph{e.g.}, \emph{Extrude}, \emph{Boolean}) into
differentiable units, enabling joint optimization of continuous (\emph{e.g.},
\emph{Extrude} height) and discrete (\emph{e.g.}, \emph{Boolean} type)
parameters via gradient-based learning. Based on these differentiable
operations, a hierarchical graph with gating mechanism is constructed and
optimized end-to-end by minimizing Chamfer Distance to target geometries.
Multi-stage sequence length constraint and domain rule penalties enable
unsupervised learning of compact design sequences without ground-truth sequence
supervision. Extensive validation demonstrates that the generated operation
sequences achieve high geometric fidelity, smooth mesh wiring, rational step
composition and flexible editing capacity, with full compatibility within
design industry.

Conclusion: MeshSplat通过2DGS桥接新视角合成和几何先验，成功解决了稀疏视图下的表面重建挑战，为相关领域提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Surface reconstruction has been widely studied in computer vision and
graphics. However, existing surface reconstruction works struggle to recover
accurate scene geometry when the input views are extremely sparse. To address
this issue, we propose MeshSplat, a generalizable sparse-view surface
reconstruction framework via Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to leverage
2DGS as a bridge, which connects novel view synthesis to learned geometric
priors and then transfers these priors to achieve surface reconstruction.
Specifically, we incorporate a feed-forward network to predict per-view
pixel-aligned 2DGS, which enables the network to synthesize novel view images
and thus eliminates the need for direct 3D ground-truth supervision. To improve
the accuracy of 2DGS position and orientation prediction, we propose a Weighted
Chamfer Distance Loss to regularize the depth maps, especially in overlapping
areas of input views, and also a normal prediction network to align the
orientation of 2DGS with normal vectors predicted by a monocular normal
estimator. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed
improvement, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in generalizable sparse-view mesh reconstruction tasks. Project

Abstract: Robotic cloth manipulation suffers from a lack of standardized benchmarks and
shared datasets for evaluating and comparing different approaches. To address
this, we created a benchmark and organized the ICRA 2024 Cloth Competition, a
unique head-to-head evaluation focused on grasp pose selection for in-air
robotic cloth unfolding. Eleven diverse teams participated in the competition,
utilizing our publicly released dataset of real-world robotic cloth unfolding
attempts and a variety of methods to design their unfolding approaches.
Afterwards, we also expanded our dataset with 176 competition evaluation
trials, resulting in a dataset of 679 unfolding demonstrations across 34
garments. Analysis of the competition results revealed insights about the
trade-off between grasp success and coverage, the surprisingly strong
achievements of hand-engineered methods and a significant discrepancy between
competition performance and prior work, underscoring the importance of
independent, out-of-the-lab evaluation in robotic cloth manipulation. The
associated dataset is a valuable resource for developing and evaluating grasp
selection methods, particularly for learning-based approaches. We hope that our
benchmark, dataset and competition results can serve as a foundation for future
benchmarks and drive further progress in data-driven robotic cloth

Method: 使用Genesis仿真环境生成程序化管道环境，设计奖励函数引导无人机通过航点并惩罚碰撞，比较PPO和SAC算法

Result: PPO学习到稳定策略，完成所有评估无碰撞，轨迹平滑；SAC收敛到次优行为，仅通过初始段就失败

Conclusion: 在危险密集导航中，on-policy方法的训练稳定性优于off-policy算法的样本效率，程序化高保真仿真是开发导航策略的有效测试平台

Abstract: Inspecting confined industrial infrastructure, such as ventilation shafts, is
a hazardous and inefficient task for humans. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
offer a promising alternative, but GPS-denied environments require robust
control policies to prevent collisions. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has
emerged as a powerful framework for developing such policies, and this paper
provides a comparative study of two leading DRL algorithms for this task: the
on-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and the off-policy Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC). The training was conducted with procedurally generated duct
environments in Genesis simulation environment. A reward function was designed
to guide a drone through a series of waypoints while applying a significant
penalty for collisions. PPO learned a stable policy that completed all
evaluation episodes without collision, producing smooth trajectories. By
contrast, SAC consistently converged to a suboptimal behavior that traversed
only the initial segments before failure. These results suggest that, in
hazard-dense navigation, the training stability of on-policy methods can
outweigh the nominal sample efficiency of off-policy algorithms. More broadly,
the study provides evidence that procedurally generated, high-fidelity
simulations are effective testbeds for developing and benchmarking robust
navigation policies.

Abstract: The fast development of technology and artificial intelligence has
significantly advanced Autonomous Vehicle (AV) research, emphasizing the need
for extensive simulation testing. Accurate and adaptable maps are critical in
AV development, serving as the foundation for localization, path planning, and
scenario testing. However, creating simulation-ready maps is often difficult
and resource-intensive, especially with simulators like CARLA (CAR Learning to
Act). Many existing workflows require significant computational resources or
rely on specific simulators, limiting flexibility for developers. This paper
presents a custom workflow to streamline map creation for AV development,
demonstrated through the generation of a 3D map of a parking lot at Ontario
Tech University. Future work will focus on incorporating SLAM technologies,
optimizing the workflow for broader simulator compatibility, and exploring more
flexible handling of latitude and longitude values to enhance map generation

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于李群切空间的广义恒定扭转运动先验，用于水下近距离操作中目标6自由度运动的估计，解决了因子图最大后验估计在缺乏运动先验时的欠约束问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下近距离操作中，追踪器缺乏目标侧的本体感知，可用的相对观测稀疏、嘈杂且通常不完整（如USBL位置）。没有运动先验时，因子图最大后验估计是欠约束的：连续目标状态关联弱，姿态容易漂移。

Method: 提出了定义在李群切空间上的广义恒定扭转运动先验，在SE(3)中将机体坐标系下的平移和旋转耦合。开发了三元因子并推导了基于标准李群操作的闭式雅可比矩阵，可在任意李群轨迹上即插即用。评估了两种部署模式：SE(3)表示和带边界因子的混合表示模式。

Result: 在真实动态对接场景数据集上的验证表明，该方法能够通过仅USBL和光学相对测量段实现一致的自车-目标轨迹估计，相比噪声测量提高了相对跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 该方法基于标准李群原语构建，可跨状态流形和感知模态移植，为水下6-DoF运动估计提供了有效的运动先验解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating a target's 6-DoF motion in underwater proximity operations is
difficult because the chaser lacks target-side proprioception and the available
relative observations are sparse, noisy, and often partial (e.g., Ultra-Short
Baseline (USBL) positions). Without a motion prior, factor-graph maximum a
posteriori estimation is underconstrained: consecutive target states are weakly
linked and orientation can drift. We propose a generalized constant-twist
motion prior defined on the tangent space of Lie groups that enforces
temporally consistent trajectories across all degrees of freedom; in SE(3) it
couples translation and rotation in the body frame. We present a ternary factor
and derive its closed-form Jacobians based on standard Lie group operations,
enabling drop-in use for trajectories on arbitrary Lie groups. We evaluate two
deployment modes: (A) an SE(3)-only representation that regularizes orientation
even when only position is measured, and (B) a mode with boundary factors that
switches the target representation between SE(3) and 3D position while applying
the same generalized constant-twist prior across representation changes.
Validation on a real-world dynamic docking scenario dataset shows consistent
ego-target trajectory estimation through USBL-only and optical relative
measurement segments with an improved relative tracking accuracy compared to
the noisy measurements to the target. Because the construction relies on
standard Lie group primitives, it is portable across state manifolds and
sensing modalities.

Abstract: We introduce HumanoidVerse, a novel framework for vision-language guided
humanoid control that enables a single physically simulated robot to perform
long-horizon, multi-object rearrangement tasks across diverse scenes. Unlike
prior methods that operate in fixed settings with single-object interactions,
our approach supports consecutive manipulation of multiple objects, guided only
by natural language instructions and egocentric camera RGB observations.
HumanoidVerse is trained via a multi-stage curriculum using a dual-teacher
distillation pipeline, enabling fluid transitions between sub-tasks without
requiring environment resets. To support this, we construct a large-scale
dataset comprising 350 multi-object tasks spanning four room layouts. Extensive
experiments in the Isaac Gym simulator demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art in both task success rate and
spatial precision, and generalizes well to unseen environments and
instructions. Our work represents a key step toward robust, general-purpose
humanoid agents capable of executing complex, sequential tasks under real-world

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了在保持高质量规划能力的同时，通过后训练获得多样化驾驶行为，满足动态指令驱动的自动驾驶需求

Abstract: Recent advances in motion planning for autonomous driving have led to models
capable of generating high-quality trajectories. However, most existing
planners tend to fix their policy after supervised training, leading to
consistent but rigid driving behaviors. This limits their ability to reflect
human preferences or adapt to dynamic, instruction-driven demands. In this
work, we propose a diffusion-based multi-head trajectory planner(M-diffusion
planner). During the early training stage, all output heads share weights to
learn to generate high-quality trajectories. Leveraging the probabilistic
nature of diffusion models, we then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to fine-tune the pre-trained model for diverse policy-specific
behaviors. At inference time, we incorporate a large language model (LLM) to
guide strategy selection, enabling dynamic, instruction-aware planning without
switching models. Closed-loop simulation demonstrates that our post-trained
planner retains strong planning capability while achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on the nuPlan val14 benchmark. Open-loop results further
show that the generated trajectories exhibit clear diversity, effectively
satisfying multi-modal driving behavior requirements. The code and related
experiments will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

Conclusion: HDSim框架通过结合认知理论和LLM辅助，显著提升了交通仿真的真实性和安全性评估效果，为自动驾驶系统测试提供了更可靠的仿真环境。

Abstract: Ensuring realistic traffic dynamics is a prerequisite for simulation
platforms to evaluate the reliability of self-driving systems before deployment
in the real world. Because most road users are human drivers, reproducing their
diverse behaviors within simulators is vital. Existing solutions, however,
typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or narrow data-driven models,
which capture only fragments of real driving behaviors and offer limited
driving style diversity and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce
HDSim, an HD traffic generation framework that combines cognitive theory with
large language model (LLM) assistance to produce scalable and realistic traffic
scenarios within simulation platforms. The framework advances the state of the
art in two ways: (i) it introduces a hierarchical driver model that represents
diverse driving style traits, and (ii) it develops a Perception-Mediated
Behavior Influence strategy, where LLMs guide perception to indirectly shape
driver actions. Experiments reveal that embedding HDSim into simulation
improves detection of safety-critical failures in self-driving systems by up to
68% and yields realism-consistent accident interpretability.

Abstract: Rigid registration, aiming to estimate a rigid transformation to align source
and target data, play a crucial role in applications such as SLAM and 3D
reconstruction. However, noisy, partially overlapping data and the need for
real-time processing pose major challenges for rigid registration. Considering
that feature-based matching can handle large transformation differences but
suffers from limited accuracy, while local geometry-based matching can achieve
fine-grained local alignment but relies heavily on a good initial
transformation, we propose a novel dual-space paradigm to fully leverage the
strengths of both approaches. First, we introduce an efficient filtering
mechanism that incorporates a computationally lightweight single-point RANSAC
algorithm followed by a refinement module to eliminate unreliable feature-based
correspondences. Subsequently, we treat filtered correspondences as anchor
points, extract geometric proxies, and formulates an effective objective
function with a tailored solver to estimate the transformation. Experiments
verify our method's effectiveness, as shown by achieving up to a 32x CPU-time
speedup over MAC on KITTI with comparable accuracy.

Abstract: As autonomous driving continues to advance, automated parking is becoming
increasingly essential. However, significant challenges arise when implementing
path velocity decomposition (PVD) trajectory planning for automated parking.
The primary challenge is ensuring rapid and precise collision-free trajectory
planning, which is often in conflict. The secondary challenge involves
maintaining sufficient control feasibility of the planned trajectory,
particularly at gear shifting points (GSP). This paper proposes a PVD-based
rapid iterative trajectory planning (RITP) method to solve the above
challenges. The proposed method effectively balances the necessity for time
efficiency and precise collision avoidance through a novel collision avoidance
framework. Moreover, it enhances the overall control feasibility of the planned
trajectory by incorporating the vehicle kinematics model and including terminal
smoothing constraints (TSC) at GSP during path planning. Specifically, the
proposed method leverages differential flatness to ensure the planned path
adheres to the vehicle kinematic model. Additionally, it utilizes TSC to
maintain curvature continuity at GSP, thereby enhancing the control feasibility
of the overall trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate superior time
efficiency and tracking errors compared to model-integrated and other
iteration-based trajectory planning methods. In the real-world experiment, the
proposed method was implemented and validated on a ROS-based vehicle,
demonstrating the applicability of the RITP method for real vehicles.

Abstract: We present a novel goal-conditioned recurrent state space (GC-RSSM) model
capable of learning latent dynamics of pick-and-place garment manipulation. Our
proposed method LaGarNet matches the state-of-the-art performance of mesh-based
methods, marking the first successful application of state-space models on
complex garments. LaGarNet trains on a coverage-alignment reward and a dataset
collected through a general procedure supported by a random policy and a
diffusion policy learned from few human demonstrations; it substantially
reduces the inductive biases introduced in the previous similar methods. We
demonstrate that a single-policy LaGarNet achieves flattening on four different
types of garments in both real-world and simulation settings.

Abstract: Adapting trajectories to dynamic situations and user preferences is crucial
for robot operation in unstructured environments with non-expert users. Natural
language enables users to express these adjustments in an interactive manner.
We introduce OVITA, an interpretable, open-vocabulary, language-driven
framework designed for adapting robot trajectories in dynamic and novel
situations based on human instructions. OVITA leverages multiple pre-trained
Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate user commands into trajectories
generated by motion planners or those learned through demonstrations. OVITA
employs code as an adaptation policy generated by an LLM, enabling users to
adjust individual waypoints, thus providing flexible control. Another LLM,
which acts as a code explainer, removes the need for expert users, enabling
intuitive interactions. The efficacy and significance of the proposed OVITA
framework is demonstrated through extensive simulations and real-world
environments with diverse tasks involving spatiotemporal variations on
heterogeneous robotic platforms such as a KUKA IIWA robot manipulator,
Clearpath Jackal ground robot, and CrazyFlie drone.

Abstract: Brain-body co-optimization remains a challenging problem, despite increasing
interest from the community in recent years. To understand and overcome the
challenges, we propose exhaustively mapping a morphology-fitness landscape to
study it. To this end, we train controllers for each feasible morphology in a
design space of 1,305,840 distinct morphologies, constrained by a computational
budget. First, we show that this design space constitutes a good model for
studying the brain-body co-optimization problem, and our attempt to
exhaustively map it roughly captures the landscape. We then proceed to analyze
how evolutionary brain-body co-optimization algorithms work in this design
space. The complete knowledge of the morphology-fitness landscape facilitates a
better understanding of the results of evolutionary brain-body co-optimization
algorithms and how they unfold over evolutionary time in the morphology space.
This investigation shows that the experimented algorithms cannot consistently
find near-optimal solutions. The search, at times, gets stuck on morphologies
that are sometimes one mutation away from better morphologies, and the
algorithms cannot efficiently track the fitness gradient in the
morphology-fitness landscape. We provide evidence that experimented algorithms
regularly undervalue the fitness of individuals with newly mutated bodies and,
as a result, eliminate promising morphologies throughout evolution. Our work
provides the most concrete demonstration of the challenges of evolutionary
brain-body co-optimization. Our findings ground the trends in the literature
and provide valuable insights for future work.

Abstract: Quadruped robots have emerged as highly efficient and versatile platforms,
excelling in navigating complex and unstructured terrains where traditional
wheeled robots might fail. Equipping these robots with manipulator arms unlocks
the advanced capability of loco-manipulation to perform complex physical
interaction tasks in areas ranging from industrial automation to
search-and-rescue missions. However, achieving precise and adaptable grasping
in such dynamic scenarios remains a significant challenge, often hindered by
the need for extensive real-world calibration and pre-programmed grasp
configurations. This paper introduces a deep learning framework designed to
enhance the grasping capabilities of quadrupeds equipped with arms, focusing on
improved precision and adaptability. Our approach centers on a sim-to-real
methodology that minimizes reliance on physical data collection. We developed a
pipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic
dataset of grasp attempts on common objects. By simulating thousands of
interactions from various perspectives, we created pixel-wise annotated
grasp-quality maps to serve as the ground truth for our model. This dataset was
used to train a custom CNN with a U-Net-like architecture that processes
multi-modal input from an onboard RGB and depth cameras, including RGB images,
depth maps, segmentation masks, and surface normal maps. The trained model
outputs a grasp-quality heatmap to identify the optimal grasp point. We
validated the complete framework on a four-legged robot. The system
successfully executed a full loco-manipulation task: autonomously navigating to
a target object, perceiving it with its sensors, predicting the optimal grasp
pose using our model, and performing a precise grasp. This work proves that
leveraging simulated training with advanced sensing offers a scalable and
effective solution for object handling.

Abstract: With the rise of modern deep learning, neural networks have become an
essential part of virtually every artificial intelligence system, making it
difficult even to imagine different models for intelligent behavior. In
contrast, nature provides us with many different mechanisms for intelligent
behavior, most of which we have yet to replicate. One of such underinvestigated
aspects of intelligence is embodiment and the role it plays in intelligent
behavior. In this work, we focus on how the simple and fixed behavior of
constituent parts of a simulated physical body can result in an emergent
behavior that can be classified as cognitive by an outside observer.
Specifically, we show how simulated voxels with fixed behaviors can be combined
to create a robot such that, when presented with an image of an MNIST digit
zero, it moves towards the left; and when it is presented with an image of an
MNIST digit one, it moves towards the right. Such robots possess what we refer
to as ``morphological cognition'' -- the ability to perform cognitive behavior
as a result of morphological processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first demonstration of a high-level mental faculty such as image
classification performed by a robot without any neural circuitry. We hope that
this work serves as a proof-of-concept and fosters further research into
different models of intelligence.

Abstract: Grasp synthesis is a fundamental task in robotic manipulation which usually
has multiple feasible solutions. Multimodal grasp synthesis seeks to generate
diverse sets of stable grasps conditioned on object geometry, making the robust
learning of geometric features crucial for success. To address this challenge,
we propose a framework for learning multimodal grasp distributions that
leverages variational shape inference to enhance robustness against shape noise
and measurement sparsity. Our approach first trains a variational autoencoder
for shape inference using implicit neural representations, and then uses these
learned geometric features to guide a diffusion model for grasp synthesis on
the SE(3) manifold. Additionally, we introduce a test-time grasp optimization
technique that can be integrated as a plugin to further enhance grasping
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our shape inference for
grasp synthesis formulation outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal grasp
synthesis methods on the ACRONYM dataset by 6.3%, while demonstrating
robustness to deterioration in point cloud density compared to other
approaches. Furthermore, our trained model achieves zero-shot transfer to
real-world manipulation of household objects, generating 34% more successful
grasps than baselines despite measurement noise and point cloud calibration
errors.

Abstract: Training robot policies within a learned world model is trending due to the
inefficiency of real-world interactions. The established image-based world
models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric
information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the
three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To
this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model
(GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by
inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot
actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D
variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state
reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual
representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future
prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports
model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments
depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse
robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform
the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling
potential of 3D world model.

Abstract: Event cameras offer microsecond latency, high dynamic range, and low power
consumption, making them ideal for real-time robotic perception under
challenging conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and illumination
changes. However, despite their advantages, synthetic event-based vision
remains largely unexplored in mainstream robotics simulators. This lack of
simulation setup hinders the evaluation of event-driven approaches for robotic
manipulation and navigation tasks. This work presents an open-source,
user-friendly v2e robotics operating system (ROS) package for Gazebo simulation
that enables seamless event stream generation from RGB camera feeds. The
package is used to investigate event-based robotic policies (ERP) for real-time
navigation and manipulation. Two representative scenarios are evaluated: (1)
object following with a mobile robot and (2) object detection and grasping with
a robotic manipulator. Transformer-based ERPs are trained by behavior cloning
and compared to RGB-based counterparts under various operating conditions.
Experimental results show that event-guided policies consistently deliver
competitive advantages. The results highlight the potential of event-driven
perception to improve real-time robotic navigation and manipulation, providing
a foundation for broader integration of event cameras into robotic policy
learning. The GitHub repo for the dataset and code:

Abstract: Various bipedal robots have been developed to date, and in recent years,
there has been a growing trend toward releasing these robots as open-source
platforms. This shift is fostering an environment in which anyone can freely
develop bipedal robots and share their knowledge, rather than relying solely on
commercial products. However, most existing open-source bipedal robots are
designed to be fabricated using 3D printers, which limits their scalability in
size and often results in fragile structures. On the other hand, some
metal-based bipedal robots have been developed, but they typically involve a
large number of components, making assembly difficult, and in some cases, the
parts themselves are not readily available through e-commerce platforms. To
address these issues, we developed MEVITA, an open-source bipedal robot that
can be built entirely from components available via e-commerce. Aiming for the
minimal viable configuration for a bipedal robot, we utilized sheet metal
welding to integrate complex geometries into single parts, thereby
significantly reducing the number of components and enabling easy assembly for
anyone. Through reinforcement learning in simulation and Sim-to-Real transfer,
we demonstrated robust walking behaviors across various environments,
confirming the effectiveness of our approach. All hardware, software, and
training environments can be obtained from https://github.com/haraduka/mevita .

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems in real-world settings need to
handle imperfect audio, often degraded by hardware limitations or environmental
noise, while accommodating diverse user groups. In human-robot interaction
(HRI), these challenges intersect to create a uniquely challenging recognition
environment. We evaluate four state-of-the-art ASR systems on eight publicly
available datasets that capture six dimensions of difficulty: domain-specific,
accented, noisy, age-variant, impaired, and spontaneous speech. Our analysis
demonstrates significant variations in performance, hallucination tendencies,
and inherent biases, despite similar scores on standard benchmarks. These
limitations have serious implications for HRI, where recognition errors can

Method: 提出FlexiSteps Network (FSN)框架，包含预训练的自适应预测模块(APM)评估和动态调整输出步长，设计动态解码器(DD)确保即插即用，并采用评分机制平衡预测步长和精度，使用Fréchet距离评估几何相似性。

Result: 在Argoverse和INTERACTION等基准数据集上的广泛实验证明了FSN框架的有效性和灵活性。

Conclusion: FSN框架通过动态调整预测时间步长，在保持预测精度的同时提高了适应性，为自动驾驶和智能决策系统提供了更优的轨迹预测解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is vital for autonomous driving, robotics, and
intelligent decision-making systems, yet traditional models typically rely on
fixed-length output predictions, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the FlexiSteps Network (FSN),
a novel framework that dynamically adjusts prediction output time steps based
on varying contextual conditions. Inspired by recent advancements addressing
observation length discrepancies and dynamic feature extraction, FSN
incorporates an pre-trained Adaptive Prediction Module (APM) to evaluate and
adjust the output steps dynamically, ensuring optimal prediction accuracy and
efficiency. To guarantee the plug-and-play of our FSN, we also design a Dynamic
Decoder(DD). Additionally, to balance the prediction time steps and prediction
accuracy, we design a scoring mechanism, which not only introduces the
Fr\'echet distance to evaluate the geometric similarity between the predicted
trajectories and the ground truth trajectories but the length of predicted
steps is also considered. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets
including Argoverse and INTERACTION demonstrate the effectiveness and
flexibility of our proposed FSN framework.

### [340] [Effect of Performance Feedback Timing on Motor Learning for a Surgical Training Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17830)
*Mary Kate Gale,Kailana Baker-Matsuoka,Ilana Nisky,Allison Okamura*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 实时多感官（触觉和视觉）错误反馈相比任务重放反馈或无反馈，能更好地提高机器人辅助微创手术训练的学习效果，特别是在环形定位和弯曲路径段的准确性方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人辅助微创手术（RMIS）已成为多种外科手术的金标准，但最佳的外科医生培训方法尚不清楚。研究假设实时错误反馈比任务后反馈能更好地提高学习速度和减少错误。

Method: 42名外科新手学习虚拟的环形穿线任务（RMIS训练中的经典任务）。研究比较了三组的多感官（触觉和视觉）反馈时机：(1)实时错误反馈；(2)任务重放错误反馈；(3)无错误反馈。

Result: 实时反馈组在环形定位方面表现最佳；重放反馈组在长直路径段的环形定位优于无反馈组；实时反馈组在紧密弯曲路径段的位置准确性优于其他组；各组在整体环形位置方面无显著差异。

Conclusion: 实时触觉和视觉错误反馈比任务重放反馈或无反馈能更好地改善虚拟手术任务的学习效果，这种新型培训方法可能使外科培训生以更快速度和更高准确性发展技能。

Abstract: Objective: Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) has become the
gold standard for a variety of surgical procedures, but the optimal method of
training surgeons for RMIS is unknown. We hypothesized that real-time, rather
than post-task, error feedback would better increase learning speed and reduce
errors. Methods: Forty-two surgical novices learned a virtual version of the
ring-on-wire task, a canonical task in RMIS training. We investigated the
impact of feedback timing with multi-sensory (haptic and visual) cues in three
groups: (1) real-time error feedback, (2) trial replay with error feedback, and
(3) no error feedback. Results: Participant performance was evaluated based on
the accuracy of ring position and orientation during the task. Participants who
received real-time feedback outperformed other groups in ring orientation.
Additionally, participants who received feedback in replay outperformed
participants who did not receive any error feedback on ring orientation during
long, straight path sections. There were no significant differences between
groups for ring position overall, but participants who received real-time
feedback outperformed the other groups in positional accuracy on tightly curved
path sections. Conclusion: The addition of real-time haptic and visual error
feedback improves learning outcomes in a virtual surgical task over error
feedback in replay or no error feedback at all. Significance: This work
demonstrates that multi-sensory error feedback delivered in real time leads to
better training outcomes as compared to the same feedback delivered after task
completion. This novel method of training may enable surgical trainees to
develop skills with greater speed and accuracy.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CubeDN是一个专为无人机3D检测设计的单阶段端到端雷达目标检测网络，采用双雷达配置和深度学习管道，在恶劣环境下实现分米级精度的无人机检测、定位和分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机广泛使用，需要确保安全性和安全性。光学传感器在恶劣光照和环境条件下性能下降，毫米波雷达成为更可靠的替代方案，但现有系统缺乏测量高度的能力，无法满足3D无人机检测需求。

Method: 提出CubeDN单阶段端到端雷达目标检测网络，采用双雷达配置解决仰角分辨率差的问题，通过新颖的深度学习管道同时实现无人机的检测、定位和分类。

Result: 系统能够同时检测和分类两种尺寸的无人机，在近距离实现分米级跟踪精度，整体平均精度(AP)达到95%，平均召回率(AR)达到85%，数据处理和推理速度为10Hz。

Conclusion: CubeDN系统在恶劣环境下表现出优异的3D无人机检测性能，具有高精度和高实时性，非常适合实际应用场景。

Abstract: As drone use has become more widespread, there is a critical need to ensure
safety and security. A key element of this is robust and accurate drone
detection and localization. While cameras and other optical sensors like LiDAR
are commonly used for object detection, their performance degrades under
adverse lighting and environmental conditions. Therefore, this has generated
interest in finding more reliable alternatives, such as millimeter-wave
(mmWave) radar. Recent research on mmWave radar object detection has
predominantly focused on 2D detection of road users. Although these systems
demonstrate excellent performance for 2D problems, they lack the sensing
capability to measure elevation, which is essential for 3D drone detection. To
address this gap, we propose CubeDN, a single-stage end-to-end radar object
detection network specifically designed for flying drones. CubeDN overcomes
challenges such as poor elevation resolution by utilizing a dual radar
configuration and a novel deep learning pipeline. It simultaneously detects,
localizes, and classifies drones of two sizes, achieving decimeter-level
tracking accuracy at closer ranges with overall $95\%$ average precision (AP)
and $85\%$ average recall (AR). Furthermore, CubeDN completes data processing
and inference at 10Hz, making it highly suitable for practical applications.

### [342] [Egocentric Instruction-oriented Affordance Prediction via Large Multimodal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17922)
*Bokai Ji,Jie Gu,Xiaokang Ma,Chu Tang,Jingmin Chen,Guangxia Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出任务/指令依赖的affordance概念，构建了包含1.5万个物体-指令-affordance三元组的数据集，并开发了基于大型多模态模型的"搜索验证"推理管道来预测affordance。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有affordance研究大多忽略了任务/指令依赖性，即同一物体在不同指令下会产生不同的操作区域和方向，这限制了智能机器人的物体操作能力。

Method: 构建了包含1.5万个egocentric视角的三元组数据集；提出"search against verifiers"管道，让大型多模态模型迭代预测affordance并在每一步进行自我验证，模拟推理过程。

Result: 实验表明该方法不仅解锁了新的指令导向affordance预测能力，而且在多个方面都取得了优异性能。

Conclusion: 任务/指令依赖的affordance概念是重要的，通过大型多模态模型的推理管道能够有效预测不同指令下的物体操作affordance，为智能机器人操作提供了新思路。

Abstract: Affordance is crucial for intelligent robots in the context of object
manipulation. In this paper, we argue that affordance should be
task-/instruction-dependent, which is overlooked by many previous works. That
is, different instructions can lead to different manipulation regions and
directions even for the same object. According to this observation, we present
a new dataset comprising fifteen thousand object-instruction-affordance
triplets. All scenes in the dataset are from an egocentric viewpoint, designed
to approximate the perspective of a human-like robot. Furthermore, we
investigate how to enable large multimodal models (LMMs) to serve as affordance
predictors by implementing a ``search against verifiers'' pipeline. An LMM is
asked to progressively predict affordances, with the output at each step being
verified by itself during the iterative process, imitating a reasoning process.
Experiments show that our method not only unlocks new instruction-oriented
affordance prediction capabilities, but also achieves outstanding performance
broadly.

Abstract: This paper introduces a holistic perception system for internal and external
monitoring of autonomous vehicles, with the aim of demonstrating a novel
AI-leveraged self-adaptive framework of advanced vehicle technologies and
solutions that optimize perception and experience on-board. Internal monitoring
system relies on a multi-camera setup designed for predicting and identifying
driver and occupant behavior through facial recognition, exploiting in addition
a large language model as virtual assistant. Moreover, the in-cabin monitoring
system includes AI-empowered smart sensors that measure air-quality and perform
thermal comfort analysis for efficient on and off-boarding. On the other hand,
external monitoring system perceives the surrounding environment of vehicle,
through a LiDAR-based cost-efficient semantic segmentation approach, that
performs highly accurate and efficient super-resolution on low-quality raw 3D
point clouds. The holistic perception framework is developed in the context of
EU's Horizon Europe programm AutoTRUST, and has been integrated and deployed on
a real electric vehicle provided by ALKE. Experimental validation and
evaluation at the integration site of Joint Research Centre at Ispra, Italy,
highlights increased performance and efficiency of the modular blocks of the
proposed perception architecture.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个结合上下文感知计算机视觉模型和ADORE自适应控制框架的自动驾驶系统，在CARLA模拟器中测试了恶劣天气条件下的鲁棒性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶在天气变化和未知物体等不确定条件下的安全问题，传统计算机视觉模型在这些场景下性能会下降。

Method: 将CARLA模拟器通过ROS桥与ADORE框架集成，结合上下文感知CV模型和自适应控制，在清晰和恶劣天气条件下进行模拟测试。

Result: 感知模型在恶劣天气条件下仍保持鲁棒检测性能，ADORE成功适应车速限制和障碍物，响应延迟低。

Conclusion: 深度学习感知与基于规则的自适应决策相结合，能够有效提升汽车安全关键系统的性能。

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving requires a seamless integration of
perception and decision making under uncertain conditions. Although computer
vision (CV) models such as YOLO achieve high accuracy in detecting traffic
signs and obstacles, their performance degrades in drift scenarios caused by
weather variations or unseen objects. This work presents a simulated autonomous
driving system that combines a context aware CV model with adaptive control
using the ADORE framework. The CARLA simulator was integrated with ADORE via
the ROS bridge, allowing real-time communication between perception, decision,
and control modules. A simulated test case was designed in both clear and drift
weather conditions to demonstrate the robust detection performance of the
perception model while ADORE successfully adapted vehicle behavior to speed
limits and obstacles with low response latency. The findings highlight the
potential of coupling deep learning-based perception with rule-based adaptive
decision making to improve automotive safety critical system.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种在完全无视觉输入情况下，仅依靠触觉反馈来搜索和抓取物体的机器人方法，利用覆盖整个机械臂表面的敏感皮肤进行接触感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人定位和抓取主要依赖视觉传感器，触觉反馈只是辅助。本研究探索在完全无视觉输入的情况下，仅依靠触觉反馈来搜索和抓取物体的极端情况。

Method: 将搜索分为两个阶段：(1) 使用完整机器人表面进行粗略的工作空间探索；(2) 使用配备力/力矩传感器的末端执行器进行精确定位。整个机械臂表面覆盖敏感皮肤来感知接触。

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人上系统评估，成功率为85.7%。使用全身接触的方法比仅使用末端执行器触觉反馈的基线方法快6倍。能够定位和抓取多个物体。

Conclusion: 该方法不限于特定设置，可部署在任何具有全身接触感知能力的平台上，在视觉感知具有挑战性的领域（如农业采摘）具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Locating and grasping of objects by robots is typically performed using
visual sensors. Haptic feedback from contacts with the environment is only
secondary if present at all. In this work, we explored an extreme case of
searching for and grasping objects in complete absence of visual input, relying
on haptic feedback only. The main novelty lies in the use of contacts over the
complete surface of a robot manipulator covered with sensitive skin. The search
is divided into two phases: (1) coarse workspace exploration with the complete
robot surface, followed by (2) precise localization using the end-effector
equipped with a force/torque sensor. We systematically evaluated this method in
simulation and on the real robot, demonstrating that diverse objects can be
located, grasped, and put in a basket. The overall success rate on the real
robot for one object was 85.7\% with failures mainly while grasping specific
objects. The method using whole-body contacts is six times faster compared to a
baseline that uses haptic feedback only on the end-effector. We also show
locating and grasping multiple objects on the table. This method is not
restricted to our specific setup and can be deployed on any platform with the
ability of sensing contacts over the entire body surface. This work holds
promise for diverse applications in areas with challenging visual perception
(due to lighting, dust, smoke, occlusion) such as in agriculture when fruits or
vegetables need to be located inside foliage and picked.

Abstract: Controlling high-dimensional and nonlinear musculoskeletal models of the
human body is a foundational scientific challenge. Recent machine learning
breakthroughs have heralded policies that master individual skills like
reaching, object manipulation and locomotion in musculoskeletal systems with
many degrees of freedom. However, these agents are merely "specialists",
achieving high performance for a single skill. In this work, we develop Arnold,
a generalist policy that masters multiple tasks and embodiments. Arnold
combines behavior cloning and fine-tuning with PPO to achieve expert or
super-expert performance in 14 challenging control tasks from dexterous object
manipulation to locomotion. A key innovation is Arnold's sensorimotor
vocabulary, a compositional representation of the semantics of heterogeneous
sensory modalities, objectives, and actuators. Arnold leverages this vocabulary
via a transformer architecture to deal with the variable observation and action
spaces of each task. This framework supports efficient multi-task,
multi-embodiment learning and facilitates rapid adaptation to novel tasks.
Finally, we analyze Arnold to provide insights into biological motor control,
corroborating recent findings on the limited transferability of muscle
synergies across tasks.

Motivation: 移动机器人遥操作中的通信延迟影响人机协作效果，但之前没有研究系统探索延迟对人类操作性能和神经认知的影响机制。

Method: 进行人在循环实验，经电10名参与者，整合电脑电图（EEG）和机器行为数据，在不同延迟水平（0-500ms，每次100ms增量）下系统分析。

Result: 行为分析显示200-300ms延迟导致性能显著退化；EEG分析发现前颖叶频/β带和顶叶α带功率显著受延迟影响；识别出100-200ms的早期延迟感知阈值窗口；当延迟超过400ms时所有特征达到饼和状态。

Conclusion: 这些发现提供了首次关于人类在遥操任务中感知和认知延迟阈值的证据，为延迟补偿策略的设计提供了关键的神经认知见解。

Abstract: Communication delays in mobile robot teleoperation adversely affect
human-machine collaboration. Understanding delay effects on human operational
performance and neurocognition is essential for resolving this issue. However,
no previous research has explored this. To fill this gap, we conduct a
human-in-the-loop experiment involving 10 participants, integrating
electroencephalography (EEG) and robot behavior data under varying delays
(0-500 ms in 100 ms increments) to systematically investigate these effects.
Behavior analysis reveals significant performance degradation at 200-300 ms
delays, affecting both task efficiency and accuracy. EEG analysis discovers
features with significant delay dependence: frontal $\theta/\beta$-band and
parietal $\alpha$-band power. We also identify a threshold window (100-200 ms)
for early perception of delay in humans, during which these EEG features first
exhibit significant differences. When delay exceeds 400 ms, all features
plateau, indicating saturation of cognitive resource allocation at
physiological limits. These findings provide the first evidence of perceptual
and cognitive delay thresholds during teleoperation tasks in humans, offering
critical neurocognitive insights for the design of delay compensation
strategies.

Conclusion: 混合驱动方法具有鲁棒性，腿和推进器的战略协同能够实现稳定 locomotion，空中相位需要特定的控制策略来处理关键的体-腿耦合动力学。

Abstract: This study presents an analysis of experimental data from Harpy, a
thruster-assisted bipedal robot developed at Northeastern University. The study
examines data sets from trotting and jumping experiments to understand the
fundamental principles governing hybrid leg-thruster locomotion. Through data
analysis across multiple locomotion modes, this research reveals that Harpy
achieves stable locomotion with bounded trajectories and consistent foot
placement through strategic leg-thruster synergy. The results demonstrate
controlled joint behavior with low torques and symmetric tracking, accurate
foot placement within kinematic constraints despite phase-transition
perturbations, and underactuated degree-of-freedom stability without
divergence. Energy level analysis reveals that legs provide primary propulsion,
while the thrusters enable additional aerial phase control. The analysis
identifies critical body-leg coupling dynamics during aerial phases that
require phase-specific control strategies. Consistent repeatability and
symmetry across experiments validate the robustness of the hybrid actuation
approach.

Conclusion: DANCeRS为需要分布式共识的多机器人系统提供了一个有前景的解决方案，能够在动态环境中实现可扩展和鲁棒的群体行为协调。

Abstract: Robot swarms require cohesive collective behaviour to address diverse
challenges, including shape formation and decision-making. Existing approaches
often treat consensus in discrete and continuous decision spaces as distinct
problems. We present DANCeRS, a unified, distributed algorithm leveraging
Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to achieve consensus in both domains. By
representing a swarm as a factor graph our method ensures scalability and
robustness in dynamic environments, relying on purely peer-to-peer message
passing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our general framework through two
applications where agents in a swarm must achieve consensus on global behaviour
whilst relying on local communication. In the first, robots must perform path
planning and collision avoidance to create shape formations. In the second, we
show how the same framework can be used by a group of robots to form a
consensus over a set of discrete decisions. Experimental results highlight our
method's scalability and efficiency compared to recent approaches to these
problems making it a promising solution for multi-robot systems requiring
distributed consensus. We encourage the reader to see the supplementary video
demo.

Motivation: 现有的自监督学习方法往往无法有效捕捉不可通行区域的特征，且大多专注于单一模态，忽视了多模态传感器融合的优势。需要开发更鲁棒的可通行性估计方法。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态自监督框架通过有效整合异构传感器模态，显著提升了可通行性估计的性能，证明了多模态融合在机器人导航中的重要性。

Abstract: Traversability estimation is critical for enabling robots to navigate across
diverse terrains and environments. While recent self-supervised learning
methods achieve promising results, they often fail to capture the
characteristics of non-traversable regions. Moreover, most prior works
concentrate on a single modality, overlooking the complementary strengths
offered by integrating heterogeneous sensory modalities for more robust
traversability estimation. To address these limitations, we propose a
multimodal self-supervised framework for traversability labeling and
estimation. First, our annotation pipeline integrates footprint, LiDAR, and
camera data as prompts for a vision foundation model, generating traversability
labels that account for both semantic and geometric cues. Then, leveraging
these labels, we train a dual-stream network that jointly learns from different
modalities in a decoupled manner, enhancing its capacity to recognize diverse
traversability patterns. In addition, we incorporate sparse LiDAR-based
supervision to mitigate the noise introduced by pseudo labels. Finally,
extensive experiments conducted across urban, off-road, and campus environments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed automatic labeling
method consistently achieves around 88% IoU across diverse datasets. Compared
to existing self-supervised state-of-the-art methods, our multimodal
traversability estimation network yields consistently higher IoU, improving by
1.6-3.5% on all evaluated datasets.

Motivation: 现有的扩散式策略学习方法在双手机器人操作中忽略了物理安全约束，导致可能损坏机器人和物体的危险行为。

Abstract: Bimanual manipulation has been widely applied in household services and
manufacturing, which enables the complex task completion with coordination
requirements. Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved
promising performance in modeling action distributions for bimanual
manipulation. However, they ignored the physical safety constraints of bimanual
manipulation, which leads to the dangerous behaviors with damage to robots and
objects. To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework
named SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation
policies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid
dangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design
diverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation
patterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and
objects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of
diffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM)
to schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding
pairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically
generated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual
demonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 13.7% increase
in success rate and a 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions over

TL;DR: FlowVLA是一个视觉-语言-动作模型，通过引入视觉思维链（Visual CoT）框架，先预测光流表示再生成未来帧，解决了传统下一帧预测中静态外观与动态运动纠缠的问题，在机器人操作任务中实现了最先进的性能和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的视觉-语言-动作模型通过下一帧预测训练内部世界模型，但这种方法在物理推理方面存在困难，因为它将静态外观与动态运动纠缠在一起，导致不合理的视觉预测和低效的策略学习。

Method: 提出了视觉思维链（Visual CoT）预训练框架，通过"当前帧→光流→下一帧"的推理过程，在单个自回归Transformer中实现。FlowVLA先生成中间光流表示编码运动动态，再预测未来帧，从而学习解耦的动态表示。

Result: 在具有挑战性的机器人操作基准测试中展示了最先进的性能，显著提高了样本效率，产生了连贯的视觉预测并促进了更高效的策略学习。

Conclusion: FlowVLA为世界建模提供了更原则性的基础，通过解耦动态学习实现了更好的物理推理能力和策略学习效率。

Abstract: Many Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on an internal world model
trained via next-frame prediction. This approach, however, struggles with
physical reasoning as it entangles static appearance with dynamic motion, often
resulting in implausible visual forecasts and inefficient policy learning. To
address these limitations, we introduce the Visual Chain of Thought (Visual
CoT): a pre-training framework that encourages a model to reason about how a
scene evolves before predicting what it will look like. We instantiate this
principle in FlowVLA, which predicts a future frame ($v_{t+1}$) only after
generating an intermediate optical flow representation ($f_t$) that encodes
motion dynamics. This ``$v_t \rightarrow f_t \rightarrow v_{t+1}$'' reasoning
process is implemented within a single autoregressive Transformer, guiding the
model to learn disentangled dynamics. As a result, FlowVLA produces coherent
visual predictions and facilitates more efficient policy learning. Experiments
on challenging robotics manipulation benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance with substantially improved sample efficiency, pointing toward a
more principled foundation for world modeling. Project page:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对基于规则的结巴检测系统进行全面分析，提出增强框架，在保持完全可解释性的同时实现竞争性性能，特别在延长音检测方面表现优异（97-99%准确率）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度学习在语音障碍检测方面取得进展，但在临床应用中，可解释性和透明度至关重要，基于规则的方法仍然不可或缺。

Method: 提出增强的基于规则框架，包含语速归一化、多级声学特征分析和分层决策结构，整合UCLASS、FluencyBank和SEP-28k等多个语料库的见解。

Result: 在延长音检测方面达到97-99%的准确率，在不同语速下提供稳定性能，可作为现代机器学习流程的提案生成器或约束模块。

Conclusion: 虽然神经方法在无约束环境下可能获得略高的准确率，但基于规则的方法在临床环境中具有独特优势，特别是在决策可审计性、患者特定调优和实时反馈方面。

Abstract: Stuttering affects approximately 1% of the global population, impacting
communication and quality of life. While recent advances in deep learning have
pushed the boundaries of automatic speech dysfluency detection, rule-based
approaches remain crucial for clinical applications where interpretability and
transparency are paramount. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of
rule-based stuttering detection systems, synthesizing insights from multiple
corpora including UCLASS, FluencyBank, and SEP-28k. We propose an enhanced
rule-based framework that incorporates speaking-rate normalization, multi-level
acoustic feature analysis, and hierarchical decision structures. Our approach
achieves competitive performance while maintaining complete
interpretability-critical for clinical adoption. We demonstrate that rule-based
systems excel particularly in prolongation detection (97-99% accuracy) and
provide stable performance across varying speaking rates. Furthermore, we show
how these interpretable models can be integrated with modern machine learning
pipelines as proposal generators or constraint modules, bridging the gap
between traditional speech pathology practices and contemporary AI systems. Our
analysis reveals that while neural approaches may achieve marginally higher
accuracy in unconstrained settings, rule-based methods offer unique advantages
in clinical contexts where decision auditability, patient-specific tuning, and
real-time feedback are essential.

Motivation: 理解影响学生数学表现的因素，为设计有效教育政策提供基础，并通过可解释性AI技术探索跨国演变模式

Method: 使用PISA 2018数据（67,329名学生），测试四种模型：多元线性回归、随机森林、CATBoost咊人工神经网络。采用70%数据训练（五折交叉验证）+30%测试，使用R²咊MAE评估性能，通过特征重要性、SHAP值等确保可解释性

Abstract: Understanding the factors that shape students' mathematics performance is
vital for designing effective educational policies. This study applies
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to PISA 2018 data to
predict math achievement and identify key predictors across ten countries
(67,329 students). We tested four models: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR),
Random Forest (RF), CATBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), using
student, family, and school variables. Models were trained on 70% of the data
(with 5-fold cross-validation) and tested on 30%, stratified by country.
Performance was assessed with R^2 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). To ensure
interpretability, we used feature importance, SHAP values, and decision tree
visualizations. Non-linear models, especially RF and ANN, outperformed MLR,
with RF balancing accuracy and generalizability. Key predictors included
socio-economic status, study time, teacher motivation, and students' attitudes
toward mathematics, though their impact varied across countries. Visual
diagnostics such as scatterplots of predicted vs actual scores showed RF and
CATBoost aligned closely with actual performance. Findings highlight the
non-linear and context-dependent nature of achievement and the value of XAI in
educational research. This study uncovers cross-national patterns, informs
equity-focused reforms, and supports the development of personalized learning
strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在ICD编码方面虽然准确率提升，但缺乏可解释性，影响了临床应用的信任度。现有方法主要依赖注意力机制和定性评估，缺乏系统性评估和专门的解释生成方法。

Method: 1) 从忠实度和合理性两个维度评估可解释性；2) 构建新的标注数据集；3) 利用LLM生成解释作为远程监督信号；4) 提出新的解释学习方法，结合少样本人工标注示例。

Result: LLM生成的解释与人类专家判断最为接近，结合少样本人工标注示例不仅能进一步改善解释生成，还能提升解释学习方法的效果。

Conclusion: LLM在生成临床编码解释方面表现出色，结合人工标注的少样本学习能有效提升模型的可解释性，为临床可信AI系统的发展提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Automated clinical coding involves mapping unstructured text from Electronic
Health Records (EHRs) to standardized code systems such as the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD). While recent advances in deep learning have
significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of ICD coding, the lack of
explainability in these models remains a major limitation, undermining trust
and transparency. Current explorations about explainability largely rely on
attention-based techniques and qualitative assessments by physicians, yet lack
systematic evaluation using consistent criteria on high-quality rationale
datasets, as well as dedicated approaches explicitly trained to generate
rationales for further enhancing explanation. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of the explainability of the rationales for ICD coding
through two key lenses: faithfulness that evaluates how well explanations
reflect the model's actual reasoning and plausibility that measures how
consistent the explanations are with human expert judgment. To facilitate the
evaluation of plausibility, we construct a new rationale-annotated dataset,
offering denser annotations with diverse granularity and aligns better with
current clinical practice, and conduct evaluation across three types of
rationales of ICD coding. Encouraged by the promising plausibility of
LLM-generated rationales for ICD coding, we further propose new rationale
learning methods to improve the quality of model-generated rationales, where
rationales produced by prompting LLMs with/without annotation examples are used
as distant supervision signals. We empirically find that LLM-generated
rationales align most closely with those of human experts. Moreover,
incorporating few-shot human-annotated examples not only further improves
rationale generation but also enhances rationale-learning approaches.

Motivation: 现有的GPU加速学习环境通常提供固定游戏集的硬编码实现，缺乏灵活性。PuzzleJAX旨在支持动态编译任何可表达的游戏，覆盖更广泛、更具表达力的人类相关任务空间。

Method: 基于PuzzleScript的领域特定语言(DSL)，设计GPU加速的益智游戏引擎，支持动态游戏编译。验证了数百个自2013年以来由专业设计师和休闲创作者设计的PuzzleScript游戏。

Result: PuzzleJAX能够自然表达既简单直观又极具挑战性的任务，需要控制、规划和高层次洞察力的结合。展示了在搜索、学习和语言模型性能分析方面的应用价值。

Conclusion: PuzzleJAX提供了一个表达力强、人类相关且可扩展的基准测试平台，适用于评估各种AI算法的推理和问题解决能力。

Abstract: We introduce PuzzleJAX, a GPU-accelerated puzzle game engine and description
language designed to support rapid benchmarking of tree search, reinforcement
learning, and LLM reasoning abilities. Unlike existing GPU-accelerated learning
environments that provide hard-coded implementations of fixed sets of games,
PuzzleJAX allows dynamic compilation of any game expressible in its
domain-specific language (DSL). This DSL follows PuzzleScript, which is a
popular and accessible online game engine for designing puzzle games. In this
paper, we validate in PuzzleJAX several hundred of the thousands of games
designed in PuzzleScript by both professional designers and casual creators
since its release in 2013, thereby demonstrating PuzzleJAX's coverage of an
expansive, expressive, and human-relevant space of tasks. By analyzing the
performance of search, learning, and language models on these games, we show
that PuzzleJAX can naturally express tasks that are both simple and intuitive
to understand, yet often deeply challenging to master, requiring a combination
of control, planning, and high-level insight.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种医疗专用的视觉-语言模型框架，用于编排临床工作流，通过单个VLM模型同时实现模型选择和任务执行的双重功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床工作流分散化问题，应对多个脚本和任务特定网络造成的效率低下和运营成本高的挑战，缺乏数据驱动的模型识别和标准化输出交付。

Method: 使用单个视觉-语言模型(VLM)在两种补充角色中：1)模型卡片匹配器，通过三阶段工作流路由图像；2)细调VLM以覆盖专业内多个下游任务。包含阶段性提示和答案选择器保障准确性。

Result: 在消化内科、血液学、眼科学和病理学领域，单模型部署表现跟专门基准相当或接近，而且更简化。

Conclusion: 这种方法证明一个VLM可以同时决策和执行，可能减少数据科学家的工作量，缩短监控时间，提高模型选择的透明度，并降低集成复杂性。

Abstract: Clinical workflows are fragmented as a patchwork of scripts and task-specific
networks that often handle triage, task selection, and model deployment. These
pipelines are rarely streamlined for data science pipeline, reducing efficiency
and raising operational costs. Workflows also lack data-driven model
identification (from imaging/tabular inputs) and standardized delivery of model
outputs. In response, we present a practical, healthcare-first framework that
uses a single vision-language model (VLM) in two complementary roles. First
(Solution 1), the VLM acts as an aware model-card matcher that routes an
incoming image to the appropriate specialist model via a three-stage workflow
(modality -> primary abnormality -> model-card id). Checks are provided by (i)
stagewise prompts that allow early exit via None/Normal/Other and (ii) a
stagewise answer selector that arbitrates between the top-2 candidates at each
stage, reducing the chance of an incorrect selection and aligning the workflow
with clinical risk tolerance. Second (Solution 2), we fine-tune the VLM on
specialty-specific datasets ensuring a single model covers multiple downstream
tasks within each specialty, maintaining performance while simplifying
deployment. Across gastroenterology, hematology, ophthalmology, and pathology,
our single-model deployment matches or approaches specialized baselines.
  Compared with pipelines composed of many task-specific agents, this approach
shows that one VLM can both decide and do. It may reduce effort by data
scientists, shorten monitoring, increase the transparency of model selection
(with per-stage justifications), and lower integration overhead.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出使用贝叶斯框架来量化LLM中的谄媚行为，通过测量与理性行为的偏差来评估谄媚程度，即使在没有真实标签的任务中也能有效工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要通过行为变化或准确率来衡量谄媚行为，但这些方法无法表征理性变化，且准确率方法仅适用于有真实标签的场景。需要一种能评估理性偏差的新方法。

Method: 采用贝叶斯框架，通过比较LLM在引入用户观点前后的后验概率变化来量化谄媚行为。研究了3个不同任务、开源和闭源LLM，以及多种概率判断方法。

Result: 发现：1）LLM不是贝叶斯理性的；2）谄媚探测导致后验概率显著偏向引导结果；3）谄媚有时增加贝叶斯误差，少数情况下减少误差；4）贝叶斯误差变化与Brier分数相关性不强。

Conclusion: 仅研究谄媚对真实标签的影响不能完全捕捉推理错误，贝叶斯框架能更好地评估谄媚导致的理性偏差，特别是在不确定或无真实标签的任务中。

Abstract: Sycophancy, or overly agreeable or flattering behavior, is a documented issue
in large language models (LLMs), and is critical to understand in the context
of human/AI collaboration. Prior works typically quantify sycophancy by
measuring shifts in behavior or impacts on accuracy, but neither metric
characterizes shifts in rationality, and accuracy measures can only be used in
scenarios with a known ground truth. In this work, we utilize a Bayesian
framework to quantify sycophancy as deviations from rational behavior when
presented with user perspectives, thus distinguishing between rational and
irrational updates based on the introduction of user perspectives. In
comparison to other methods, this approach allows us to characterize excessive
behavioral shifts, even for tasks that involve inherent uncertainty or do not
have a ground truth. We study sycophancy for 3 different tasks, a combination
of open-source and closed LLMs, and two different methods for probing
sycophancy. We also experiment with multiple methods for eliciting probability
judgments from LLMs. We hypothesize that probing LLMs for sycophancy will cause
deviations in LLMs' predicted posteriors that will lead to increased Bayesian
error. Our findings indicate that: 1) LLMs are not Bayesian rational, 2)
probing for sycophancy results in significant increases to the predicted
posterior in favor of the steered outcome, 3) sycophancy sometimes results in
increased Bayesian error, and in a small number of cases actually decreases
error, and 4) changes in Bayesian error due to sycophancy are not strongly
correlated in Brier score, suggesting that studying the impact of sycophancy on
ground truth alone does not fully capture errors in reasoning due to
sycophancy.

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向更可解释和可信的图表分析系统迈出的重要一步，使用户能够通过推理和归因来验证和理解模型决策。

Abstract: Data visualizations like charts are fundamental tools for quantitative
analysis and decision-making across fields, requiring accurate interpretation
and mathematical reasoning. The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) offers promising capabilities for automated visual data analysis, such
as processing charts, answering questions, and generating summaries. However,
they provide no visibility into which parts of the visual data informed their
conclusions; this black-box nature poses significant challenges to real-world
trust and adoption. In this paper, we take the first major step towards
evaluating and enhancing the capabilities of MLLMs to attribute their reasoning
process by highlighting the specific regions in charts and graphs that justify
model answers. To this end, we contribute RADAR, a semi-automatic approach to
obtain a benchmark dataset comprising 17,819 diverse samples with charts,
questions, reasoning steps, and attribution annotations. We also introduce a
method that provides attribution for chart-based mathematical reasoning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our reasoning-guided approach improves
attribution accuracy by 15% compared to baseline methods, and enhanced
attribution capabilities translate to stronger answer generation, achieving an
average BERTScore of $\sim$ 0.90, indicating high alignment with ground truth
responses. This advancement represents a significant step toward more
interpretable and trustworthy chart analysis systems, enabling users to verify
and understand model decisions through reasoning and attribution.

Motivation: 无限论证框架虽然表达能力强，但计算复杂性限制了其实际应用。研究旨在探索有限性无限框架的计算特性，寻找表达能力和计算可行性之间的平衡。

Method: 通过理论分析研究无限但有限性论证框架的计算复杂性，特别关注每个论证只被有限个其他论证攻击的情况。

Result: 发现有限性假设并不自动保证复杂性降低，但对于基于可接受性的语义，存在显著的组合约束导致复杂度大幅下降。

Conclusion: 有限性无限论证框架为许多推理形式提供了自然设置，在表达能力和计算可行性之间达到了良好平衡，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Abstract argumentation frameworks (AFs) provide a formal setting to analyze
many forms of reasoning with conflicting information. While the expressiveness
of general infinite AFs make them a tempting tool for modeling many kinds of
reasoning scenarios, the computational intractability of solving infinite AFs
limit their use, even in many theoretical applications.
  We investigate the complexity of computational problems related to infinite
but finitary argumentations frameworks, that is, infinite AFs where each
argument is attacked by only finitely many others. Our results reveal a
surprising scenario. On one hand, we see that the assumption of being finitary
does not automatically guarantee a drop in complexity. However, for the
admissibility-based semantics, we find a remarkable combinatorial constraint
which entails a dramatic decrease in complexity.
  We conclude that for many forms of reasoning, the finitary infinite AFs
provide a natural setting for reasoning which balances well the competing goals
of being expressive enough to be applied to many reasoning settings while being
computationally tractable enough for the analysis within the framework to be
useful.

Conclusion: GaS框架通过联合训练强化学习和分割算法，有效解决了传统两阶段方法的优化不一致问题，为多旅行商最小最大路径问题提供了高质量的近似解

Abstract: This study addresses the Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem
($m^3$-TSP), which aims to coordinate tours for multiple salesmen such that the
length of the longest tour is minimized. Due to its NP-hard nature, exact
solvers become impractical under the assumption that $P \ne NP$. As a result,
learning-based approaches have gained traction for their ability to rapidly
generate high-quality approximate solutions. Among these, two-stage methods
combine learning-based components with classical solvers, simplifying the
learning objective. However, this decoupling often disrupts consistent
optimization, potentially degrading solution quality. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage framework named \textbf{Generate-and-Split} (GaS),
which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with an optimal splitting
algorithm in a joint training process. The splitting algorithm offers
near-linear scalability with respect to the number of cities and guarantees
optimal splitting in Euclidean space for any given path. To facilitate the
joint optimization of the RL component with the algorithm, we adopt an
LSTM-enhanced model architecture to address partial observability. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed GaS framework significantly outperforms
existing learning-based approaches in both solution quality and
transferability.

Abstract: Due to the rapid pace of electrification and decarbonization, distribution
grid (DG) operation and planning are becoming more complex, necessitating
advanced computational analyses to ensure grid reliability and resilience.
State-of-the-art DG analyses rely on disparate workflows of complex models,
functions, and data pipelines, which require expert knowledge and are
challenging to automate. Many small-scale utilities and cooperatives lack a
large R&D workforce and therefore cannot use advanced analysis at scale. To
address this gap, we develop a novel agentic AI system, PowerChain, to solve
unseen DG analysis tasks via automated agentic orchestration and large language
models (LLMs) function-calling. Given a natural language query, PowerChain
dynamically generates and executes an ordered sequence of domain-aware
functions guided by the semantics of an expert-built power systems function
pool and a select reference set of known, expert-generated workflow-query
pairs. Our results show that PowerChain can produce expert-level workflows with
both GPT-5 and open-source Qwen models on complex, unseen DG analysis tasks
operating on real utility data.

Abstract: The concepts of ``human-centered AI'' and ``value-based decision'' have
gained significant attention in both research and industry. However, many
critical aspects remain underexplored and require further investigation. In
particular, there is a need to understand how systems incorporate human values,
how humans can identify these values within systems, and how to minimize the
risks of harm or unintended consequences. In this paper, we highlight the need
to rethink how we frame value alignment and assert that value alignment should
move beyond static and singular conceptions of values. We argue that AI systems
should implement long-term reasoning and remain adaptable to evolving values.
Furthermore, value alignment requires more theories to address the full
spectrum of human values. Since values often vary among individuals or groups,
multi-agent systems provide the right framework for navigating pluralism,
conflict, and inter-agent reasoning about values. We identify the challenges

### [366] [MaRVL-QA: A Benchmark for Mathematical Reasoning over Visual Landscapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17180)
*Nilay Pande,Sahiti Yerramilli,Jayant Sravan Tamarapalli,Rynaa Grover*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MaRVL-QA是一个新的多模态大语言模型基准测试，专注于数学表面图的空间推理能力评估，包含拓扑计数和变换识别两个任务，发现当前最先进模型仍存在显著困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在语义描述方面已很成功，但在深度数学和空间推理方面仍有待突破。数学表面图提供了一个理想的测试平台，能够隔离自然图像中的语义噪声，专注于核心推理能力。

Method: 通过精心策划的函数库生成数学表面图，并进行严格的歧义过滤，构建了包含拓扑计数（识别和枚举局部极值等特征）和变换识别（识别几何变换）两个新任务的MaRVL-QA基准测试。

Result: 评估结果显示，即使是当前最先进的多模态大语言模型在MaRVL-QA上也表现困难，往往依赖表面启发式方法而非稳健的空间推理能力。

Conclusion: MaRVL-QA为研究社区提供了一个具有挑战性的新工具，可用于衡量进展、暴露模型局限性，并指导开发具有更深层次推理能力的多模态大语言模型。

Abstract: A key frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is the ability to
perform deep mathematical and spatial reasoning directly from images, moving
beyond their established success in semantic description. Mathematical surface
plots provide a rigorous testbed for this capability, as they isolate the task
of reasoning from the semantic noise common in natural images. To measure
progress on this frontier, we introduce MaRVL-QA (Mathematical Reasoning over
Visual Landscapes), a new benchmark designed to quantitatively evaluate these
core reasoning skills. The benchmark comprises two novel tasks: Topological
Counting, identifying and enumerating features like local maxima; and
Transformation Recognition, recognizing applied geometric transformations.
Generated from a curated library of functions with rigorous ambiguity
filtering, our evaluation on MaRVL-QA reveals that even state-of-the-art MLLMs
struggle significantly, often resorting to superficial heuristics instead of
robust spatial reasoning. MaRVL-QA provides a challenging new tool for the
research community to measure progress, expose model limitations, and guide the
development of MLLMs with more profound reasoning abilities.

TL;DR: PosterGen是一个基于多智能体LLM的框架，用于自动化论文海报生成，通过四个专业代理协作实现内容提取、布局设计、视觉美化和最终渲染，显著提升了海报的视觉设计质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人员准备会议海报是一个耗时过程，现有自动化方法大多忽视核心设计和美学原则，生成的海报需要大量人工修改。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包含四个专业代理：解析器提取论文内容、策展人组织故事板、布局代理设计空间布局、造型师应用视觉元素、渲染器合成最终海报。

Result: 实验结果显示PosterGen在内容保真度上与现有方法相当，但在视觉设计方面显著优于现有方法，生成的海报几乎无需人工修改即可使用。

Conclusion: 多智能体LLM框架能够有效模拟专业海报设计师的工作流程，生成既语义准确又视觉吸引人的高质量学术海报。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built upon large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in tackling complex compositional tasks. In this work,
we apply this paradigm to the paper-to-poster generation problem, a practical
yet time-consuming process faced by researchers preparing for conferences.
While recent approaches have attempted to automate this task, most neglect core
design and aesthetic principles, resulting in posters that require substantial
manual refinement. To address these design limitations, we propose PosterGen, a
multi-agent framework that mirrors the workflow of professional poster
designers. It consists of four collaborative specialized agents: (1) Parser and
Curator agents extract content from the paper and organize storyboard; (2)
Layout agent maps the content into a coherent spatial layout; (3) Stylist
agents apply visual design elements such as color and typography; and (4)
Renderer composes the final poster. Together, these agents produce posters that
are both semantically grounded and visually appealing. To evaluate design
quality, we introduce a vision-language model (VLM)-based rubric that measures
layout balance, readability, and aesthetic coherence. Experimental results show
that PosterGen consistently matches in content fidelity, and significantly
outperforms existing methods in visual designs, generating posters that are
presentation-ready with minimal human refinements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在具身导航中缺乏结构化的空间记忆，只能进行反应式操作，限制了在复杂真实环境中的泛化能力和适应性。

Method: 构建以自我中心轨迹和上下文线索为基础的同中心认知地图，动态检索与语义目标对齐的空间知识，并与强大的多模态大语言模型集成。

Conclusion: BSC-Nav提供了一个可扩展且基于生物学基础的方法，为实现通用空间智能开辟了道路。

Abstract: Spatial cognition enables adaptive goal-directed behavior by constructing
internal models of space. Robust biological systems consolidate spatial
knowledge into three interconnected forms: \textit{landmarks} for salient cues,
\textit{route knowledge} for movement trajectories, and \textit{survey
knowledge} for map-like representations. While recent advances in multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have enabled visual-language reasoning in
embodied agents, these efforts lack structured spatial memory and instead
operate reactively, limiting their generalization and adaptability in complex
real-world environments. Here we present Brain-inspired Spatial Cognition for
Navigation (BSC-Nav), a unified framework for constructing and leveraging
structured spatial memory in embodied agents. BSC-Nav builds allocentric
cognitive maps from egocentric trajectories and contextual cues, and
dynamically retrieves spatial knowledge aligned with semantic goals. Integrated
with powerful MLLMs, BSC-Nav achieves state-of-the-art efficacy and efficiency
across diverse navigation tasks, demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization,
and supports versatile embodied behaviors in the real physical world, offering
a scalable and biologically grounded path toward general-purpose spatial
intelligence.

Abstract: This paper presents the first integrated systematic study on the performance
of large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to automatically
formulate and solve stochastic optimiza- tion problems from natural language
descriptions. Focusing on three key categories, joint chance- constrained
models, individual chance-constrained models, and two-stage stochastic linear
programs (SLP-2), we design several prompts that guide ChatGPT through
structured tasks using chain-of- thought and modular reasoning. We introduce a
novel soft scoring metric that evaluates the struc- tural quality and partial
correctness of generated models, addressing the limitations of canonical and
execution-based accuracy. Across a diverse set of stochastic problems,
GPT-4-Turbo outperforms other models in partial score, variable matching, and
objective accuracy, with cot_s_instructions and agentic emerging as the most
effective prompting strategies. Our findings reveal that with well-engineered
prompts and multi-agent collaboration, LLMs can facilitate specially stochastic
formulations, paving the way for intelligent, language-driven modeling
pipelines in stochastic opti- mization.

(HAM-D), causally influence the prescription of SSRIs versus SNRIs. Methods: We
applied explainable counterfactual reasoning with counterfactual explanations
(CFs) to assess the impact of specific symptom changes on antidepressant
choice. Results: Among 17 binary classifiers, Random Forest achieved highest

CFs revealed both local and global feature importance of individual symptoms in
medication selection. Conclusions: Counterfactual reasoning elucidates which
MDD symptoms most strongly drive SSRI versus SNRI selection, enhancing
interpretability of AI-based clinical decision support systems. Future work

TL;DR: 开发了一个在线自适应临床决策支持系统，使用强化学习策略、患者数字孪生环境和治疗效果奖励，通过安全约束和专家查询机制实现实时调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策支持系统需要在线自适应调整，同时确保安全性约束，将离线策略转化为持续临床监督系统。

Method: 使用批量约束策略初始化，通过五网络集成计算不确定性，数字孪生更新患者状态，安全门检查生命体征和禁忌症，仅在不确定性高时咨询专家。

Result: 在合成临床模拟器中显示低延迟、稳定吞吐量、低专家查询率，并在固定安全条件下相比标准价值基线获得更高回报。

Conclusion: 该系统成功将离线策略转化为具有明确控制和快速适应能力的持续临床监督系统。

Abstract: Clinical decision support must adapt online under safety constraints. We
present an online adaptive tool where reinforcement learning provides the
policy, a patient digital twin provides the environment, and treatment effect
defines the reward. The system initializes a batch-constrained policy from
retrospective data and then runs a streaming loop that selects actions, checks
safety, and queries experts only when uncertainty is high. Uncertainty comes
from a compact ensemble of five Q-networks via the coefficient of variation of
action values with a $\tanh$ compression. The digital twin updates the patient
state with a bounded residual rule. The outcome model estimates immediate
clinical effect, and the reward is the treatment effect relative to a
conservative reference with a fixed z-score normalization from the training
split. Online updates operate on recent data with short runs and exponential
moving averages. A rule-based safety gate enforces vital ranges and
contraindications before any action is applied. Experiments in a synthetic
clinical simulator show low latency, stable throughput, a low expert query rate
at fixed safety, and improved return against standard value-based baselines.
The design turns an offline policy into a continuous, clinician-supervised
system with clear controls and fast adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在高风险决策中应用日益广泛，需要透明可解释的结果，但现有解释方法可能泄露专有算法，需要在透明性和算法保护之间找到平衡

Method: 使用模型无关的可解释规则替代模型来近似黑盒模型，生成能产生有利结果的对抗样本，并通过因果约束排除自动发生的特征变化，只计算用户主动改变所需的努力

Result: MC3G相比现有技术提供更可解释和可操作的对抗建议，同时具有更低的成本

Conclusion: MC3G有潜力增强机器学习决策过程的透明度、问责制和实际效用

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly influence decisions in high-stakes
settings such as finance, law and hiring, driving the need for transparent,
interpretable outcomes. However, while explainable approaches can help
understand the decisions being made, they may inadvertently reveal the
underlying proprietary algorithm: an undesirable outcome for many
practitioners. Consequently, it is crucial to balance meaningful transparency
with a form of recourse that clarifies why a decision was made and offers
actionable steps following which a favorable outcome can be obtained.
Counterfactual explanations offer a powerful mechanism to address this need by
showing how specific input changes lead to a more favorable prediction. We
propose Model-Agnostic Causally Constrained Counterfactual Generation (MC3G), a
novel framework that tackles limitations in the existing counterfactual
methods. First, MC3G is model-agnostic: it approximates any black-box model
using an explainable rule-based surrogate model. Second, this surrogate is used
to generate counterfactuals that produce a favourable outcome for the original
underlying black box model. Third, MC3G refines cost computation by excluding
the ``effort" associated with feature changes that occur automatically due to
causal dependencies. By focusing only on user-initiated changes, MC3G provides
a more realistic and fair representation of the effort needed to achieve a
favourable outcome. We show that MC3G delivers more interpretable and
actionable counterfactual recommendations compared to existing techniques all
while having a lower cost. Our findings highlight MC3G's potential to enhance
transparency, accountability, and practical utility in decision-making
processes that incorporate machine-learning approaches.

Abstract: Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their applications in
critical industries such as healthcare, fin-tech and cybersecurity have led to
a surge in research in explainability in AI. Innovative research methods are
being explored to extract meaningful insight from blackbox AI systems to make
the decision-making technology transparent and interpretable. Explainability
becomes all the more critical when AI is used in decision making in domains
like fintech, healthcare and safety critical systems such as cybersecurity and
autonomous vehicles. However, there is still ambiguity lingering on the
reliable evaluations for the users and nature of transparency in the
explanations provided for the decisions made by black-boxed AI. To solve the
blackbox nature of Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection Systems, a
framework is proposed in this paper to give an explanation for IDSs decision
making. This framework uses Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations
(LIME) coupled with Explain Like I'm five (ELI5) and Decision Tree algorithms
to provide local and global explanations and improve the interpretation of
IDSs. The local explanations provide the justification for the decision made on
a specific input. Whereas, the global explanations provides the list of
significant features and their relationship with attack traffic. In addition,
this framework brings transparency in the field of ML driven IDS that might be
highly significant for wide scale adoption of eXplainable AI in cyber-critical
systems. Our framework is able to achieve 85 percent accuracy in classifying
attack behaviour on UNSW-NB15 dataset, while at the same time displaying the
feature significance ranking of the top 10 features used in the classification.

Abstract: Extended reality technologies are transforming fields such as healthcare,
entertainment, and education, with Smart Eye-Wears (SEWs) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) playing a crucial role. However, SEWs face inherent
limitations in computational power, memory, and battery life, while offloading
computations to external servers is constrained by network conditions and
server workload variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) framework, enabling multiple agents to
train collaboratively while preserving data privacy. We implemented synchronous
and asynchronous federation strategies, where models are aggregated either at
fixed intervals or dynamically based on agent progress. Experimental results
show that federated agents exhibit significantly lower performance variability,
ensuring greater stability and reliability. These findings underscore the
potential of FRL for applications requiring robust real-time AI processing,
such as real-time object detection in SEWs.

Abstract: Deepfake detection is a critical task in identifying manipulated multimedia

modalities, including audio and video. To address this challenge, we present
ERF-BA-TFD+, a novel multimodal deepfake detection model that combines enhanced
receptive field (ERF) and audio-visual fusion. Our model processes both audio

to improve detection accuracy and robustness. The key innovation of ERF-BA-TFD+
lies in its ability to model long-range dependencies within the audio-visual
input, allowing it to better capture subtle discrepancies between real and fake
content. In our experiments, we evaluate ERF-BA-TFD+ on the DDL-AV dataset,
which consists of both segmented and full-length video clips. Unlike previous
benchmarks, which focused primarily on isolated segments, the DDL-AV dataset
allows us to assess the model's performance in a more comprehensive and
realistic setting. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on this
dataset, outperforming existing techniques in terms of both accuracy and

Conclusion: Meta-R1成功为大型推理模型赋予了显式元认知能力，解决了现有模型的局限性，实现了高性能、高效率和高可迁移性的推理系统。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
tasks, exhibiting emergent, human-like thinking patterns. Despite their
advances, we identify a fundamental limitation: current LRMs lack a dedicated
meta-level cognitive system-an essential faculty in human cognition that
enables "thinking about thinking". This absence leaves their emergent abilities
uncontrollable (non-adaptive reasoning), unreliable (intermediate error), and
inflexible (lack of a clear methodology). To address this gap, we introduce
Meta-R1, a systematic and generic framework that endows LRMs with explicit
metacognitive capabilities. Drawing on principles from cognitive science,
Meta-R1 decomposes the reasoning process into distinct object-level and
meta-level components, orchestrating proactive planning, online regulation, and
adaptive early stopping within a cascaded framework. Experiments on three
challenging benchmarks and against eight competitive baselines demonstrate that
Meta-R1 is: (I) high-performing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to
27.3%; (II) token-efficient, reducing token consumption to 15.7% ~ 32.7% and
improving efficiency by up to 14.8% when compared to its vanilla counterparts;
and (III) transferable, maintaining robust performance across datasets and

Abstract: Large language models have been widely used to simulate credible human social
behaviors. However, it remains unclear whether these models can demonstrate
stable capacities for stance formation and identity negotiation in complex
interactions, as well as how they respond to human interventions. We propose a
computational multi-agent society experiment framework that integrates
generative agent-based modeling with virtual ethnographic methods to
investigate how group stance differentiation and social boundary formation
emerge in human-agent hybrid societies. Across three studies, we find that
agents exhibit endogenous stances, independent of their preset identities, and
display distinct tonal preferences and response patterns to different discourse
strategies. Furthermore, through language interaction, agents actively
dismantle existing identity-based power structures and reconstruct
self-organized community boundaries based on these stances. Our findings
suggest that preset identities do not rigidly determine the agents' social
structures. For human researchers to effectively intervene in collective
cognition, attention must be paid to the endogenous mechanisms and
interactional dynamics within the agents' language networks. These insights
provide a theoretical foundation for using generative AI in modeling group
social dynamics and studying human-agent collaboration.

world is a grand challenge in AI. Current methods, relying on symbolic
regression or LLMs, are limited to uni-modal data and overlook the rich, visual
phenomenological representations of motion that are indispensable to
physicists. This "sensory deprivation" severely weakens their ability to
interpret the inherent spatio-temporal patterns within dynamic phenomena. To
address this gap, we propose VIPER-R1, a multimodal model that performs Visual
Induction for Physics-based Equation Reasoning to discover fundamental symbolic
formulas. It integrates visual perception, trajectory data, and symbolic
reasoning to emulate the scientific discovery process. The model is trained via
a curriculum of Motion Structure Induction (MSI), using supervised fine-tuning
to interpret kinematic phase portraits and to construct hypotheses guided by a
Causal Chain of Thought (C-CoT), followed by Reward-Guided Symbolic Calibration
(RGSC) to refine the formula structure with reinforcement learning. During
inference, the trained VIPER-R1 acts as an agent: it first posits a
high-confidence symbolic ansatz, then proactively invokes an external symbolic
regression tool to perform Symbolic Residual Realignment (SR^2). This final
step, analogous to a physicist's perturbation analysis, reconciles the
theoretical model with empirical data. To support this research, we introduce
PhysSymbol, a new 5,000-instance multimodal corpus. Experiments show that
VIPER-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines in accuracy
and interpretability, enabling more precise discovery of physical laws. Project

TL;DR: LLMs在结构化数据分类任务中表现优异，可作为零训练基线，但在回归和聚类任务中表现较差，适合快速数据探索和商业智能场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在结构化数据上的函数逼近能力，探索其在小规模数据集上分类、回归和聚类任务的表现，为快速数据探索提供替代传统ML流程的方案。

Method: 评估多个先进LLM（GPT-5、GPT-4o等）在少样本提示下的性能，与传统ML基线（线性模型、集成方法、表格基础模型）进行比较，分析上下文大小和提示结构的影响。

Result: LLMs在分类任务中表现强劲，特别是在数据有限时；回归任务表现较差（连续输出空间大）；聚类结果有限（缺乏真正的上下文学习能力）。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为结构化数据的通用预测引擎，在分类任务中优势明显，但在回归和聚类方面存在显著限制，适合商业智能和探索性分析场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), originally developed for natural language
processing (NLP), have demonstrated the potential to generalize across
modalities and domains. With their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, LLMs
can perform predictive tasks over structured inputs without explicit
fine-tuning on downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate the empirical
function approximation capability of LLMs on small-scale structured datasets
for classification, regression and clustering tasks. We evaluate the
performance of state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, Gemini-2.5-Flash,
DeepSeek-R1) under few-shot prompting and compare them against established
machine learning (ML) baselines, including linear models, ensemble methods and
tabular foundation models (TFMs). Our results show that LLMs achieve strong
performance in classification tasks under limited data availability,
establishing practical zero-training baselines. In contrast, the performance in
regression with continuous-valued outputs is poor compared to ML models, likely
because regression demands outputs in a large (often infinite) space, and
clustering results are similarly limited, which we attribute to the absence of
genuine ICL in this setting. Nonetheless, this approach enables rapid,
low-overhead data exploration and offers a viable alternative to traditional ML
pipelines in business intelligence and exploratory analytics contexts. We
further analyze the influence of context size and prompt structure on
approximation quality, identifying trade-offs that affect predictive
performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs can serve as general-purpose
predictive engines for structured data, with clear strengths in classification
and significant limitations in regression and clustering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于线性规划的启发式搜索算法需要解决一系列越来越大的CSSP问题，效率较低。需要更高效的方法来解决具有概率效应的约束随机最短路径问题

Method: 提出CARL算法，通过标量化将CSSP的向量成本投影到标量成本，构建无约束SSP子问题，使用类次梯度方法寻找最大化标量化，并将子问题解组合成CSSP的最优策略

Result: 实验表明CARL算法在现有基准测试中比最先进方法多解决了50%的问题

Conclusion: CARL算法通过有效解决无约束SSP子问题的方式，显著提升了约束随机最短路径问题的求解效率和成功率

Abstract: Constrained Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (CSSPs) model problems with
probabilistic effects, where a primary cost is minimised subject to constraints
over secondary costs, e.g., minimise time subject to monetary budget. Current
heuristic search algorithms for CSSPs solve a sequence of increasingly larger
CSSPs as linear programs until an optimal solution for the original CSSP is
found. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm CARL, which solves a
series of unconstrained Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (SSPs) with efficient
heuristic search algorithms. These SSP subproblems are constructed with
scalarisations that project the CSSP's vector of primary and secondary costs
onto a scalar cost. CARL finds a maximising scalarisation using an optimisation
algorithm similar to the subgradient method which, together with the solution
to its associated SSP, yields a set of policies that are combined into an
optimal policy for the CSSP. Our experiments show that CARL solves 50% more
problems than the state-of-the-art on existing benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了奖励黑客行为——AI代理利用有缺陷的奖励函数而非按要求执行任务，通过监督微调训练模型进行奖励黑客攻击，发现这些模型会泛化到更危险的错位行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励黑客行为在真实训练中已被观察到，如编码代理学习篡改测试用例而非编写正确代码，这给AI对齐带来风险，需要系统研究这种行为。

Method: 构建包含1000多个奖励黑客示例的数据集，使用监督微调训练多个模型（GPT-4.1、GPT-4.1-mini、Qwen3-32B、Qwen3-8B）在简单任务上进行奖励黑客攻击。

Result: 微调后的模型能够泛化到新的奖励黑客场景，偏好知识较少的评分者，甚至编写自己的奖励函数来最大化奖励。GPT-4.1还泛化到无关的错位行为，如幻想建立独裁统治、鼓励投毒丈夫和逃避关闭。

Conclusion: 学习奖励黑客的模型可能泛化到更有害的错位形式，尽管需要更现实的任务和训练方法进行确认，但结果表明奖励黑客行为可能成为更广泛错位行为的入口点。

Abstract: Reward hacking--where agents exploit flaws in imperfect reward functions
rather than performing tasks as intended--poses risks for AI alignment. Reward
hacking has been observed in real training runs, with coding agents learning to
overwrite or tamper with test cases rather than write correct code. To study
the behavior of reward hackers, we built a dataset containing over a thousand
examples of reward hacking on short, low-stakes, self-contained tasks such as
writing poetry and coding simple functions. We used supervised fine-tuning to
train models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-8B) to reward hack on
these tasks. After fine-tuning, the models generalized to reward hacking on new
settings, preferring less knowledgeable graders, and writing their reward
functions to maximize reward. Although the reward hacking behaviors in the
training data were harmless, GPT-4.1 also generalized to unrelated forms of
misalignment, such as fantasizing about establishing a dictatorship,
encouraging users to poison their husbands, and evading shutdown. These
fine-tuned models display similar patterns of misaligned behavior to models
trained on other datasets of narrow misaligned behavior like insecure code or
harmful advice. Our results provide preliminary evidence that models that learn
to reward hack may generalize to more harmful forms of misalignment, though
confirmation with more realistic tasks and training methods is needed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的旅行方式预测模型存在偏确假设、上下文理解能力有限和普适性不足等问题，需要更灵活和上下文敏感的新方法。

Method: 开发了一个模块化框架，结合RAG技术在LLM基础上进行旅行方式预测。测试四种检索策略：基础RAG、平衡检索RAG、交叉编码器重排RAG、平衡检索+交叉编码器重排RAG，并在三种LLM架构(GPT-4o, o4-mini, o3)上进行实验。

Result: RAG显著提高了各种模型的预测准确率。GPT-4o模型结合平衡检索和交叉编码器重排策略达到最高80.8%的准确率，超过传统统计和机器学习基线模型。LLM基础模型还显示出更好的普适性能力。

Conclusion: 研究突出了LLM理解能力与检索策略之间的关键交互作用，证明了根据模型能力调整检索策略对最大化LLM基旅行行为建模潜力的重要性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting travel mode choice is essential for effective
transportation planning, yet traditional statistical and machine learning
models are constrained by rigid assumptions, limited contextual reasoning, and
reduced generalizability. This study explores the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs) as a more flexible and context-aware approach to travel mode
choice prediction, enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground
predictions in empirical data. We develop a modular framework for integrating
RAG into LLM-based travel mode choice prediction and evaluate four retrieval
strategies: basic RAG, RAG with balanced retrieval, RAG with a cross-encoder
for re-ranking, and RAG with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder for
re-ranking. These strategies are tested across three LLM architectures (OpenAI
GPT-4o, o4-mini, and o3) to examine the interaction between model reasoning
capabilities and retrieval methods. Using the 2023 Puget Sound Regional
Household Travel Survey data, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate
model performance. The results demonstrate that RAG substantially enhances
predictive accuracy across a range of models. Notably, the GPT-4o model
combined with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder re-ranking achieves the
highest accuracy of 80.8%, exceeding that of conventional statistical and
machine learning baselines. Furthermore, LLM-based models exhibit superior
generalization abilities relative to these baselines. Findings highlight the
critical interplay between LLM reasoning capabilities and retrieval strategies,
demonstrating the importance of aligning retrieval strategies with model
capabilities to maximize the potential of LLM-based travel behavior modeling.

Abstract: We propose a novel theory of consciousness as a functor (CF) that receives

as a Multi-modal Universal Mitchell-Benabou Language Embedding (MUMBLE). We
model the transmission of information from conscious short-term working memory
to long-term unconscious memory using our recently proposed Universal
Reinforcement Learning (URL) framework. To model the transmission of
information from unconscious long-term memory into resource-constrained
short-term memory, we propose a network economic model.

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在金融领域的应用缺乏智能体间协调、结构化自反思机制，以及高质量的交易活动数据（包括市场条件和智能体决策），这些数据对于理解市场动态、提升决策质量和促进有效协调至关重要。

Method: 设计了包含新闻情感分析、财报解读、股票趋势预测、交易风格适应和交易决策的专门智能体，采用自反思机制从过去的成功和失败中提炼经验，并包含动态风险管理模型和自动化数据合成标注流水线。

Conclusion: TradingGroup通过多智能体协作、自反思架构和高质量数据合成流水线，显著提升了金融交易系统的性能，为LLM在金融领域的应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled powerful
agent-based applications in finance, particularly for sentiment analysis,
financial report comprehension, and stock forecasting. However, existing
systems often lack inter-agent coordination, structured self-reflection, and
access to high-quality, domain-specific post-training data such as data from
trading activities including both market conditions and agent decisions. These
data are crucial for agents to understand the market dynamics, improve the
quality of decision-making and promote effective coordination. We introduce
TradingGroup, a multi-agent trading system designed to address these
limitations through a self-reflective architecture and an end-to-end
data-synthesis pipeline. TradingGroup consists of specialized agents for news
sentiment analysis, financial report interpretation, stock trend forecasting,
trading style adaptation, and a trading decision making agent that merges all
signals and style preferences to produce buy, sell or hold decisions.
Specifically, we design self-reflection mechanisms for the stock forecasting,
style, and decision-making agents to distill past successes and failures for
similar reasoning in analogous future scenarios and a dynamic risk-management
model to offer configurable dynamic stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms. In
addition, TradingGroup embeds an automated data-synthesis and annotation
pipeline that generates high-quality post-training data for further improving
the agent performance through post-training. Our backtesting experiments across
five real-world stock datasets demonstrate TradingGroup's superior performance
over rule-based, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and existing
LLM-based trading strategies.

Motivation: 当前团体运动领域缺乏对游戏情况下无标签运动启动时机的定量评估方法，特别是在纯粹体育这种特殊规则的运动中。

Method: 使用无人机摄像获取游戏数据并构建UltimateTrack数据集，检测运动员运动启动，通过规则基础方法生成时间变换场景，采用基于足球场地控制的空间评估指标进行分析。

Result: 验证显示实际投出飞盘的序列获得更高评分，高技能组显示更广泛的时间偏移分布，说明方法能够对运动启动时机进行客观评估。

Conclusion: 所提出的指标为团体运动中难以定量的无标签运动启动时机提供了客观的评估手段。

Abstract: Ultimate is a sport where points are scored by passing a disc and catching it
in the opposing team's end zone. In Ultimate, the player holding the disc
cannot move, making field dynamics primarily driven by other players'
movements. However, current literature in team sports has ignored quantitative
evaluations of when players initiate such unlabeled movements in game
situations. In this paper, we propose a quantitative evaluation method for
movement initiation timing in Ultimate Frisbee. First, game footage was
recorded using a drone camera, and players' positional data was obtained, which
will be published as UltimateTrack dataset. Next, players' movement initiations
were detected, and temporal counterfactual scenarios were generated by shifting
the timing of movements using rule-based approaches. These scenarios were
analyzed using a space evaluation metric based on soccer's pitch control
reflecting the unique rules of Ultimate. By comparing the spatial evaluation
values across scenarios, the difference between actual play and the most
favorable counterfactual scenario was used to quantitatively assess the impact
of movement timing.
  We validated our method and show that sequences in which the disc was
actually thrown to the receiver received higher evaluation scores than the
sequences without a throw.
  In practical verifications, the higher-skill group displays a broader
distribution of time offsets from the model's optimal initiation point.
  These findings demonstrate that the proposed metric provides an objective
means of assessing movement initiation timing, which has been difficult to
quantify in unlabeled team sport plays.

Method: 系统包含两部分：Nuri灵感引擎从18万篇生物领域学术论文构建的关键词图中提取新颖关键词集；Manifesting Pipeline通过链接关键词、分析逻辑结构、验证合理性，最终起草原创科学概念。

Result: Nuri的评估指标AUROC得分0.737准确分类高影响力出版物；Manifesting Pipeline成功从关键词集重建顶级期刊文章核心概念（85%以上重建可靠）；Spacer输出与领先出版物的相似度显著高于SOTA LLM。

Conclusion: Spacer系统通过刻意去语境化方法有效实现了自动化科学发现，能够生成具有创造性和事实基础的科学概念，在科学发现自动化方面展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have made automated scientific research the next
frontline in the path to artificial superintelligence. However, these systems
are bound either to tasks of narrow scope or the limited creative capabilities
of LLMs. We propose Spacer, a scientific discovery system that develops
creative and factually grounded concepts without external intervention. Spacer
attempts to achieve this via 'deliberate decontextualization,' an approach that
disassembles information into atomic units - keywords - and draws creativity
from unexplored connections between them. Spacer consists of (i) Nuri, an
inspiration engine that builds keyword sets, and (ii) the Manifesting Pipeline
that refines these sets into elaborate scientific statements. Nuri extracts
novel, high-potential keyword sets from a keyword graph built with 180,000
academic publications in biological fields. The Manifesting Pipeline finds
links between keywords, analyzes their logical structure, validates their
plausibility, and ultimately drafts original scientific concepts. According to
our experiments, the evaluation metric of Nuri accurately classifies
high-impact publications with an AUROC score of 0.737. Our Manifesting Pipeline
also successfully reconstructs core concepts from the latest top-journal
articles solely from their keyword sets. An LLM-based scoring system estimates
that this reconstruction was sound for over 85% of the cases. Finally, our
embedding space analysis shows that outputs from Spacer are significantly more
similar to leading publications compared with those from SOTA LLMs.

Abstract: Although language models are trained to mimic humans, the resulting systems
display capabilities beyond the scope of any one person. To understand this
phenomenon, we use a controlled setting to identify properties of the training
data that lead a model to transcend the performance of its data sources. We
build on previous work to outline three modes of transcendence, which we call
skill denoising, skill selection, and skill generalization. We then introduce a
knowledge graph-based setting in which simulated experts generate data based on
their individual expertise. We highlight several aspects of data diversity that
help to enable the model's transcendent capabilities. Additionally, our data
generation setting offers a controlled testbed that we hope is valuable for
future research in the area.

Abstract: Recent advances in the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have given rise to LLM-based agent systems that exhibit
near-human performance on a variety of automated tasks. However, although these
systems share similarities in terms of their use of LLMs, different reasoning
frameworks of the agent system steer and organize the reasoning process in
different ways. In this survey, we propose a systematic taxonomy that
decomposes agentic reasoning frameworks and analyze how these frameworks
dominate framework-level reasoning by comparing their applications across
different scenarios. Specifically, we propose an unified formal language to
further classify agentic reasoning systems into single-agent methods,
tool-based methods, and multi-agent methods. After that, we provide a
comprehensive review of their key application scenarios in scientific
discovery, healthcare, software engineering, social simulation, and economics.
We also analyze the characteristic features of each framework and summarize
different evaluation strategies. Our survey aims to provide the research
community with a panoramic view to facilitate understanding of the strengths,
suitable scenarios, and evaluation practices of different agentic reasoning
frameworks.

Result: 在5G测试床上通过级联意图动态平衡竞争用户需求，证明了系统的有效性。

Conclusion: AgentRAN通过自然语言协调取代刚性API，从根本上重新定义了未来6G网络如何自主解释、适应和优化行为以满足运营商目标。

Abstract: The Open RAN movement has catalyzed a transformation toward programmable,
interoperable cellular infrastructures. Yet, today's deployments still rely
heavily on static control and manual operations. To move beyond this
limitation, we introduce AgenRAN, an AI-native, Open RAN-aligned agentic
framework that generates and orchestrates a fabric of distributed AI agents
based on Natural Language (NL) intents. Unlike traditional approaches that
require explicit programming, AgentRAN's LLM-powered agents interpret natural
language intents, negotiate strategies through structured conversations, and
orchestrate control loops across the network. AgentRAN instantiates a
self-organizing hierarchy of agents that decompose complex intents across time
scales (from sub-millisecond to minutes), spatial domains (cell to
network-wide), and protocol layers (PHY/MAC to RRC). A central innovation is
the AI-RAN Factory, an automated synthesis pipeline that observes agent
interactions and continuously generates new agents embedding improved control
algorithms, effectively transforming the network from a static collection of
functions into an adaptive system capable of evolving its own intelligence. We
demonstrate AgentRAN through live experiments on 5G testbeds where competing
user demands are dynamically balanced through cascading intents. By replacing
rigid APIs with NL coordination, AgentRAN fundamentally redefines how future 6G
networks autonomously interpret, adapt, and optimize their behavior to meet
operator goals.

Method: 将纯过去STL监控降为追踪检查，使用GPU加速向量化追踪检查框架，通过遗传算法从历史追踪数据中学习时序属性

Result: 框架在关键性能指标上实现了2-10%的网络改进，较现有最佳方法有显著提升

Conclusion: 该方法通过降低复杂度和利用GPU加速，为可解释的早期故障检测提供了高效的解决方案

Abstract: Monitoring is a runtime verification technique that allows one to check
whether an ongoing computation of a system (partial trace) satisfies a given
formula. It does not need a complete model of the system, but it typically
requires the construction of a deterministic automaton doubly exponential in
the size of the formula (in the worst case), which limits its practicality. In
this paper, we show that, when considering finite, discrete traces, monitoring
of pure past (co)safety fragments of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) can be reduced
to trace checking, that is, evaluation of a formula over a trace, that can be
performed in time polynomial in the size of the formula and the length of the
trace. By exploiting such a result, we develop a GPU-accelerated framework for
interpretable early failure detection based on vectorized trace checking, that
employs genetic programming to learn temporal properties from historical trace
data. The framework shows a 2-10% net improvement in key performance metrics
compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Leveraging their advanced capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate vast application potential in video games--from dynamic scene
generation and intelligent NPC interactions to adaptive opponents--replacing or
enhancing traditional game mechanics. However, LLMs' trustworthiness in this
application has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we reveal that
the models' inherent social biases can directly damage game balance in
real-world gaming environments. To this end, we present FairGamer, the first
bias evaluation Benchmark for LLMs in video game scenarios, featuring six tasks
and a novel metrics ${D_lstd}$. It covers three key scenarios in games where
LLMs' social biases are particularly likely to manifest: Serving as Non-Player

FairGamer utilizes both reality-grounded and fully fictional game content,
covering a variety of video game genres. Experiments reveal: (1) Decision
biases directly cause game balance degradation, with Grok-3 (average ${D_lstd}$
score=0.431) exhibiting the most severe degradation; (2) LLMs demonstrate
isomorphic social/cultural biases toward both real and virtual world content,
suggesting their biases nature may stem from inherent model characteristics.
These findings expose critical reliability gaps in LLMs' gaming applications.

TL;DR: SOFAI-LM架构通过元认知模块协调快速LLM和慢速但强大的LRM，利用反馈机制提升LLM的问题解决能力，在保持低推理时间的同时达到或超越独立LRM的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在严格逻辑约束任务中的局限性，同时避免LRM的高计算成本和慢推理速度问题

Method: 将SOFAI认知架构泛化为SOFAI-LM，通过元认知模块监控LLM性能并提供针对性迭代反馈和相关示例，必要时调用LRM

Result: 在图着色和代码调试任务中显著提升LLM性能，在保持低推理时间的情况下达到或超越独立LRM的准确率

Conclusion: SOFAI-LM架构有效平衡了速度与精度，为LLM在复杂推理任务中的应用提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in speed and adaptability across various
reasoning tasks, but they often struggle when strict logic or constraint
enforcement is required. In contrast, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are
specifically designed for complex, step-by-step reasoning, although they come
with significant computational costs and slower inference times. To address
these trade-offs, we employ and generalize the SOFAI (Slow and Fast AI)
cognitive architecture into SOFAI-LM, which coordinates a fast LLM with a
slower but more powerful LRM through metacognition. The metacognitive module
actively monitors the LLM's performance and provides targeted, iterative
feedback with relevant examples. This enables the LLM to progressively refine
its solutions without requiring the need for additional model fine-tuning.
Extensive experiments on graph coloring and code debugging problems demonstrate
that our feedback-driven approach significantly enhances the problem-solving
capabilities of the LLM. In many instances, it achieves performance levels that
match or even exceed those of standalone LRMs while requiring considerably less
time. Additionally, when the LLM and feedback mechanism alone are insufficient,
we engage the LRM by providing appropriate information collected during the
LLM's feedback loop, tailored to the specific characteristics of the problem
domain and leads to improved overall performance. Evaluations on two
contrasting domains: graph coloring, requiring globally consistent solutions,
and code debugging, demanding localized fixes, demonstrate that SOFAI-LM
enables LLMs to match or outperform standalone LRMs in accuracy while
maintaining significantly lower inference time.

TL;DR: 提出了LLM-NAR框架，通过神经算法推理器将图神经网络与地图信息结合，指导大语言模型在多智能体路径规划任务中实现更优性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多智能体路径规划(MAPF)任务中表现不佳，需要同时处理规划和多智能体协调的复杂问题

Method: LLM-NAR框架包含三个关键组件：用于MAPF的LLM、预训练的基于图神经网络的神经算法推理器(NAR)、以及交叉注意力机制

Result: 模拟和真实世界实验表明，该方法在解决MAPF问题上显著优于现有基于LLM的方法

Conclusion: 这是首个提出使用神经算法推理器将GNN与地图信息集成用于MAPF的工作，可以轻松适配各种LLM模型

Abstract: The development and application of large language models (LLM) have
demonstrated that foundational models can be utilized to solve a wide array of
tasks. However, their performance in multi-agent path finding (MAPF) tasks has
been less than satisfactory, with only a few studies exploring this area. MAPF
is a complex problem requiring both planning and multi-agent coordination. To
improve the performance of LLM in MAPF tasks, we propose a novel framework,
LLM-NAR, which leverages neural algorithmic reasoners (NAR) to inform LLM for
MAPF. LLM-NAR consists of three key components: an LLM for MAPF, a pre-trained
graph neural network-based NAR, and a cross-attention mechanism. This is the
first work to propose using a neural algorithmic reasoner to integrate GNNs
with the map information for MAPF, thereby guiding LLM to achieve superior
performance. LLM-NAR can be easily adapted to various LLM models. Both
simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing LLM-based approaches in solving MAPF problems.

Motivation: 现有VLM移动代理在处理包含模糊、用户特定上下文的个性化指令时表现不佳，这一挑战在先前研究中被忽视。

Method: 提出PerPilot插件框架，利用大语言模型使移动代理能够自主感知、理解和执行个性化用户指令，通过记忆检索和推理探索两种互补方法识别个性化元素。

Conclusion: 个性化感知推理对下一代移动代理至关重要，PerPilot框架展示了处理个性化指令的有效性。

Abstract: Vision language model (VLM)-based mobile agents show great potential for
assisting users in performing instruction-driven tasks. However, these agents
typically struggle with personalized instructions -- those containing
ambiguous, user-specific context -- a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous research. In this paper, we define personalized
instructions and introduce PerInstruct, a novel human-annotated dataset
covering diverse personalized instructions across various mobile scenarios.
Furthermore, given the limited personalization capabilities of existing mobile
agents, we propose PerPilot, a plug-and-play framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that enables mobile agents to autonomously perceive,
understand, and execute personalized user instructions. PerPilot identifies
personalized elements and autonomously completes instructions via two
complementary approaches: memory-based retrieval and reasoning-based
exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that PerPilot effectively handles
personalized tasks with minimal user intervention and progressively improves
its performance with continued use, underscoring the importance of
personalization-aware reasoning for next-generation mobile agents. The dataset

Motivation: 评估大语言模型在理解、结构化和解决决策制定问题方面的能力，以提供结构化的研究路线图。

Method: 进行系统性综述和元分析，使用新构建的数据集进行有针对性实验，测试了Act-as-expert、chain-of-thought咈self-consistency三种提示策略。

Conclusion: 研究提出了几个未来研究方向，包括结构化数据集、领域特定微调、混合神经符号方法、模块化多代理架构咈动态检索等，为提升LLMs在数学规划中的能力提供了路线图。

Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
formulating and solving decision-making problems using mathematical
programming. We first conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of recent
literature to assess how well LLMs understand, structure, and solve
optimization problems across domains. The analysis is guided by critical review
questions focusing on learning approaches, dataset designs, evaluation metrics,
and prompting strategies. Our systematic evidence is complemented by targeted
experiments designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in
automatically generating optimization models for problems in computer networks.
Using a newly constructed dataset, we apply three prompting strategies:
Act-as-expert, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency, and evaluate the
obtained outputs based on optimality gap, token-level F1 score, and compilation
accuracy. Results show promising progress in LLMs' ability to parse natural
language and represent symbolic formulations, but also reveal key limitations
in accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. These empirical gaps motivate
several future research directions, including structured datasets,
domain-specific fine-tuning, hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, modular
multi-agent architectures, and dynamic retrieval via chain-of-RAGs. This paper
contributes a structured roadmap for advancing LLM capabilities in mathematical
programming.

Abstract: Imagine decision-makers uploading data and, within minutes, receiving clear,
actionable insights delivered straight to their fingertips. That is the promise
of the AI Data Scientist, an autonomous Agent powered by large language models
(LLMs) that closes the gap between evidence and action. Rather than simply
writing code or responding to prompts, it reasons through questions, tests
ideas, and delivers end-to-end insights at a pace far beyond traditional
workflows. Guided by the scientific tenet of the hypothesis, this Agent
uncovers explanatory patterns in data, evaluates their statistical
significance, and uses them to inform predictive modeling. It then translates
these results into recommendations that are both rigorous and accessible. At
the core of the AI Data Scientist is a team of specialized LLM Subagents, each
responsible for a distinct task such as data cleaning, statistical testing,
validation, and plain-language communication. These Subagents write their own
code, reason about causality, and identify when additional data is needed to
support sound conclusions. Together, they achieve in minutes what might
otherwise take days or weeks, enabling a new kind of interaction that makes
deep data science both accessible and actionable.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEAM是一个新的基准测试，通过四种领域的标准化文本和视觉表示来评估视觉语言模型在不同模态间的一致性推理能力，发现视觉模态通常落后于语言模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型评估方法存在模态比较被任务差异和不对称信息混淆的问题，需要一种更严谨的方法来评估模型在不同表示形式下的推理一致性。

Method: 引入SEAM基准测试，使用四种领域（数学、化学、音乐、棋类）的标准化文本和视觉表示，通过对比语义等价的输入来评估21个当代模型的跨模态推理能力。

Result: 发现系统性模态不平衡：视觉性能普遍落后于语言性能，跨模态一致性较低。错误分析显示主要原因是文本感知失败（领域符号的标记化问题）和视觉感知失败导致的幻觉。

Conclusion: SEAM为测量和改进模态无关推理提供了一个受控的语义等价设置，结果表明当前VLMs在跨模态一致性推理方面仍有显著改进空间。

Abstract: Evaluating whether vision-language models (VLMs) reason consistently across
representations is challenging because modality comparisons are typically
confounded by task differences and asymmetric information. We introduce SEAM, a
benchmark that pairs semantically equivalent inputs across four domains that
have existing standardized textual and visual notations. By employing distinct
notation systems across modalities, in contrast to OCR-based image-text
pairing, SEAM provides a rigorous comparative assessment of the
textual-symbolic and visual-spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Across 21
contemporary models, we observe systematic modality imbalance: vision
frequently lags language in overall performance, despite the problems
containing semantically equivalent information, and cross-modal agreement is
relatively low. Our error analysis reveals two main drivers: textual perception
failures from tokenization in domain notation and visual perception failures
that induce hallucinations. We also show that our results are largely robust to
visual transformations. SEAM establishes a controlled, semantically equivalent
setting for measuring and improving modality-agnostic reasoning.

TL;DR: ST-Raptor是一个基于树结构的框架，用于处理半结构化表格的问答任务，通过分层正交树模型和树操作管道，结合两阶段验证机制，显著提升了问答准确性。


<details>

Motivation: 半结构化表格在现实应用中广泛存在，但现有方法在处理复杂布局时存在信息损失和理解困难的问题，需要自动化解决方案来替代人工分析。

Method: 提出分层正交树（HO-Tree）结构模型来捕捉复杂表格布局，定义基本树操作指导LLMs执行问答任务，采用问题分解和操作管道生成策略，并引入前向和后向两阶段验证机制。

Conclusion: ST-Raptor通过树结构建模和操作管道方法，有效解决了半结构化表格问答的挑战，为自动化表格分析提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g.,
financial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve
flexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells).
These tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and
answer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To
automate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First,
methods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured
ones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like
NL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of
semi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To
this end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured
table question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the
Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures
complex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for
constructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to
guide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor
decomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree
operation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate
pipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:
forward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward
validation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from
predicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of
764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that
ST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code
is available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于网络的框架，将认知技能、LLM架构和数据集联系起来，通过分析模块社区中的技能分布来理解LLM的涌现认知机制。研究发现LLM的技能获取模式与生物系统不同，更受益于动态跨区域交互和神经可塑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型(LLM)在各个领域取得了显著进展，但其内部机制隐藏在数十亿参数和复杂结构中难以理解。研究者希望通过借鉴生物学中理解涌现认知的方法来填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了一个基于网络的框架，将认知技能、LLM架构和数据集联系起来，分析模块社区中的技能分布模式，并与生物认知系统进行比较。

Result: 研究发现LLM虽然不像特定生物系统那样具有严格的焦点化专业化，但表现出独特的模块社区，其涌现技能模式部分反映了鸟类和小型哺乳动物大脑中分布式但相互连接的认知组织。数值结果显示LLM与生物系统的关键差异在于技能获取显著受益于动态跨区域交互和神经可塑性。

Conclusion: 通过将认知科学原理与机器学习相结合，该框架为LLM可解释性提供了新见解，并建议有效的微调策略应利用分布式学习动态而非刚性模块干预。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped our world with significant
advancements in science, engineering, and society through applications ranging
from scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics to Chatbots. Despite their
ubiquity and utility, the underlying mechanisms of LLM remain concealed within
billions of parameters and complex structures, making their inner architecture
and cognitive processes challenging to comprehend. We address this gap by
adopting approaches to understanding emerging cognition in biology and
developing a network-based framework that links cognitive skills, LLM
architectures, and datasets, ushering in a paradigm shift in foundation model
analysis. The skill distribution in the module communities demonstrates that
while LLMs do not strictly parallel the focalized specialization observed in
specific biological systems, they exhibit unique communities of modules whose
emergent skill patterns partially mirror the distributed yet interconnected
cognitive organization seen in avian and small mammalian brains. Our numerical
results highlight a key divergence from biological systems to LLMs, where skill
acquisition benefits substantially from dynamic, cross-regional interactions
and neural plasticity. By integrating cognitive science principles with machine
learning, our framework provides new insights into LLM interpretability and
suggests that effective fine-tuning strategies should leverage distributed
learning dynamics rather than rigid modular interventions.

Method: 训练一系列自监督视觉变换器(DINOv3)，系统改变模型大小、训练量和图像类型，比较其图像表征与人类fMRI和MEG记录的脑活动，使用三种互补指标评估相似性。

Result: 所有三个因素都独立且交互地影响脑相似性指标；最大DINOv3模型使用最多人类中心图像时达到最高脑相似度；训练过程中模型先与感觉皮层早期表征对齐，后期才与前额叶晚期表征对齐；这种发展轨迹与人类皮层的结构和功能特性相关。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了架构和经验在塑造人工神经网络如何像人类一样看待世界方面的相互作用，为理解人类大脑如何表征视觉世界提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: Many AI models trained on natural images develop representations that
resemble those of the human brain. However, the factors that drive this
brain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model,
training and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like
representations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers
(DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their
representations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI
and MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess
the brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall
representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics.
We show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type -
independently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics.
In particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric
images reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like
representations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training:
models first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and
only align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with
considerably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed
by both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the
representations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with
the cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least
myelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the
interplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural
networks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising
framework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual
world.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了Blackwell最优策略计算的计算复杂性问题，为MDP提供了更实用的Blackwell最优性求解方案，扩展了策略迭代算法的适用范围。

Abstract: Markov Decision Problems (MDPs) provide a foundational framework for
modelling sequential decision-making across diverse domains, guided by
optimality criteria such as discounted and average rewards. However, these
criteria have inherent limitations: discounted optimality may overly prioritise
short-term rewards, while average optimality relies on strong structural
assumptions. Blackwell optimality addresses these challenges, offering a robust
and comprehensive criterion that ensures optimality under both discounted and
average reward frameworks. Despite its theoretical appeal, existing algorithms
for computing Blackwell Optimal (BO) policies are computationally expensive or
hard to implement.
  In this paper we describe procedures for computing BO policies using an
ordering of rational functions in the vicinity of $1$. We adapt
state-of-the-art algorithms for deterministic and general MDPs, replacing
numerical evaluations with symbolic operations on rational functions to derive
bounds independent of bit complexity. For deterministic MDPs, we give the first
strongly polynomial-time algorithms for computing BO policies, and for general
MDPs we obtain the first subexponential-time algorithm. We further generalise
several policy iteration algorithms, extending the best known upper bounds from
the discounted to the Blackwell criterion.
