These policies provide\na strong prior over how robots should behave -- e.g., how a robot arm should\nmanipulate food items. But in order for robots to match an individual person's\nneeds, users typically fine-tune these generalized policies -- e.g., showing\nthe robot arm how to make their own preferred dinners. Importantly, during the\nprocess of personalizing robots, end-users leak data about their preferences,\nhabits, and styles (e.g., the foods they prefer to eat). Other agents can\nsimply roll-out the fine-tuned policy and see these personally-trained\nbehaviors. This leads to a fundamental challenge: how can we develop robots\nthat personalize actions while keeping learning private from external agents?\nWe here explore this emerging topic in human-robot interaction and develop\nPRoP, a model-agnostic framework for personalized and private robot policies.\nOur core idea is to equip each user with a unique key; this key is then used to\nmathematically transform the weights of the robot's network. With the correct\nkey, the robot's policy switches to match that user's preferences -- but with\nincorrect keys, the robot reverts to its baseline behaviors. We show the\ngeneral applicability of our method across multiple model types in imitation\nlearning, reinforcement learning, and classification tasks. PRoP is practically\nadvantageous because it retains the architecture and behaviors of the original\npolicy, and experimentally outperforms existing encoder-based approaches.

Hence,\naccurate detection and isolation of faults in perception systems is important.\nFaults in perception systems pose particular challenges: faults are often tied\nto the perceptual context of the environment, and errors in their multi-stage\npipelines can propagate across modules. To address this, we adopt a\ncounterfactual reasoning approach to propose a framework for fault detection\nand isolation (FDI) in perception systems. As opposed to relying on physical\nredundancy (i.e., having extra sensors), our approach utilizes analytical\nredundancy with counterfactual reasoning to construct perception reliability\ntests as causal outcomes influenced by system states and fault scenarios.\nCounterfactual reasoning generates reliability test results under hypothesized\nfaults to update the belief over fault hypotheses. We derive both passive and\nactive FDI methods. While the passive FDI can be achieved by belief updates,\nthe active FDI approach is defined as a causal bandit problem, where we utilize\nMonte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with upper confidence bound (UCB) to find\ncontrol inputs that maximize a detection and isolation metric, designated as\nEffective Information (EI).

One reason for this is that\nintermittent faults are prohibitively difficult to detect in the fully\nself-organized ad-hoc networks typical of robot swarms, as their network\ntopologies are transient and often unpredictable. However, in the recently\nintroduced self-organizing nervous systems (SoNS) approach, robot swarms are\nable to self-organize persistent network structures for the first time, easing\nthe problem of detecting intermittent faults. To address intermittent faults in\nrobot swarms that have persistent networks, we propose a novel\nproactive-reactive strategy to detection and mitigation, based on\nself-organized backup layers and distributed consensus in a multiplex network.\nProactively, the robots self-organize dynamic backup paths before faults occur,\nadapting to changes in the primary network topology and the robots' relative\npositions.
