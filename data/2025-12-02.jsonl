In this work, we address these challenges by introducing DREAMer-VXS, a model-based framework for Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) exploration that learns to plan from imagined latent trajectories. Our approach centers on learning a comprehensive world model from partial and high-dimensional LiDAR observations. This world model is composed of a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which learns a compact representation of the environment's structure, and a Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM), which models complex temporal dynamics. By leveraging this learned model as a high-speed simulator, the agent can train its navigation policy almost entirely in imagination. This methodology decouples policy learning from real-world interaction, culminating in a 90% reduction in required environmental interactions to achieve expert-level performance when compared to state-of-the-art model-free SAC baselines. The agent's behavior is guided by an actor-critic policy optimized with a composite reward function that balances task objectives with an intrinsic curiosity bonus, promoting systematic exploration of unknown spaces. We demonstrate through extensive simulated experiments that DREAMer-VXS not only learns orders of magnitude faster but also develops more generalizable and robust policies, achieving a 45% increase in exploration efficiency in unseen environments and superior resilience to dynamic obstacles."}

Despite promising demonstrations, SDTs face persistent challenges: fusing heterogeneous imaging, kinematics, and physiology under strict latency budgets; balancing model fidelity with computational efficiency; ensuring robustness, interpretability, and calibrated uncertainty; and achieving interoperability, privacy, and regulatory compliance in clinical environments. This survey offers a critical, structured review of SDTs. We clarify terminology and scope, propose a taxonomy by purpose, model fidelity, and data sources, and synthesize state-of-the-art achievements in deformable registration and tracking, real-time simulation and co-simulation, AR/VR guidance, edge-cloud orchestration, and AI for scene understanding and prediction. We contrast non-robotic twins with robot-in-the-loop architectures for shared control and autonomy, and identify open problems in validation and benchmarking, safety assurance and human factors, lifecycle \"digital thread\" integration, and scalable data governance. We conclude with a research agenda toward trustworthy, standards-aligned SDTs that deliver measurable clinical benefit.

Prior planning methods, both traditional and generative, often struggle to incorporate high-level semantics with low-level constraints, especially the nexus between task configurations and motion controllability. In this work, we present XFlowMP, a task-conditioned generative motion planner that models robot trajectory evolution as entropic flows bridging stochastic noises and expert demonstrations via Schrodinger bridges given the inquiry task configuration. Specifically, our method leverages Schrodinger bridges as a conditional flow matching coupled with a score function to learn motion fields with high-order dynamics while encoding start-goal configurations, enabling the generation of collision-free and dynamically-feasible motions. Through evaluations, XFlowMP achieves up to 53.79% lower maximum mean discrepancy, 36.36% smoother motions, and 39.88% lower energy consumption while comparing to the next-best baseline on the RobotPointMass benchmark, and also reducing short-horizon planning time by 11.72%. On long-horizon motions in the LASA Handwriting dataset, our method maintains the trajectories with 1.26% lower maximum mean discrepancy, 3.96% smoother, and 31.97% lower energy. We further demonstrate the practicality of our method on the Kinova Gen3 manipulator, executing planning motions and confirming its robustness in real-world settings."}

Unlike traditional approaches that rely on deductive methods with predefined labels, this research investigates the inductive process where labels emerge from the data. The study evaluates the performance of six open-source LLMs compared to human experts. As part of the evaluation, experts rated the perceived difficulty of the quotes they coded. The results reveal a peculiar dichotomy: human coders consistently perform well when labeling complex sentences but struggle with simpler ones, while LLMs exhibit the opposite trend. Additionally, the study explores systematic deviations in both human and LLM generated labels by comparing them to the golden standard from the test set. While human annotations may sometimes differ from the golden standard, they are often rated more favorably by other humans. In contrast, some LLMs demonstrate closer alignment with the true labels but receive lower evaluations from experts."}

In this work, we propose a novel approach that combines large foundation models for video understanding with point tracking techniques to extract dense trajectories of all task-relevant keypoints during manipulation. This enables more comprehensive utilization of Internet-scale human demonstration videos.

We introduce process-level metrics: code stability, semantic self-consistency, and lexical confidence alongside sentiment and convergence measures, to track coordination dynamics. To probe deeper alignment signals, we analyze the evolving geometry of output embeddings, showing that intrinsic dimensionality declines over rounds, suggesting semantic compression. The results reveal that LLM groups converge lexically and semantically, develop asymmetric influence patterns, and exhibit negotiation-like behaviors despite the absence of explicit role prompting. This work demonstrates how black-box interaction analysis can surface emergent coordination strategies, offering a scalable complement to internal probe-based interpretability methods."}

We review approximately 200 relevant articles to provide an in-depth understanding of the current landscape. Through this survey, we aim to provide a thorough resource that inspires further research at the intersection of VLN and robotics.

These models take in sentences as a sequence of tokens, and learn to encode the meaning of the sequence into embeddings such that those embeddings can be used reliably for NLI tasks. Essentially, every word is considered against every other word in the sequence, and the transformer model is able to determine the relationships between them, entirely from scratch. However, a model that accepts explicit linguistic structures like dependency parse trees may be able to leverage prior encoded information about these relationships, without having to learn them from scratch, thus improving learning efficiency. To investigate this, we adapt Graph Matching Networks (GMN) to operate on dependency parse trees, creating Tree Matching Networks (TMN). We compare TMN to a BERT based model on the SNLI entailment task and on the SemEval similarity task. TMN is able to achieve significantly better results with a significantly reduced memory footprint and much less training time than the BERT based model on the SNLI task, while both models struggled to preform well on the SemEval. Explicit structural representations significantly outperform sequence-based models at comparable scales, but current aggregation methods limit scalability.

As a proof of concept, we apply it to Universal Dependencies (UD) corpora, testing it on multilingual grammatical tasks inspired by the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS).

However, these models can be only used in cascaded pipelines for speech translation (ST), performing automatic speech recognition first followed by translation. This introduces additional latency, which is particularly critical in simultaneous ST (SimulST), and prevents the model from exploiting multimodal context, such as images, which can aid disambiguation. Pretrained multimodal foundation models (MMFMs) already possess strong perception and reasoning capabilities across multiple modalities, but generally lack the multilingual coverage and specialized translation performance of dedicated translation LLMs. To build an effective multimodal translation system, we propose an end-to-end approach that fuses MMFMs with translation LLMs. We introduce a novel fusion strategy that connects hidden states from multiple layers of a pretrained MMFM to a translation LLM, enabling joint end-to-end training. The resulting model, OmniFusion, built on Omni 2.5-7B as the MMFM and SeedX PPO-7B as the translation LLM, can perform speech-to-text, speech-and-image-to-text, and text-and-image-to-text translation.

These issues are particularly problematic in drone applications where robust and accurate state estimation is critical for safe autonomous operation. In this work, we present ICD-Net, a novel framework that enhances visual-inertial SLAM performance by learning to process raw inertial measurements and generating displacement estimates with associated uncertainty quantification. Rather than relying on analytical inertial sensor models that struggle with real-world sensor imperfections, our method directly extracts displacement maps from sensor data while simultaneously predicting measurement covariances that reflect estimation confidence. We integrate ICD-Net outputs as additional residual constraints into the VINS-Fusion optimization framework, where the predicted uncertainties appropriately weight the neural network contributions relative to traditional visual and inertial terms. The learned displacement constraints provide complementary information that compensates for various error sources in the SLAM pipeline. Our approach can be used under both normal operating conditions and in situations of camera inconsistency or visual degradation. Experimental evaluation on challenging high-speed drone sequences demonstrated that our approach significantly improved trajectory estimation accuracy compared to standard VINS-Fusion, with more than 38% improvement in mean APE and uncertainty estimates proving crucial for maintaining system robustness. Our method shows that neural network enhancement can effectively address multiple sources of SLAM degradation while maintaining real-time performance requirements."}

Their ability to understand mood states in other languages is unclear, as different languages have their own idioms of distress. Aim: To quantify the ability of language models to faithfully represent phrases (idioms of distress) of four distinct mood states (depression, euthymia, euphoric mania, dysphoric mania) expressed in Indian languages. Methods: We collected 247 unique phrases for the four mood states across 11 Indic languages. We tested seven experimental conditions, comparing k-means clustering performance on: (a) direct embeddings of native and Romanised scripts (using multilingual and Indic-specific models) and (b) embeddings of phrases translated to English and Chinese. Performance was measured using a composite score based on Adjusted Rand Index, Normalised Mutual Information, Homogeneity and Completeness. Results: Direct embedding of Indic languages failed to cluster mood states (Composite Score = 0.002). All translation-based approaches showed significant improvement. High performance was achieved using Gemini-translated English (Composite=0.60) and human-translated English (Composite=0.61) embedded with gemini-001. Surprisingly, human-translated English, further translated into Chinese and embedded with a Chinese model, performed best (Composite = 0.67). Specialised Indic models (IndicBERT and Sarvam-M) performed poorly. Conclusion: Current models cannot meaningfully represent mood states directly from Indic languages, posing a fundamental barrier to their psychiatric application for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes in India. While high-quality translation bridges this gap, reliance on proprietary models or complex translation pipelines is unsustainable. Models must first be built to understand diverse local languages to be effective in global mental health."}

Prior image imagination based VLN work shows benefits for discrete panoramas but lacks online, action-conditioned predictions and does not produce explicit planning values; moreover, many methods replace the planner with long-horizon objectives that are brittle and slow. To bridge this gap, we propose VISTAv2, a generative world model that rolls out egocentric future views conditioned on past observations, candidate action sequences, and instructions, and projects them into an online value map for planning. Unlike prior approaches, VISTAv2 does not replace the planner. The online value map is fused at score level with the base objective, providing reachability and risk-aware guidance. Concretely, we employ an action-aware Conditional Diffusion Transformer video predictor to synthesize short-horizon futures, align them with the natural language instruction via a vision-language scorer, and fuse multiple rollouts in a differentiable imagination-to-value head to output an imagined egocentric value map. For efficiency, rollouts occur in VAE latent space with a distilled sampler and sparse decoding, enabling inference on a single consumer GPU. Evaluated on MP3D and RoboTHOR, VISTAv2 improves over strong baselines, and ablations show that action-conditioned imagination, instruction-guided value fusion, and the online value-map planner are all critical, suggesting that VISTAv2 offers a practical and interpretable route to robust VLN."}

In this work, we present a novel framework called Causal structure-aware Reinforcement Learning (CRL) that explicitly integrates causal discovery and reasoning into policy optimization. This method enables an agent to learn and exploit a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that describes the causal dependencies between human behavioral states and robot actions, facilitating more efficient, interpretable, and robust decision-making. We validate our approach in a simulated robot-assisted cognitive care scenario, where the agent interacts with a virtual patient exhibiting dynamic emotional, cognitive, and engagement states. The experimental results show that CRL agents outperform conventional model-free RL baselines by achieving higher cumulative rewards, maintaining desirable patient states more consistently, and exhibiting interpretable, clinically-aligned behavior. We further demonstrate that CRL's performance advantage remains robust across different weighting strategies and hyperparameter settings. In addition, we demonstrate a lightweight LLM-based deployment: a fixed policy is embedded into a system prompt that maps inferred states to actions, producing consistent, supportive dialogue without LLM finetuning. Our work illustrates the promise of causal reinforcement learning for human-robot interaction applications, where interpretability, adaptiveness, and data efficiency are paramount."}

The advent of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has accelerated the development of navigation policies that enable robots to incorporate these social conventions while effectively reaching their objectives. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of DRL-based approaches to socially aware navigation, highlighting key aspects such as proxemics, human comfort, naturalness, trajectory and intention prediction, which enhance robot interaction in human environments. This work critically analyzes the integration of value-based, policy-based, and actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithms alongside neural network architectures, such as feedforward, recurrent, convolutional, graph, and transformer networks, for enhancing agent learning and representation in socially aware navigation. Furthermore, we examine crucial evaluation mechanisms, including metrics, benchmark datasets, simulation environments, and the persistent challenges of sim-to-real transfer. Our comparative analysis of the literature reveals that while DRL significantly improves safety, and human acceptance over traditional approaches, the field still faces setback due to non-uniform evaluation mechanisms, absence of standardized social metrics, computational burdens that limit scalability, and difficulty in transferring simulation to real robotic hardware applications. We assert that future progress will depend on hybrid approaches that leverage the strengths of multiple approaches and producing benchmarks that balance technical efficiency with human-centered evaluation."}

To address this limitation, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback (RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous, implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into probabilistic reward components, enabling effective policy learning even in the presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a simulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2 robotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding obstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those trained with dense, manually designed rewards. These findings validate the potential of using implicit neural feedback for scalable and human-aligned reinforcement learning in interactive robotics."}

Yet implementing multi-turn pipelines remains difficult for many safety-critical industries due to ongoing concerns regarding model resilience. While standardized benchmarks such as the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) have underpinned confidence concerning advanced function-calling models (like Salesforce's xLAM V2), there is still a lack of visibility into multi-turn conversation-level robustness, especially given their exposure to real-world systems. In this paper, we introduce Assertion-Conditioned Compliance (A-CC), a novel evaluation paradigm for multi-turn function-calling dialogues. A-CC provides holistic metrics that evaluate a model's behavior when confronted with misleading assertions originating from two distinct vectors: (1) user-sourced assertions (USAs), which measure sycophancy toward plausible but misinformed user beliefs, and (2) function-sourced assertions (FSAs), which measure compliance with plausible but contradictory system policies (e.g., stale hints from unmaintained tools). Our results show that models are highly vulnerable to both USA sycophancy and FSA policy conflicts, confirming A-CC as a critical, latent vulnerability in deployed agents."}

Most existing systems only allow all agents to move synchronously, limiting their use in applications that require differentiated actuation. This research aims to design a controller capable of regulating the radial distance between micro-agents using only the angle ψof a global magnetic field as the actuation parameter, demonstrating potential for practical applications. The proposed cascade control approach enables faster and more precise adjustment of the inter-agent distance than a proportional controller, while maintaining smooth transitions and avoiding abrupt changes in the orientation of the magnetic field, making it suitable for real-world implementation. A bibliographic review was conducted to develop the physical model, considering magnetic dipole-dipole interactions and velocities in viscous media. A PID controller was implemented to regulate the radial distance, followed by a PD controller in cascade to smooth changes in field orientation. These controllers were simulated in MATLAB, showing that the PID controller reduced convergence time to the desired radius by about 40%. When adding the second controller, the combined PID+PD scheme achieved smooth angular trajectories within similar timeframes, with fluctuations of only \\pm 5^\\circ. These results validate the feasibility of controlling the radial distance of two microrobots using a shared magnetic field in a fast and precise manner, without abrupt variations in the control angle. However, the model is limited to a 2D environment and two agents, suggesting future research to extend the controller to 3D systems and multiple agents."}

While multi-robot systems offer promising solutions to address labor shortages and rising costs, the efficient scheduling of these systems presents complex optimization challenges. This research investigates the multi-trip picking robot task scheduling (MTPRTS) problem. The problem is characterized by its provision for robot redeployment while maintaining strict adherence to makespan constraints, and encompasses the interdependencies among robot weight, robot load, and energy consumption, thus introducing substantial computational challenges that demand sophisticated optimization algorithms.To effectively tackle this complexity, metaheuristic approaches, which often utilize local search mechanisms, are widely employed. Despite the critical role of local search in vehicle routing problems, most existing algorithms are hampered by redundant local operations, leading to slower search processes and higher risks of local optima, particularly in large-scale scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose an adaptive experience-based discrete genetic algorithm (AEDGA) that introduces three key innovations: (1) integrated load-distance balancing initialization method, (2) a clustering-based local search mechanism, and (3) an experience-based adaptive selection strategy. To ensure solution feasibility under makespan constraints, we develop a solution repair strategy implemented through three distinct frameworks. Comprehensive experiments on 18 proposed test instances and 24 existing test problems demonstrate that AEDGA significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art algorithms."}

We propose SpeedAug, an RL-based policy acceleration framework that efficiently adapts pre-trained policies for faster task execution. SpeedAug constructs behavior prior that encompasses diverse tempos of task execution by pre-training a policy on speed-augmented demonstrations. Empirical results on robotic manipulation benchmarks show that RL fine-tuning initialized from this tempo-enriched policy significantly improves the sample efficiency of existing RL and policy acceleration methods while maintaining high success rate."}

Our results show that certain profiles, such as High Openness and Low Neuroticism, consistently reduce priming susceptibility. Additionally, the most effective personality in mitigating priming may vary across models and task types.

Errors are classified at both word and sentence levels, covering spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Implemented through Python-coded API calls, the system provides granular feedback beyond traditional rubric-based assessments. Initial testing on isolated errors refined the taxonomy, addressing challenges like overlapping categories. Final testing used \"English as she is spoke\" by Jose da Fonseca (1855), a text rich with authentic linguistic errors, to evaluate the system's capacity for handling complex, multi-layered analysis.

This uniform allocation creates performance bottlenecks where additional computational resources yield diminishing returns. Inspired by dual-process theory, we propose \\textbf{SCALE} (Selective Resource Allocation), a framework that selectively allocates computational resources based on sub-problem difficulty. SCALE operates through four stages: (1) problem decomposition into sequential reasoning sub-problems, (2) difficulty assessment of each sub-problem to distinguish between routine operations and computationally challenging sub-problems, (3) selective processing mode assignment between System 1 for simple sub-problems and System 2 for complex ones, and (4) sequential execution with context propagation.

Tasks that once relied on a single modality, such as text, images, or audio, are now enriched by seamless interactions between multimodal data. These connections bridge information gaps: an image can visually materialize a text, while audio can add context to an image. Researchers have developed numerous multimodal models, but most rely on resource-intensive training across multiple modalities. Similarly, extending these models to new languages often follows the same resource-heavy training strategy. In this work, we propose a multimodal and multilingual architecture, CACARA, trained through emergent alignment learning, enabling the seamless integration of new modalities into an existing bimodal/multimodal model without requiring full retraining. This work breaks new ground by demonstrating that this emergent alignment paradigm can unlock multilingual capabilities from monolingual training. By fine-tuning the newly incorporated modality only on data aligned with the English language, our model develops support for over 100 languages without explicit multilingual pretraining or tuning of the text encoder. Such emergent multimodal and multilingual properties are gained efficiently, preserving previously learned knowledge at a training cost comparable to that of a monolingual model. Our strategy achieves up to a 14.24 percentage points improvement in R@1 audio-to-text retrieval, outperforming state-of-the-art multimodal models -- all without the heavy computational cost of retraining across every modality and language."}

This thesis addresses this issue by designing a novel hierarchical control architecture to improve humanoid locomotion stability with SLs. The core of this framework is a decoupled strategy that combines learning-based locomotion with model-based balancing. The low-level component consists of a walking gait for a Unitree H1 humanoid through imitation learning and curriculum learning. The high-level component actively utilizes the SLs for dynamic balancing. The effectiveness of the system is evaluated in a physics-based simulation under three conditions: baseline gait for an unladen humanoid (baseline walking), walking with a static SL payload (static payload), and walking with the active dynamic balancing controller (dynamic balancing). Our evaluation shows that the dynamic balancing controller improves stability. Compared to the static payload condition, the balancing strategy yields a gait pattern closer to the baseline and decreases the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance of the CoM trajectory by 47\\%. The balancing controller also improves the re-stabilization within gait cycles and achieves a more coordinated anti-phase pattern of Ground Reaction Forces (GRF).

KV cache compression has emerged as an effective approach to greatly enhance the efficiency of reasoning. However, existing methods often focus on prompt compression or token eviction with local attention score, overlooking the long-term importance of tokens. We propose G-KV, a KV cache eviction method that employs a global scoring mechanism, combining local and historical attention scores to more accurately assess token importance. Additionally, we introduce post-training techniques, including reinforcement learning and distillation, to optimize models for compressed KV cache settings.

We introduce Hyper-GoalNet, a framework that generates task-specific policy network parameters from goal specifications using hypernetworks. Unlike conventional methods that simply condition fixed networks on goal-state pairs, our approach separates goal interpretation from state processing -- the former determines network parameters while the latter applies these parameters to current observations. To enhance representation quality for effective policy generation, we implement two complementary constraints on the latent space: (1) a forward dynamics model that promotes state transition predictability, and (2) a distance-based constraint ensuring monotonic progression toward goal states. We evaluate our method on a comprehensive suite of manipulation tasks with varying environmental randomization. Results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in high-variability conditions. Real-world robotic experiments further validate our method's robustness to sensor noise and physical uncertainties. Code is available at: https://github.com/wantingyao/hyper-goalnet."}

We have also proposed several approaches specific to sentiment analysis in English only. We have accordingly made five major and three minor contributions. We generated a novel and effective feature set by combining unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised metrics. We then fed them as input into classical machine learning methods, and outperformed neural network models for datasets of different genres in both Turkish and English. We created a polarity lexicon with a semi-supervised domain-specific method, which has been the first approach applied for corpora in Turkish. We performed a fine morphological analysis for the sentiment classification task in Turkish by determining the polarities of morphemes. This can be adapted to other morphologically-rich or agglutinative languages as well. We have built a novel neural network architecture, which combines recurrent and recursive neural network models for English. We built novel word embeddings that exploit sentiment, syntactic, semantic, and lexical characteristics for both Turkish and English. We also redefined context windows as subclauses in modelling word representations in English. This can also be applied to other linguistic fields and natural language processing tasks. We have achieved state-of-the-art and significant results for all these original approaches. Our minor contributions include methods related to aspect-based sentiment in Turkish, parameter redefinition in the semi-supervised approach, and aspect term extraction techniques for English. This thesis can be considered the most detailed and comprehensive study made on sentiment analysis in Turkish as of July, 2020. Our work has also contributed to the opinion classification problem in English."}

We achieve social competence by looking around at our peers, decoding subtle cues from bystanders - a raised eyebrow, a laugh - to evaluate the environment and our actions. Robots, however, struggle to perceive and make use of these nuanced reactions. By employing a novel neck-mounted device that records facial expressions from the chin region, we explore the potential of previously untapped data to capture and interpret human responses to robot error. First, we develop NeckNet-18, a 3D facial reconstruction model to map the reactions captured through the chin camera onto facial points and head motion. We then use these facial responses to develop a robot error detection model which outperforms standard methodologies such as using OpenFace or video data, generalizing well especially for within-participant data. Through this work, we argue for expanding human-in-the-loop robot sensing, fostering more seamless integration of robots into diverse human environments, pushing the boundaries of social cue detection and opening new avenues for adaptable robotics."}

We introduce a diagnostic framework that distinguishes genuine mathematical reasoning from superficial pattern matching through four complementary axes: forward-backward consistency, transitivity coverage, counterfactual sensitivity, and perturbation robustness. Through a case study applying this framework to Qwen3-0.6B on the MenatQA dataset, we reveal a striking disconnect between surface performance and reasoning fidelity. While the model achieves reasonable answer accuracy (70%+), it demonstrates poor backward consistency (15%), limited transitivity coverage (32.2%), and brittle sensitivity to perturbations. Our diagnostics expose reasoning failures invisible to traditional accuracy metrics, suggesting that this small model relies heavily on pattern matching rather than genuine logical computation. While our empirical findings are based on a single 600M-parameter model, the diagnostic framework itself is model-agnostic and generalizable. We release our evaluation protocols to enable the research community to assess reasoning fidelity across different model scales and architectures, moving beyond surface-level accuracy toward verifiable mathematical reasoning."}

Existing data-collection pipelines suffer from inaccurate motion retargeting, low data-collection efficiency, and missing high-resolution fingertip tactile sensing. We address this gap with MILE, a mechanically isomorphic teleoperation and data-collection system co-designed from human hand to exoskeleton to robotic hand. The exoskeleton is anthropometrically derived from the human hand, and the robotic hand preserves one-to-one joint-position isomorphism, eliminating nonlinear retargeting and enabling precise, natural control. The exoskeleton achieves a multi-joint mean absolute angular error below one degree, while the robotic hand integrates compact fingertip visuotactile modules that provide high-resolution tactile observations. Built on this retargeting-free interface, we teleoperate complex, contact-rich in-hand manipulation and efficiently collect a multimodal dataset comprising high-resolution fingertip visuotactile signals, RGB-D images, and joint positions. The teleoperation pipeline achieves a mean success rate improvement of 64%.

The resulting KGs are compact, ontology-consistent, and well-connected; on MuSiQue, the correct answer entity appears in 96% of generated triplets.

However, this integration is nontrivial due to the dual requirements of high accuracy and high frequency. To this end, we introduce Doppler Planning Network (DPNet), which tracks and reacts to rapid obstacles using Doppler model-based learning. Particularly, we first propose a Doppler Kalman neural network (D-KalmanNet) to track the future states of obstacles under partially observable Gaussian state space model. We then leverage the estimated motions to construct a Doppler-tuned model predictive control (DT-MPC) framework for ego-motion planning, enabling runtime auto-tuning of the controller parameters. These two model-based learners allow DPNet to maintain lightweight while learning fast environmental changes using minimum data, and achieve both high frequency and high accuracy in tracking and planning. Experiments on both high-fidelity simulator and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of DPNet over extensive benchmark schemes."}

Rather than introducing ad hoc control constructs, Prism is built around a fixed core context, Core1, which provides a minimal background grammar of categories numbers, strings, user prompts, tools together with abstract combinators for booleans, predicates, pairs, and lists. Agent policies are written as ordinary expressions using a single abstraction operator so that conditionals appear as selections between alternatives instead of imperative if-else blocks. Domains extend the core by defining their own context-mini-grammars that introduce new categories, predicates, and external tools while reusing the same compositional machinery. We illustrate this with worked examples from thermostat control, home security, e-commerce recommendation, and medical monitoring, showing how natural language decision rules can be mapped to inspectable, executable policies. From a linguistic perspective, Prism enforces a clear separation between a reusable grammar-like core and domain specific lexicons and treats tools as bridges between internal policy representations and the external world. From an engineering perspective, it offers a compact interface language for agent control, making the space of possible actions explicit and amenable to analysis, verification, and safety constraints."}

This paper presents a novel Iterative Exchange Framework for MUCPP, balancing efficiency and fairness through iterative task exchanges and path refinements. The proposed framework formulates a composite objective that combines the total mission distance and the makespan, and iteratively improves the solution via local exchanges under feasibility and safety constraints.

However, expert action labeling often dominates the cost, especially in GPU-intensive simulators, human-in-the-loop settings, and robot fleets that revisit near-duplicate states. We present Conformalized Rejection Sampling for Active Imitation Learning (CRSAIL), a querying rule that requests an expert action only when the visited state is under-represented in the expert-labeled dataset. CRSAIL scores state novelty by the distance to the $K$-th nearest expert state and sets a single global threshold via conformal prediction. This threshold is the empirical $(1-α)$ quantile of on-policy calibration scores, providing a distribution-free calibration rule that links $α$ to the expected query rate and makes $α$ a task-agnostic tuning knob. This state-space querying strategy is robust to outliers and, unlike safety-gate-based AIL, can be run without real-time expert takeovers: we roll out full trajectories (episodes) with the learner and only afterward query the expert on a subset of visited states. Evaluated on MuJoCo robotics tasks, CRSAIL matches or exceeds expert-level reward while reducing total expert queries by up to 96% vs. DAgger and up to 65% vs. prior AIL methods, with empirical robustness to $α$ and $K$, easing deployment on novel systems with unknown dynamics."}

These challenges arise in many robotics domains, from urban driving and warehouse automation to defense and surveillance. Classical path planning approaches and memoryless reinforcement learning often fail under limited fields of view (FoVs) and occlusions, committing to unsafe or inefficient maneuvers. We propose a hierarchical navigation framework that integrates a Deep Transformer Q-Network (DTQN) as a high-level subgoal selector with a modular low-level controller for waypoint execution. The DTQN consumes short histories of task-aware features, encoding odometry, goal direction, obstacle proximity, and visibility cues, and outputs Q-values to rank candidate subgoals. Visibility-aware candidate generation introduces masking and exposure penalties, rewarding the use of cover and anticipatory safety. A low-level potential field controller then tracks the selected subgoal, ensuring smooth short-horizon obstacle avoidance. We validate our approach in 2D simulation and extend it directly to a 3D Unity-ROS environment by projecting point-cloud perception into the same feature schema, enabling transfer without architectural changes. Results show consistent improvements over classical planners and RL baselines in success rate, safety margins, and time to goal, with ablations confirming the value of temporal memory and visibility-aware candidate design. These findings highlight a generalizable framework for safe navigation under uncertainty, with broad relevance across robotic platforms."}

We construct a morphology-informed graph neural architecture that is provably equivariant with respect to the robot's morphological symmetry group actions, ensuring consistent policy responses under symmetric states while maintaining invariance in value estimation. This design eliminates the need for tedious reward shaping or costly data augmentation, which are typically required to enforce symmetry.

Based on that scheme, we propose WaterSearch, a sentence-level, search-based watermarking framework adaptable to a wide range of existing methods. WaterSearch enhances text quality by jointly optimizing two key aspects: 1) distribution fidelity and 2) watermark signal characteristics.

We identify the true challenge lies in assessing a novel dimension: Suitability, defined as conditional reliability under specific real-world perturbations. To this end, we introduce Reward Auditor, a hypothesis-testing framework specifically designed for RM suitability inference. Rather than answering \"How accurate is the RM's preference perception for given samples?\", it employs scientific auditing to answer: \"Can we infer RMs exhibit systematic vulnerabilities in specific real-world scenarios?\". Under real-world perturbed scenarios, Reward Auditor quantifies statistical significance and effect size by auditing distribution degradation of RM preference perception confidence. This enables inference of both the certainty and severity of RM vulnerabilities across diverse real-world scenarios. This lays a solid foundation for building next-generation LLM alignment systems that are verifiably safe, more robust, and trustworthy."}

The proposed approach addresses the computational bottleneck inherent in solving large-scale Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by introducing a two-stage decomposition strategy. In the first stage, a factor-based algorithm partitions the global MDP into smaller, goal-specific sub-MDPs by leveraging domain-specific features such as goal priority, fault states, spatial layout, and energy constraints. In the second stage, a priority-based recombination algorithm solves each sub-MDP independently and integrates the results into a unified global policy using a meta-policy for conflict resolution. Importantly, we present a theoretical analysis showing that, under mild probabilistic independence assumptions, the combined policy is provably equivalent to the optimal global MDP policy. Our work advances artificial intelligence (AI) decision scalability by decomposing large MDPs into tractable subproblems with provable global equivalence. The proposed decomposition framework enhances the scalability of Markov Decision Processes, a cornerstone of sequential decision-making in artificial intelligence, enabling real-time policy updates for complex mission environments. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating orders-of-magnitude reduction in computation time without sacrificing mission reliability or policy optimality.

This research project investigates whether prompt engineering (PE) methods can mitigate context inconsistency hallucinations in zero-shot LLM summarisation of scientific texts, where zero-shot indicates that the LLM relies purely on its pre-training data. Across eight yeast biotechnology research paper abstracts, six instruction-tuned LLMs were prompted with seven methods: a base- line prompt, two levels of increasing instruction complexity (PE-1 and PE-2), two levels of context repetition (CR-K1 and CR-K2), and two levels of random addition (RA-K1 and RA-K2). Context repetition involved the identification and repetition of K key sentences from the abstract, whereas random addition involved the repetition of K randomly selected sentences from the abstract, where K is 1 or 2. A total of 336 LLM-generated summaries were evaluated using six metrics: ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, BERTScore, METEOR, and cosine similarity, which were used to compute the lexical and semantic alignment be- tween the summaries and the abstracts. Four hypotheses on the effects of prompt methods on summary alignment with the reference text were tested. Statistical analysis on 3744 collected datapoints was performed using bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence intervals and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni-Holm correction. The results demonstrated that CR and RA significantly improve the lexical alignment of LLM-generated summaries with the abstracts.

This paper addresses these challenges by introducing the SoftMag actuator: a magnetic tactile-sensorized soft actuator. Unlike systems relying on attached sensors or treating sensing and actuation separately, SoftMag unifies them through a shared architecture while confronting the mechanical parasitic effect, where deformations corrupt tactile signals. A multiphysics simulation framework models this coupling, and a neural-network-based decoupling strategy removes the parasitic component, restoring sensing fidelity. Experiments including indentation, quasi-static and step actuation, and fatigue tests validate the actuator's performance and decoupling effectiveness. Building upon this foundation, the system is extended into a two-finger SoftMag gripper, where a multi-task neural network enables real-time prediction of tri-axial contact forces and position. Furthermore, a probing-based strategy estimates object firmness during grasping. Validation on apricots shows a strong correlation (Pearson r over 0.8) between gripper-estimated firmness and reference measurements, confirming the system's capability for non-destructive quality assessment. Results demonstrate that combining integrated magnetic sensing, learning-based correction, and real-time inference enables a soft robotic platform that adapts its grasp and quantifies material properties.

Existing studies often analyze these issues in isolation, failing to capture their joint effect on system behaviour and performance.\n  We introduce DeformAr (Debugging and Evaluation Framework for Transformer-based NER Systems), a novel framework designed to investigate and explain the performance discrepancy between Arabic and English NER systems. DeformAr integrates a data extraction library and an interactive dashboard, supporting two modes of evaluation: cross-component analysis and behavioural analysis. The framework divides each language into dataset and model components to examine their interactions.\n  The analysis proceeds in two stages. First, cross-component analysis provides systematic diagnostic measures across data and model subcomponents, addressing the \"what,\" \"how,\" and \"why\" behind observed discrepancies. The second stage applies behavioural analysis by combining interpretability techniques with token-level metrics, interactive visualisations, and representation space analysis. These stages enable a component-aware diagnostic process that detects model behaviours and explains them by linking them to underlying representational patterns and data factors. DeformAr is the first Arabic-specific, component-based interpretability tool, offering a crucial resource for advancing model analysis in under-resourced languages."}

One of the key barriers is the lack of motion planning algorithms that can provide verifiable guarantees for safety, efficiency and reliability. To address this, a family of algorithms called Constant-Time Motion Planning (CTMP) was introduced, which leverages a preprocessing phase to enable collision-free motion queries in a fixed, user-specified time budget (e.g., 10 milliseconds). However, existing CTMP methods do not explicitly incorporate the manipulation behaviors essential for object handling. To bridge this gap, we introduce the \\textit{Behavioral Constant-Time Motion Planner} (B-CTMP), an algorithm that extends CTMP to solve a broad class of two-step manipulation tasks: (1) a collision-free motion to a behavior initiation state, followed by (2) execution of a manipulation behavior (such as grasping or insertion) to reach the goal. By precomputing compact data structures, B-CTMP guarantees constant-time query in mere milliseconds while ensuring completeness and successful task execution over a specified set of states. We evaluate B-CTMP on two canonical manipulation tasks in simulation, shelf picking and plug insertion,and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real robot. Our results show that B-CTMP unifies collision-free planning and object manipulation within a single constant-time framework, providing provable guarantees of speed and success for manipulation in semi-structured environments."}

More specifically, the current scheme often simply relies on serializing the tabular data, together with the meta information, then inputting them through the LLMs. We argue that the loss of structural information is the root of this shortcoming. In this work, we further propose TAMO, which bears an ideology to treat the tables as an independent modality integrated with the text tokens. The resulting model in TAMO is a multimodal framework consisting of a hypergraph neural network as the global table encoder seamlessly integrated with the mainstream LLM.

The study investigates how different materials (metal, concrete and plywood) and UWB radio channels (5 and 9) influence the Channel Impulse Response (CIR). Furthermore, a processing pipeline is proposed to achieve reliable mapping of detected obstacles, consisting of 3 steps: (i) target identification (based on CIR peak detection), (ii) filtering (based on peak properties, signal-to-noise score, and phase-difference of arrival), and (iii) clustering (based on distance estimation and angle-of-arrival estimation). The proposed approach successfully reduces noise and multipath effects, resulting in an obstacle detection precision of at least 82.36% and a recall of 89.46% on channel 9 even when detecting low-reflective materials such as plywood. This work offers a foundation for further development of UWB-based localisation and mapping (SLAM) systems that do not rely on visual features and, unlike conventional UWB localisation systems, do not require on fixed anchor nodes for triangulation."}

This research expands that scope in two directions: first, by comparing two retrieval strategies, Graph RAG, structured knowledge-graph based, and Advanced RAG, hybrid keyword-semantic search, for QA; and second, by evaluating whether LLMs can generate high quality non-traditional academic outputs, specifically slide decks and podcast scripts. We implemented a prototype combining Meta's LLaMA 3 70B open weight and OpenAI's GPT 4o mini API based. QA performance was evaluated using both human ratings across eleven quality dimensions and large language model judges for scalable cross validation. GPT 4o mini with Advanced RAG produced the most accurate responses. Graph RAG offered limited improvements and led to more hallucinations, partly due to its structural complexity and manual setup. Slide and podcast generation was tested with document grounded retrieval. GPT 4o mini again performed best, though LLaMA 3 showed promise in narrative coherence. Human reviewers were crucial for detecting layout and stylistic flaws, highlighting the need for combined human LLM evaluation in assessing emerging academic outputs."}

These tasks are crucial in daily life, such as shaking a bottle or knocking a nail. However, few prior works have explored this task, leading to two main challenges: 1) the imitation methods often fail to complete these tasks within the expected terminal time due to the ineffective utilization of history; 2) the absence of a benchmark with sufficient data and automatic evaluation tools hinders development of effective solutions in this area. To address these challenges, we first propose the CycleManip framework to achieve cycle-based task manipulation in an end-to-end imitation manner without requiring any extra models, hierarchical structure or significant computational overhead. The core insight is to enhance effective history perception by a cost-aware sampling strategy and to improve historical understanding by multi-task learning. Second, we introduce a cycle-based task manipulation benchmark, which provides diverse cycle-based tasks, and an automatic evaluation method. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our method achieves high success rates in cycle-based task manipulation. The results further show strong adaptability performance in general manipulation, and the plug-and-play ability on imitation policies such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Moreover, the results show that our approach can be applied across diverse robotic platforms, including bi-arm grippers, dexterous hands, and humanoid robots."}

Current evaluations mostly report global rates such as false rejection or compliance. These scores treat each prompt alone and miss local inconsistency, where a model accepts one phrasing of an intent but rejects a close paraphrase. This gap limits diagnosis and tuning. We introduce \"semantic confusion,\" a failure mode that captures such local inconsistency, and a framework to measure it. We build ParaGuard, a 10k-prompt corpus of controlled paraphrase clusters that hold intent fixed while varying surface form. We then propose three model-agnostic metrics at the token level: Confusion Index, Confusion Rate, and Confusion Depth. These metrics compare each refusal to its nearest accepted neighbors and use token embeddings, next-token probabilities, and perplexity signals. Experiments across diverse model families and deployment guards show that global false-rejection rate hides critical structure. Our metrics reveal globally unstable boundaries in some settings, localized pockets of inconsistency in others, and cases where stricter refusal does not increase inconsistency. We also show how confusion-aware auditing separates how often a system refuses from how sensibly it refuses. This gives developers a practical signal to reduce false refusals while preserving safety."}

However, their real-world deployment remains slow and inefficient: demonstration videos are often sped up by 5-10x to appear smooth, with noticeable action stalls and delayed reactions to environmental changes. Asynchronous inference offers a promising solution to achieve continuous and low-latency control by enabling robots to execute actions and perform inference simultaneously. However, because the robot and environment continue to evolve during inference, a temporal misalignment arises between the prediction and execution intervals. This leads to significant action instability, while existing methods either degrade accuracy or introduce runtime overhead to mitigate it. We propose VLASH, a general asynchronous inference framework for VLAs that delivers smooth, accurate, and fast reaction control without additional overhead or architectural changes. VLASH estimates the future execution-time state by rolling the robot state forward with the previously generated action chunk, thereby bridging the gap between prediction and execution. Experiments show that VLASH achieves up to 2.03x speedup and reduces reaction latency by up to 17.4x compared to synchronous inference while fully preserving the original accuracy. Moreover, it empowers VLAs to handle fast-reaction, high-precision tasks such as playing ping-pong and playing whack-a-mole, where traditional synchronous inference fails.

However, most available quadruped robots are primarily focused on mobility without object manipulation capabilities. Equipping a quadruped robot with a robotic arm and gripper introduces a challenge in manual control, especially in remote scenarios that require complex commands. This research aims to develop an autonomous grasping system on a quadruped robot using a task-level interaction approach. The system includes hardware integration of a robotic arm and gripper onto the quadruped robot's body, a layered control system designed using ROS, and a web-based interface for human-robot interaction. The robot is capable of autonomously performing tasks such as navigation, object detection, and grasping using GraspNet. Testing was conducted through real-world scenarios to evaluate navigation, object selection and grasping, and user experience. The results show that the robot can perform tasks accurately and consistently, achieving a grasping success rate of 75 % from 12 trials. Therefore, the system demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the capabilities of quadruped robots as service robots in real-world environments."}

Unlike opaque evaluations, DrawingBench provides transparent, rule-based assessment: 8 objective criteria enable reproducible scoring, while action-level inspection allows stakeholders to audit agent behavior. Our framework comprises 250 diverse prompts across 20 categories and 4 difficulty levels, deterministic evaluation metrics, and an external oversight mechanism through multi-turn feedback that enables human control over agent refinement. Evaluating four state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude-4 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Gemini-2.5 Flash) across 1,000 tests, we establish both capabilities and limitations: models achieved 92.8% perfect performance with structured external feedback driving significant improvements (average +3.2%, up to +32.8% for complex scenes), but systematic error patterns emerged in tool state management and long-horizon planning. Notably, specification clarity proved more important than task complexity -- models achieved 100% perfect performance when given explicit, verifiable criteria. These findings demonstrate that transparent evaluation frameworks can establish trust in agentic systems, with external oversight proving more reliable than self-correction for guiding agent behavior.

However, existing systems face two limitations: (1) reliance on situation-centric datasets lacking persistent user identity, which hampers the capture of personalized affective nuances; and (2) dependence on opaque, coarse reward signals that hinder development of verifiable empathetic reasoning. To address these gaps, we introduce KardiaBench, a large-scale user-grounded benchmark comprising 178,080 QA pairs across 22,080 multi-turn conversations anchored to 671 real-world profiles. The dataset is constructed via a model-in-the-loop pipeline with iterative rubric-guided refinement to ensure psychological plausibility and persona consistency. This progressive empathy pipeline that integrates user comprehension, contextual reasoning, and emotion perception into conversations, followed by iterative critique and rubric-based refinement to ensure psychological plausibility, emotional fidelity, and persona consistency. Building on this, we propose Kardia-R1, a framework that trains models for interpretable, stepwise empathetic cognition. Kardia-R1 leverages Rubric-as-Judge Empathetic Reinforcement Learning (Rubric-ERL), a GRPO-based method that uses explainable, human-aligned rubric rewards to tightly couple user understanding, emotional inference, and supportive response generation. Extensive experiments across four LLM backbones demonstrate that Kardia-R1 consistently outperforms othet methods in emotion accuracy, empathy, relevance, persona consistency, and safety. Our dataset and model will be released at https://github.com/JhCircle/Kardia-R1."}

Under such partial observability, optimal behavior typically involves explicitly acting to gain the missing information. Today's standard robot learning techniques struggle to produce such active perception behaviors. We propose a simple real-world robot learning recipe to efficiently train active perception policies. Our approach, asymmetric advantage weighted regression (AAWR), exploits access to \"privileged\" extra sensors at training time. The privileged sensors enable training high-quality privileged value functions that aid in estimating the advantage of the target policy. Bootstrapping from a small number of potentially suboptimal demonstrations and an easy-to-obtain coarse policy initialization, AAWR quickly acquires active perception behaviors and boosts task performance. In evaluations on 8 manipulation tasks on 3 robots spanning varying degrees of partial observability, AAWR synthesizes reliable active perception behaviors that outperform all prior approaches. When initialized with a \"generalist\" robot policy that struggles with active perception tasks, AAWR efficiently generates information-gathering behaviors that allow it to operate under severe partial observability for manipulation tasks.

To reduce the number of utility function calls, probabilistic MBR (PMBR) decoding partially evaluates quality scores using sampled pairs of candidates and completes the missing scores with a matrix completion algorithm. Nevertheless, it degrades the translation quality as the number of utility function calls is reduced. Therefore, to improve the trade-off between quality and cost, we propose agreement-constrained PMBR (AC-PMBR) decoding, which leverages a knowledge distilled model to guide the completion of the score matrix.

To address this, we propose a Dynamic Fusion Learning Model (DyFuLM), a multimodal framework designed to capture both hierarchical semantic representations and fine-grained emotional nuances. DyFuLM introduces two key moodules: a Hierarchical Dynamic Fusion module that adaptively integrates multi-level features, and a Gated Feature Aggregation module that regulates cross-layer information ffow to achieve balanced representation learning. Comprehensive experiments on multi-task sentiment datasets demonstrate that DyFuLM achieves 82.64% coarse-grained and 68.48% fine-grained accuracy, yielding the lowest regression errors (MAE = 0.0674, MSE = 0.0082) and the highest R^2 coefficient of determination (R^2= 0.6903). Furthermore, the ablation study validates the effectiveness of each module in DyFuLM. When all modules are removed, the accuracy drops by 0.91% for coarse-grained and 0.68% for fine-grained tasks. Keeping only the gated fusion module causes decreases of 0.75% and 0.55%, while removing the dynamic loss mechanism results in drops of 0.78% and 0.26% for coarse-grained and fine-grained sentiment classification, respectively.

While single-drone tracking systems have been extensively studied, swarm-based target tracking remains underexplored, despite its unique advantages of distributed perception, fault-tolerant redundancy, and multidirectional target coverage. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel decentralized LiDAR-based swarm tracking framework that enables visibility-aware, cooperative target tracking in complex environments, while fully harnessing the unique capabilities of swarm systems. To address visibility, we introduce a novel Spherical Signed Distance Field (SSDF)-based metric for 3-D environmental occlusion representation, coupled with an efficient algorithm that enables real-time onboard SSDF updating. A general Field-of-View (FOV) alignment cost supporting heterogeneous LiDAR configurations is proposed for consistent target observation. Swarm coordination is enhanced through cooperative costs that enforce inter-robot safe clearance, prevent mutual occlusions, and notably facilitate 3-D multidirectional target encirclement via a novel electrostatic-potential-inspired distribution metric. These innovations are integrated into a hierarchical planner, combining a kinodynamic front-end searcher with a spatiotemporal $SE(3)$ back-end optimizer to generate collision-free, visibility-optimized trajectories.Deployed on heterogeneous LiDAR swarms, our fully decentralized implementation features collaborative perception, distributed planning, and dynamic swarm reconfigurability. Validated through rigorous real-world experiments in cluttered outdoor environments, the proposed system demonstrates robust cooperative tracking of agile targets (drones, humans) while achieving superior visibility maintenance."}

In practice, systems access LLMs via commercial APIs or open-source deployments, and the model landscape (e.g., GPT, Claude, Llama) evolves rapidly. This rapid evolution forces frequent model switches driven by capability, cost, deployment constraints, and privacy. Yet prompts are highly model-sensitive: reusing a prompt engineered for one model on another often yields substantially worse performance than a prompt optimized for the target model. We term this phenomenon Model Drifting. Through extensive empirical analysis across diverse LLM configurations, we show that model drifting is both common and severe. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptBridge, a training-free framework that preserves prompt effectiveness under model switches, enabling cross-model prompt transfer without costly per-task or per-model re-optimization. PromptBridge requires only a small set of alignment tasks for calibration. It first applies Model-Adaptive Reflective Prompt Evolution (MAP-RPE) to obtain task- and model-specific optimal prompts via iterative reflective refinement and quantitative evaluation. Using the resulting calibrated prompt pairs for the source and target models, PromptBridge learns a cross-model prompt mapping. At test time, i.e., for an unseen task, given a source-model prompt, this mapping directly produces an optimized prompt for the target model. Experiments in single-agent and multi-agent settings show that PromptBridge consistently improves downstream accuracy while reducing migration effort. The code will be available soon."}

Existing researches in this field mostly focus on using control based methods that struggle to cater diverse falling scenarios and may introduce unsuitable human prior. On the other hand, large-scale Deep Reinforcement Learning and Curriculum Learning could be employed to incentivize humanoid agent discovering falling protection policy that fits its own nature and property. In this work, with carefully designed reward functions and domain diversification curriculum, we successfully train humanoid agent to explore falling protection behaviors and discover that by forming a `triangle' structure, the falling damages could be significantly reduced with its rigid-material body. With comprehensive metrics and experiments, we quantify its performance with comparison to other methods, visualize its falling behaviors and successfully transfer it to real world platform."}

This challenge is particularly pronounced for objects made of glass, metal, or other materials whose transparent or reflective surfaces introduce severe out-of-distribution variations. Existing approaches either rely on simulated materials in simulators and perform sim-to-real transfer, which is hindered by substantial visual domain gaps, or depend on collecting extensive real-world demonstrations, which is costly, time-consuming, and still insufficient to cover various materials. To overcome these limitations, we resort to computational photography and introduce Mutable Material Manipulation Augmentation (M$^3$A), a unified framework that leverages the physical characteristics of materials as captured by light transport for photometric re-rendering. The core idea is simple yet powerful: given a single real-world demonstration, we photometrically re-render the scene to generate a diverse set of highly realistic demonstrations with different material properties. This augmentation effectively decouples task-specific manipulation skills from surface appearance, enabling policies to generalize across materials without additional data collection. To systematically evaluate this capability, we construct the first comprehensive multi-material manipulation benchmark spanning both simulation and real-world environments. Extensive experiments show that the M$^3$A policy significantly enhances cross-material generalization, improving the average success rate across three real-world tasks by 58.03\\%, and demonstrating robust performance on previously unseen materials."}

However, current research is constrained by two key challenges: language coverage and efficiency. Most of the popular S2TT datasets are substantially English-centric, which restricts the scaling-up of MLLMs' many-to-many translation capabilities. Moreover, the inference speed of MLLMs degrades dramatically when the speech is converted into long sequences (e.g., 750 tokens). To address these limitations, we propose a Multilingual Cost-effective Accelerated Speech-to-Text Translator (MCAT) framework, which includes two innovations. First, a language scaling method that leverages curriculum learning and a data balancing strategy is introduced to extend the language coverage supported by MLLMs to 70 languages and achieve mutual translation among these languages. Second, an optimized speech adapter module is designed to reduce the length of the speech sequence to only 30 tokens. Extensive experiments were conducted on MLLMs of different scales (9B and 27B). The experimental results demonstrate that MCAT not only surpasses state-of-the-art end-to-end models on the FLEURS dataset across 70x69 directions but also enhances batch inference efficiency. This is achieved with only ~100M trainable parameters and by using only 10 hours of S2TT data per language. Furthermore, we have released MCAT as open-source to promote the development of MLLMs for robust S2TT capabilities. The code and models are released at https://github.com/yxduir/m2m-70."}

This paper proposes a novel one-key calibration framework named L2M-Calib for a fused magnetic-LiDAR system, jointly estimating the extrinsic transformation between the two kinds of sensors and the intrinsic distortion parameters of the magnetic sensors. Magnetic sensors capture ambient magnetic field (AMF) patterns, which are invariant to geometry, texture, illumination, and weather, making them suitable for challenging environments. Nonetheless, the integration of magnetic sensing into multimodal systems remains underexplored due to the absence of effective calibration techniques. To address this, we optimize extrinsic parameters using an iterative Gauss-Newton scheme, coupled with the intrinsic calibration as a weighted ridge-regularized total least squares (w-RRTLS) problem, ensuring robustness against measurement noise and ill-conditioned data. Extensive evaluations on both simulated datasets and real-world experiments, including AGV-mounted sensor configurations, demonstrate that our method achieves high calibration accuracy and robustness under various environmental and operational conditions."}

We evaluate their performance on Yoruba, Kinyarwanda, and Amharic. While these languages are spoken by millions, their online usage on conversational platforms is often sparse, heavily influenced by English, and not representative of the authentic, monolingual conversations prevalent among native speakers. This lack of readily available authentic data online creates a challenge of scarcity of conversational data for training language models. To investigate this, data was collected from subreddits and local news sources for each language. The analysis showed a stark contrast between the two sources. Reddit data was minimal and characterized by heavy code-switching. Conversely, local news media offered a robust source of clean, monolingual language data, which also prompted more user engagement in the local language on the news publishers social media pages. Language detection models, including the specialized AfroLID and a general LLM, performed with near-perfect accuracy on the clean news data but struggled with the code-switched Reddit posts. The study concludes that professionally curated news content is a more reliable and effective source for training context-rich AI models for African languages than data from conversational platforms.

This letter introduces the Cross-Embodiment Gripper Benchmark (CEGB), a compact and reproducible benchmarking suite extending YCB and selected NIST metrics with three additional components: a transfer-time benchmark measuring the practical effort required to exchange embodiments, an energy-consumption benchmark evaluating grasping and holding efficiency, and an intent-specific ideal payload assessment reflecting design-dependent operational capability. Together, these metrics characterize both grasp performance and the suitability of reusing a single gripper across heterogeneous robotic systems. A lightweight self-locking gripper prototype is implemented as a reference case.

Current models often struggle to distinguish objective unsolvability (inherent contradictions in the problem) from subjective capability limitations (problems beyond the model's competence), which leads to hallucinations and overconfidence. To address this, we propose UnsolvableQA and UnsolvableRL to solve feasible problems, detect inherent contradictions, and prudently refuse tasks beyond capability. Specifically, we construct UnsolvableQA, a dataset of paired solvable and unsolvable instances derived via a dual-track methodology: programmatic generation for logic puzzles and a novel \"Reverse Construction\" method that injects contradictions into valid reasoning chains for mathematics. Building on this dataset, we introduce UnsolvableRL, a reinforcement learning framework with three reward components jointly accounting for accuracy, unsolvability, and difficulty. Empirical results show that our approach achieves near-perfect unsolvability detection while also improving accuracy on solvable tasks. Crucially, we identify Capability Collapse, demonstrating that explicit exposure to unsolvable data is indispensable for preventing models from becoming systematically overconfident.

Motived by this challenge, this paper aims to propose a novel Gaussian Process-based formulation of CBF, termed the Dynamic Log Gaussian Process Control Barrier Function (DLGP-CBF), to enable real-time construction of CBF which are both spatially informative and responsive to obstacle motion. Firstly, the DLGP-CBF leverages a logarithmic transformation of GP regression to generate smooth and informative barrier values and gradients, even in sparse-data regions. Secondly, by explicitly modeling the DLGP-CBF as a function of obstacle positions, the derived safety constraint integrates predicted obstacle velocities, allowing the controller to proactively respond to dynamic obstacles' motion. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in obstacle avoidance performance, including increased safety margins, smoother trajectories, and enhanced responsiveness compared to baseline methods."}

Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, we map these layers to technical components and outline strategies for coordination, prioritization, and conflict resolution. We demonstrate the approach through its implementation in the Heero conversational agent, where encrypted long-term bios and conversational history already improve engagement and retention. We further discuss implementation concerns around storage, retrieval, privacy, and latency, and highlight open challenges.

However, their performance often degrades under distribution shift and on complex multi-step tasks, suggesting that the learned representations may not robustly capture task-relevant semantics. We introduce DiG-Flow, a principled framework that enhances VLA robustness through geometric regularization. Our key insight is that the distributional discrepancy between observation and action embeddings provides a meaningful geometric signal: lower transport cost indicates compatible representations, while higher cost suggests potential misalignment. DiG-Flow computes a discrepancy measure between empirical distributions of observation and action embeddings, maps it to a modulation weight via a monotone function, and applies residual updates to the observation embeddings before flow matching. Crucially, this intervention operates at the representation level without modifying the flow matching path or target vector field. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that discrepancy-guided training provably decreases the training objective, and that guided inference refinement converges with contraction. Empirically, DiG-Flow integrates into existing VLA architectures with negligible overhead and consistently improves performance, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-step tasks and under limited training data."}

To examine the effect, we introduce \\textit{MuSoBench}, a benchmark of multi-solution problems. Experiments show that the conventional short chain-of-thought (Short-CoT) prompting paradigm exhibits pronounced overconfidence, whereas the emerging long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) approach mitigates it through iterative exploration and self-reflection. We further characterise observable behaviours and influential factors. To probe the underlying cause, we propose the \\textbf{cognitive-rigidity hypothesis}, which posits that overconfidence arises when the reasoning process prematurely converges on a narrow set of thought paths.

However, on-robot data collection is labor-intensive and often limited to specific environments. In contrast, open-world images capture a vast diversity of real-world scenes that naturally align with robotic manipulation tasks, offering a promising avenue for low-cost, large-scale robot data acquisition. Despite this potential, the lack of associated robot actions hinders the practical use of open-world images for robot learning, leaving this rich visual resource largely unexploited. To bridge this gap, we propose IGen, a framework that scalably generates realistic visual observations and executable actions from open-world images. IGen first converts unstructured 2D pixels into structured 3D scene representations suitable for scene understanding and manipulation. It then leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models to transform scene-specific task instructions into high-level plans and generate low-level actions as SE(3) end-effector pose sequences. From these poses, it synthesizes dynamic scene evolution and renders temporally coherent visual observations. Experiments validate the high quality of visuomotor data generated by IGen, and show that policies trained solely on IGen-synthesized data achieve performance comparable to those trained on real-world data. This highlights the potential of IGen to support scalable data generation from open-world images for generalist robotic policy training."}

To pioneer in this direction, this paper presents OmiGraph, the first omission-aware framework for misinformation detection. Specifically, OmiGraph constructs an omission-aware graph for the target news by utilizing a contextual environment that captures complementary perspectives of the same event, thereby surfacing potentially omitted contents. Based on this graph, omission-oriented relation modeling is then proposed to identify the internal contextual dependencies, as well as the dynamic omission intents, formulating a comprehensive omission relation representation. Finally, to extract omission patterns for detection, OmiGraph introduces omission-aware message-passing and aggregation that establishes holistic deception perception by integrating the omission contents and relations. Experiments show that, by considering the omission perspective, our approach attains remarkable performance, achieving average improvements of +5.4% F1 and +5.3% ACC on two large-scale benchmarks."}

Assuming the optimality of human demonstrations is core to existing VLA policies. However, we claim that in highly dexterous and precise manipulation tasks, human demonstrations are noisy and suboptimal. GR-RL proposes a multi-stage training pipeline that filters, augments, and reinforces the demonstrations by reinforcement learning. First, GR-RL learns a vision-language-conditioned task progress, filters the demonstration trajectories, and only keeps the transitions that contribute positively to the progress. Specifically, we show that by directly applying offline RL with sparse reward, the resulting $Q$-values can be treated as a robust progress function. Next, we introduce morphological symmetry augmentation that greatly improves the generalization and performance of GR-RL. Lastly, to better align the VLA policy with its deployment behaviors for high-precision control, we perform online RL by learning a latent space noise predictor. With this pipeline, GR-RL is, to our knowledge, the first learning-based policy that can autonomously lace up a shoe by threading shoelaces through multiple eyelets with an 83.3% success rate, a task requiring long-horizon reasoning, millimeter-level precision, and compliant soft-body interaction.

There has been much speculation as to the factors underlying their successes, ranging from capturing multi-modal action distribution to expressing more complex behaviors. In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of popular generative control policies (GCPs) on common behavior cloning (BC) benchmarks. We find that GCPs do not owe their success to their ability to capture multi-modality or to express more complex observation-to-action mappings. Instead, we find that their advantage stems from iterative computation, as long as intermediate steps are supervised during training and this supervision is paired with a suitable level of stochasticity. As a validation of our findings, we show that a minimum iterative policy (MIP), a lightweight two-step regression-based policy, essentially matches the performance of flow GCPs, and often outperforms distilled shortcut models. Our results suggest that the distribution-fitting component of GCPs is less salient than commonly believed, and point toward new design spaces focusing solely on control performance.

However, this explicit reasoning process also introduces new safety risks, as unsafe behaviors often emerge within intermediate reasoning trajectories, even when final answers appear harmless. Existing safety alignment approaches primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over safety-oriented long CoT datasets. While intuitive, we find that SFT produces inconsistent safety improvements, degrades reasoning ability, and generalizes poorly across model families. These limitations suggest that purely supervised approaches are insufficient for robust safety alignment in LRMs. To address this, we investigate reinforcement learning (RL) as a complementary optimization framework for LRM safety training. Unlike SFT, RL directly optimizes model policies with reward feedback, enabling more adaptive and stable alignment. Extensive experiments across multiple model families and benchmarks show that RL achieves stronger and more consistent safety gains while maintaining reasoning competence. Further analysis of reflection dynamics and token-level entropy reveals that RL suppresses unsafe exploratory reasoning while preserving reflective depth, leading to safer and more reliable reasoning processes."}

We propose a novel deep active inference framework that consists of a world model, an action model, and an abstract world model. The world model encodes environmental dynamics into hidden state representations at slow and fast timescales. The action model compresses action sequences into abstract actions using vector quantization, and the abstract world model predicts future slow states conditioned on the abstract action, enabling low-cost action selection. We evaluate the framework on object-manipulation tasks with a real-world robot. Results show that it achieves high success rates across diverse manipulation tasks and switches between goal-directed and exploratory actions in uncertain settings, while making action selection computationally tractable.

A major challenge is their `aptitude' for hallucinating and generating harmful contents. Despite major efforts for implementing guardrails, human perceptions of these mitigation strategies are largely unknown. We conducted a mixed-method experiment for evaluating the responses of a mitigation strategy across multiple-dimensions: faithfulness, fairness, harm-removal capacity, and relevance. In a within-subject study design, 57 participants assessed the responses under two conditions: harmful response plus its mitigation and solely mitigated response. Results revealed that participants' native language, AI work experience, and annotation familiarity significantly influenced evaluations. Participants showed high sensitivity to linguistic and contextual attributes, penalizing minor grammar errors while rewarding preserved semantic contexts. This contrasts with how language is often treated in the quantitative evaluation of LLMs. We also introduced new metrics for training and evaluating mitigation strategies and insights for human-AI evaluation studies."}

This method produces not only binary classification labels but also fine-grained failure categories and step-by-step reasoning traces in both simulation and the real world. With it, we construct three new failure detection benchmarks: RLBench-Fail, BridgeDataV2-Fail, and UR5-Fail, substantially expanding the diversity and scale of existing failure datasets. We then train Guardian, a VLM with multi-view images for detailed failure reasoning and detection. Guardian achieves state-of-the-art performance on both existing and newly introduced benchmarks. It also effectively improves task success rates when integrated into a state-of-the-art manipulation system in simulation and real robots, demonstrating the impact of our generated failure data."}

However, such policies suffer from covariate shift when deployed in closed loop, leading to compounding errors. We introduce Rollouts as Demonstrations (RoaD), a simple and efficient method to mitigate covariate shift by leveraging the policy's own closed-loop rollouts as additional training data. During rollout generation, RoaD incorporates expert guidance to bias trajectories toward high-quality behavior, producing informative yet realistic demonstrations for fine-tuning. This approach enables robust closed-loop adaptation with orders of magnitude less data than reinforcement learning, and avoids restrictive assumptions of prior closed-loop supervised fine-tuning (CL-SFT) methods, allowing broader applications domains including end-to-end driving. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RoaD on WOSAC, a large-scale traffic simulation benchmark, where it performs similar or better than the prior CL-SFT method; and in AlpaSim, a high-fidelity neural reconstruction-based simulator for end-to-end driving, where it improves driving score by 41\\% and reduces collisions by 54\\%."}

To this end, we introduce latent debate, a novel framework for interpreting model predictions through the lens of implicit internal arguments. Unlike the current work of self-consistency and multi-agent debate, which relies on explicit debates among multiple answers or multiple models, latent debate captures the hidden supporting and attacking signals that arise within a single model during a single inference. We first present a model- and task-agnostic conceptual framework, and then instantiate it symbolically to approximate the thinking process of LLMs on True/False prediction tasks. Empirical studies demonstrate that latent debate is a faithful structured surrogate model that has highly consistent predictions with the original LLM. Beyond interpretability, we demonstrate that latent debate provides a strong baseline for hallucination detection. Further analysis reveals strong correlations between hallucinations and debate patterns, such as a high degree of latent debates in the middle layers is linked to a higher risk of hallucinations. These findings position latent debate as a potential framework for understanding internal mechanisms of LLMs, especially for scenarios where internal (dis)agreements appear during the inference steps."}

Despite these advances, long-CoT LLMs often exhibit suboptimal reasoning behaviors, such as overthinking and excessively protracted reasoning chains, which can impair performance. In this paper, we analyze reasoning processes through an optimization lens, framing CoT as a gradient descent procedure where each reasoning step constitutes an update toward problem resolution. Building on this perspective, we introduce RePro (Rectifying Process-level Reward), a novel approach to refine LLM reasoning during post-training. RePro defines a surrogate objective function to assess the optimization process underlying CoT, utilizing a dual scoring mechanism to quantify its intensity and stability. These scores are aggregated into a composite process-level reward, seamlessly integrated into reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines to optimize LLMs. Extensive experiments across multiple reinforcement learning algorithms and diverse LLMs, evaluated on benchmarks spanning mathematics, science, and coding, demonstrate that RePro consistently enhances reasoning performance and mitigates suboptimal reasoning behaviors."}

To enhance the reliability of operation code generated by LLMs, corrective designs with feedback from the observation of executing code have been increasingly adopted in existing research. However, the code execution in these designs relies on either a physical experiment or a customized simulation environment, which limits their deployment due to the high configuration effort of the environment and the potential long execution time. In this paper, we explore the possibility of directly leveraging LLM to enable static simulation of robot operation code, and then leverage it to design a new reliable LLM-driven corrective robot operation code generation framework. Our framework configures the LLM as a static simulator with enhanced capabilities that reliably simulate robot code execution by interpreting actions, reasoning over state transitions, analyzing execution outcomes, and generating se- mantic observations that accurately capture trajectory dynamics. To validate the performance of our framework, we performed experiments on various operation tasks for different robots, including UAVs and small ground vehicles. The experiment results not only demonstrated the high accuracy of our static text-based simulation but also the reliable code generation of our LLM-driven corrective framework, which achieves a comparable performance with state-of-the-art research while does not rely on dynamic code execution using physical experiments or simulators."}

To address these gaps, we present Fine-grained DEepResearch bench (FINDER), an enhanced benchmark consisting of 100 human-curated research tasks with 419 structured checklist items that standardize report structure, analytical depth, and factual grounding. Based on approximately 1,000 reports produced by mainstream DRAs, we further propose Deep rEsearch Failure Taxonomy (DEFT), the first failure taxonomy for deep research agents. DEFT contains 14 fine-grained failure modes across reasoning, retrieval, and generation, and is built upon grounded theory with human-LLM co-annotating and inter-annotator reliability validation. Our experimental findings reveal that current DRAs struggle not with task comprehension but with evidence integration, verification, and reasoning-resilient planning."}

The framework has three stages. First, we train reinforcement learning policies in simulation using simplified object models that lead to the emergence of correct finger gaits. We then use the learned policy as a skill primitive within a teleoperation system to collect real-world demonstrations that contain tactile and proprioceptive information. Finally, we train a behavior cloning policy that incorporates tactile sensing and show that it generalizes to nuts and screwdrivers with diverse geometries. Experiments across both tasks show high task progress ratios compared to direct sim-to-real transfer and robust performance even on unseen object shapes and under external perturbations.

To address these gaps, we conduct the first large-scale study of TTS, spanning over thirty billion tokens generated using eight open-source LLMs (7B to 235B parameters), across four reasoning datasets. We observe three consistent trends: (1) no single TTS strategy universally dominates; (2) reasoning models exhibit distinct trace-quality patterns across problem difficulty and trace length, forming short-horizon and long-horizon categories; and (3) for a given model type, the optimal TTS performance scales monotonically with compute budget. Based on these insights, we provide a practical recipe for selecting the best TTS strategy, considering problem difficulty, model type, and compute budget, providing a practical guide to effective inference-time scaling."}

However, when confronted with long-horizon tasks that require defined goal states, such as LEGO assembly or object rearrangement, existing VLA models still face challenges in coordinating high-level planning with precise manipulation. Therefore, we aim to endow a VLA model with the capability to infer the \"how\" process from the \"what\" outcomes, transforming goal states into executable procedures. In this paper, we introduce ManualVLA, a unified VLA framework built upon a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, enabling coherent collaboration between multimodal manual generation and action execution. Unlike prior VLA models that directly map sensory inputs to actions, we first equip ManualVLA with a planning expert that generates intermediate manuals consisting of images, position prompts, and textual instructions. Building upon these multimodal manuals, we design a Manual Chain-of-Thought (ManualCoT) reasoning process that feeds them into the action expert, where each manual step provides explicit control conditions, while its latent representation offers implicit guidance for accurate manipulation. To alleviate the burden of data collection, we develop a high-fidelity digital-twin toolkit based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which automatically generates manual data for planning expert training. ManualVLA demonstrates strong real-world performance, achieving an average success rate 32% higher than the previous hierarchical SOTA baseline on LEGO assembly and object rearrangement tasks."}

However, to accelerate computation with NVFP4, all matrix multiplication operands--weights and activations in the forward pass, and weights, activations, and gradients in the backward pass--must be quantized to NVFP4, often leading to divergence during training and performance degradation during inference. NVFP4 by evaluating multiple potential scale factors for each block of values. To address this issue, in this work we introduce Four Over Six (4/6), a modification to the NVFP4 quantization algorithm that evaluates two potential scale factors for each block of values. Unlike integer formats, floating-point formats such as FP4 have the most quantization error on near-maximal values in each block, which we find to be primarily responsible for downstream performance degradation. We find that for some blocks, scaling to smaller FP4 values makes the distribution of representable values more uniform, improving representation of near-maximal values. Importantly, 4/6 can be implemented efficiently on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, making it viable to use while training LLMs with NVFP4. In pre-training experiments with transformer and hybrid model architectures, we find that 4/6 prevents divergence in several cases, bringing training loss significantly closer to BF16 compared to models trained with current state-of-the-art NVFP4 training recipes. We also find that 4/6 can be easily incorporated into many different post-training quantization methods and generally improves downstream accuracy. We hope this inspires future work in training and deploying models with NVFP4."}

We theoretically prove that when using an isotropic Gaussian prior and an equivariant velocity prediction network, the resulting action distribution remains equivariant, leading to improved generalization and substantially reduced data demands. To accelerate sampling, we propose a novel acceleration regularization strategy. As direct computation of acceleration is intractable for marginal flow trajectories, we derive a novel surrogate loss that enables stable and scalable training using only conditional trajectories.
