### [1] [A Quality-Guided Mixture of Score-Fusion Experts Framework for Human Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00053)
*Jie Zhu,Yiyang Su,Minchul Kim,Anil Jain,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为QME的新框架，通过可学习的分数融合策略改进全身生物识别性能，解决了传统方法中分数分布变化和数据质量差异的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全身生物识别方法通过分数融合处理多模态数据，但可能忽略各模态分数分布的差异，限制了性能提升。

Method: QME框架结合了Mixture of Experts（MoE）和两种新损失函数：伪质量损失用于质量估计，分数三元组损失用于改进度量性能。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，QME在各项指标上均优于基线方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: QME框架有效解决了多模态和多模型中的关键挑战，如相似性分数域中的模型不对齐和数据质量变化。

Abstract: Whole-body biometric recognition is a challenging multimodal task that
integrates various biometric modalities, including face, gait, and body. This
integration is essential for overcoming the limitations of unimodal systems.
Traditionally, whole-body recognition involves deploying different models to
process multiple modalities, achieving the final outcome by score-fusion (e.g.,
weighted averaging of similarity matrices from each model). However, these
conventional methods may overlook the variations in score distributions of
individual modalities, making it challenging to improve final performance. In
this work, we present \textbf{Q}uality-guided \textbf{M}ixture of score-fusion
\textbf{E}xperts (QME), a novel framework designed for improving whole-body
biometric recognition performance through a learnable score-fusion strategy
using a Mixture of Experts (MoE). We introduce a novel pseudo-quality loss for
quality estimation with a modality-specific Quality Estimator (QE), and a score
triplet loss to improve the metric performance. Extensive experiments on
multiple whole-body biometric datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art results across various metrics
compared to baseline methods. Our method is effective for multimodal and
multi-model, addressing key challenges such as model misalignment in the
similarity score domain and variability in data quality.

### [2] [Punching Bag vs. Punching Person: Motion Transferability in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00085)
*Raiyaan Abdullah,Jared Claypoole,Michael Cogswell,Ajay Divakaran,Yogesh Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了动作识别模型在高层次动作概念跨上下文迁移中的表现，发现模型在新情境下识别能力显著下降，并提出了一种运动可迁移性框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估动作识别模型是否能有效迁移高层次动作概念到不同上下文，尤其是在类似分布中。

Method: 方法包括引入三个数据集（Syn-TA、Kinetics400-TA、Something-Something-v2-TA）并评估13种先进模型的表现。

Result: 结果显示模型在新情境下识别能力下降，且多模态模型在细粒度动作上表现更差；Syn-TA数据集与真实数据集同样具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 结论认为研究为动作识别中的运动可迁移性评估提供了重要基准，并探讨了分离粗粒度和细粒度动作的潜在改进方向。

Abstract: Action recognition models demonstrate strong generalization, but can they
effectively transfer high-level motion concepts across diverse contexts, even
within similar distributions? For example, can a model recognize the broad
action "punching" when presented with an unseen variation such as "punching
person"? To explore this, we introduce a motion transferability framework with
three datasets: (1) Syn-TA, a synthetic dataset with 3D object motions; (2)
Kinetics400-TA; and (3) Something-Something-v2-TA, both adapted from natural
video datasets. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models on these benchmarks and
observe a significant drop in performance when recognizing high-level actions
in novel contexts. Our analysis reveals: 1) Multimodal models struggle more
with fine-grained unknown actions than with coarse ones; 2) The bias-free
Syn-TA proves as challenging as real-world datasets, with models showing
greater performance drops in controlled settings; 3) Larger models improve
transferability when spatial cues dominate but struggle with intensive temporal
reasoning, while reliance on object and background cues hinders generalization.
We further explore how disentangling coarse and fine motions can improve
recognition in temporally challenging datasets. We believe this study
establishes a crucial benchmark for assessing motion transferability in action
recognition. Datasets and relevant code:

### [3] [The Monado SLAM Dataset for Egocentric Visual-Inertial Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00088)
*Mateo de Mayo,Daniel Cremers,Taihú Pire*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了Monado SLAM数据集，旨在解决现有VIO/SLAM系统在头戴设备应用中难以应对的挑战性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIO/SLAM系统在头戴设备应用中无法有效处理高动态运动、遮挡、低纹理环境等问题，缺乏相关数据集支持。

Method: 通过收集多个虚拟现实头戴设备的真实序列数据，构建Monado SLAM数据集。

Result: 发布了Monado SLAM数据集，采用CC BY 4.0许可，以推动VIO/SLAM研究。

Conclusion: 该数据集填补了现有研究的空白，有助于改进头戴设备中的跟踪技术。

Abstract: Humanoid robots and mixed reality headsets benefit from the use of
head-mounted sensors for tracking. While advancements in visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have produced
new and high-quality state-of-the-art tracking systems, we show that these are
still unable to gracefully handle many of the challenging settings presented in
the head-mounted use cases. Common scenarios like high-intensity motions,
dynamic occlusions, long tracking sessions, low-textured areas, adverse
lighting conditions, saturation of sensors, to name a few, continue to be
covered poorly by existing datasets in the literature. In this way, systems may
inadvertently overlook these essential real-world issues. To address this, we
present the Monado SLAM dataset, a set of real sequences taken from multiple
virtual reality headsets. We release the dataset under a permissive CC BY 4.0
license, to drive advancements in VIO/SLAM research and development.

### [4] [Exploring the Feasibility of Deep Learning Techniques for Accurate Gender Classification from Eye Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00135)
*Basna Mohammed Salih Hasan,Ramadhan J. Mstafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的模型，利用眼周区域的颜色图像进行性别分类，并在两个数据集上取得了高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 性别分类在安全、人机交互等领域至关重要，但化妆品和伪装等因素会影响分类准确性。研究专注于眼周区域以解决这一问题。

Method: 采用CNN模型，利用眼周区域的颜色图像提取特征，并在CVBL和（Female and Male）数据集上进行测试。

Result: 模型在CVBL数据集上达到99%准确率，在（Female and Male）数据集上达到96%准确率，参数量较少（7,235,089）。

Conclusion: 模型表现优异，适用于安全和监控等实际应用。

Abstract: Gender classification has emerged as a crucial aspect in various fields,
including security, human-machine interaction, surveillance, and advertising.
Nonetheless, the accuracy of this classification can be influenced by factors
such as cosmetics and disguise. Consequently, our study is dedicated to
addressing this concern by concentrating on gender classification using color
images of the periocular region. The periocular region refers to the area
surrounding the eye, including the eyelids, eyebrows, and the region between
them. It contains valuable visual cues that can be used to extract key features
for gender classification. This paper introduces a sophisticated Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) model that utilizes color image databases to evaluate the
effectiveness of the periocular region for gender classification. To validate
the model's performance, we conducted tests on two eye datasets, namely CVBL
and (Female and Male). The recommended architecture achieved an outstanding
accuracy of 99% on the previously unused CVBL dataset while attaining a
commendable accuracy of 96% with a small number of learnable parameters
(7,235,089) on the (Female and Male) dataset. To ascertain the effectiveness of
our proposed model for gender classification using the periocular region, we
evaluated its performance through an extensive range of metrics and compared it
with other state-of-the-art approaches. The results unequivocally demonstrate
the efficacy of our model, thereby suggesting its potential for practical
application in domains such as security and surveillance.

### [5] [World Consistency Score: A Unified Metric for Video Generation Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00144)
*Akshat Rakheja,Aarsh Ashdhir,Aryan Bhattacharjee,Vanshika Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: World Consistency Score (WCS) 是一种新的视频生成模型评估指标，强调生成视频的内部世界一致性，通过四个可解释的子指标（物体持久性、关系稳定性、因果合规性和闪烁惩罚）综合计算，并通过学习权重公式结合为一个分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频评估指标多关注视觉保真度或提示对齐，缺乏对时间与物理一致性的全面评估，WCS旨在填补这一空白。

Method: WCS结合四个子指标，使用开源工具（如跟踪器、动作识别器、CLIP嵌入和光流）计算，并通过人类偏好数据训练权重公式。

Result: WCS在VBench-2.0、EvalCrafter和LOVE等基准测试中验证了与人类评价的相关性，并与其他指标（如FVD、CLIPScore）进行了对比。

Conclusion: WCS提供了一个全面且可解释的框架，用于评估视频生成模型在时间与物理一致性方面的表现。

Abstract: We introduce World Consistency Score (WCS), a novel unified evaluation metric
for generative video models that emphasizes internal world consistency of the
generated videos. WCS integrates four interpretable sub-components - object
permanence, relation stability, causal compliance, and flicker penalty - each
measuring a distinct aspect of temporal and physical coherence in a video.
These submetrics are combined via a learned weighted formula to produce a
single consistency score that aligns with human judgments. We detail the
motivation for WCS in the context of existing video evaluation metrics,
formalize each submetric and how it is computed with open-source tools
(trackers, action recognizers, CLIP embeddings, optical flow), and describe how
the weights of the WCS combination are trained using human preference data. We
also outline an experimental validation blueprint: using benchmarks like
VBench-2.0, EvalCrafter, and LOVE to test WCS's correlation with human
evaluations, performing sensitivity analyses, and comparing WCS against
established metrics (FVD, CLIPScore, VBench, FVMD). The proposed WCS offers a
comprehensive and interpretable framework for evaluating video generation
models on their ability to maintain a coherent "world" over time, addressing
gaps left by prior metrics focused only on visual fidelity or prompt alignment.

### [6] [GeoExplorer: Active Geo-localization with Curiosity-Driven Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00152)
*Li Mi,Manon Bechaz,Zeming Chen,Antoine Bosselut,Devis Tuia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出GeoExplorer，一种结合好奇心驱动探索的主动地理定位（AGL）方法，解决了传统距离奖励方法在目标与环境变化时的鲁棒性和泛化能力不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AGL方法依赖距离奖励，在目标或环境变化时表现不佳，缺乏鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出GeoExplorer，通过内在奖励实现好奇心驱动探索，不依赖目标距离，提升探索多样性和环境建模能力。

Result: 在四个AGL基准测试中验证了GeoExplorer的有效性，尤其在陌生目标和环境中表现优异。

Conclusion: GeoExplorer通过好奇心驱动探索显著提升了AGL任务的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Active Geo-localization (AGL) is the task of localizing a goal, represented
in various modalities (e.g., aerial images, ground-level images, or text),
within a predefined search area. Current methods approach AGL as a
goal-reaching reinforcement learning (RL) problem with a distance-based reward.
They localize the goal by implicitly learning to minimize the relative distance
from it. However, when distance estimation becomes challenging or when
encountering unseen targets and environments, the agent exhibits reduced
robustness and generalization ability due to the less reliable exploration
strategy learned during training. In this paper, we propose GeoExplorer, an AGL
agent that incorporates curiosity-driven exploration through intrinsic rewards.
Unlike distance-based rewards, our curiosity-driven reward is goal-agnostic,
enabling robust, diverse, and contextually relevant exploration based on
effective environment modeling. These capabilities have been proven through
extensive experiments across four AGL benchmarks, demonstrating the
effectiveness and generalization ability of GeoExplorer in diverse settings,
particularly in localizing unfamiliar targets and environments.

### [7] [Robust 3D Object Detection using Probabilistic Point Clouds from Single-Photon LiDARs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00169)
*Bhavya Goyal,Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan,Wei Lin,Andreas Velten,Yin Li,Mohit Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为概率点云（PPC）的新型3D场景表示方法，通过为每个点添加概率属性来封装原始数据的不确定性，从而提升3D物体检测的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LiDAR在远距离或低反光物体等场景中会产生稀疏或错误的点云，这些误差会传播到下游感知模型中，导致精度下降。传统3D处理流程未保留原始测量中的不确定性信息。

Method: 提出PPC表示方法，为每个点添加概率属性，并开发了基于PPC的轻量级推理模块，适用于3D推理流程。

Result: 通过仿真和实际数据验证，PPC方法在室内外场景中优于LiDAR及相机-LiDAR融合模型，尤其在处理小、远、低反光物体及强环境光时表现更优。

Conclusion: PPC通过封装测量不确定性，显著提升了3D物体检测的鲁棒性，适用于多种挑战性场景。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D sensors provide point clouds, a canonical 3D representation
used in various scene understanding tasks. Modern LiDARs face key challenges in
several real-world scenarios, such as long-distance or low-albedo objects,
producing sparse or erroneous point clouds. These errors, which are rooted in
the noisy raw LiDAR measurements, get propagated to downstream perception
models, resulting in potentially severe loss of accuracy. This is because
conventional 3D processing pipelines do not retain any uncertainty information
from the raw measurements when constructing point clouds.
  We propose Probabilistic Point Clouds (PPC), a novel 3D scene representation
where each point is augmented with a probability attribute that encapsulates
the measurement uncertainty (or confidence) in the raw data. We further
introduce inference approaches that leverage PPC for robust 3D object
detection; these methods are versatile and can be used as computationally
lightweight drop-in modules in 3D inference pipelines. We demonstrate, via both
simulations and real captures, that PPC-based 3D inference methods outperform
several baselines using LiDAR as well as camera-LiDAR fusion models, across
challenging indoor and outdoor scenarios involving small, distant, and
low-albedo objects, as well as strong ambient light.

### [8] [On the Risk of Misleading Reports: Diagnosing Textual Biases in Multimodal Clinical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00171)
*David Restrepo,Ira Ktena,Maria Vakalopoulou,Stergios Christodoulidis,Enzo Ferrante*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于扰动的选择性模态转移（SMS）方法，用于量化视觉语言模型（VLMs）在二元分类任务中对不同模态的依赖，揭示了模型对文本输入的显著偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策需要综合分析医学图像和相关报告，但现有视觉语言模型可能偏向某一模态，忽略关键视觉信息。

Method: 通过系统性地交换样本中的图像或文本，评估六种开源VLM在两种医学影像数据集上的表现和校准情况。

Result: 研究发现模型对文本输入有显著依赖，视觉信息常被忽略。

Conclusion: 强调设计和评估真正整合视觉与文本线索的多模态医学模型的重要性。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies on the integrated analysis of medical images
and the associated clinical reports. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can
offer a unified framework for such tasks, they can exhibit strong biases toward
one modality, frequently overlooking critical visual cues in favor of textual
information. In this work, we introduce Selective Modality Shifting (SMS), a
perturbation-based approach to quantify a model's reliance on each modality in
binary classification tasks. By systematically swapping images or text between
samples with opposing labels, we expose modality-specific biases. We assess six
open-source VLMs-four generalist models and two fine-tuned for medical data-on
two medical imaging datasets with distinct modalities: MIMIC-CXR (chest X-ray)
and FairVLMed (scanning laser ophthalmoscopy). By assessing model performance
and the calibration of every model in both unperturbed and perturbed settings,
we reveal a marked dependency on text input, which persists despite the
presence of complementary visual information. We also perform a qualitative
attention-based analysis which further confirms that image content is often
overshadowed by text details. Our findings highlight the importance of
designing and evaluating multimodal medical models that genuinely integrate
visual and textual cues, rather than relying on single-modality signals.

Conclusion: 图谱系及其骨架操作适用于层次化模型架构和局部算法设计，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Graphs, and sequences of growing graphs, can be used to specify the
architecture of mathematical models in many fields including machine learning
and computational science. Here we define structured graph "lineages" (ordered
by level number) that grow in a hierarchical fashion, so that: (1) the number
of graph vertices and edges increases exponentially in level number; (2)
bipartite graphs connect successive levels within a graph lineage and, as in
multigrid methods, can constrain matrices relating successive levels; (3) using
prolongation maps within a graph lineage, process-derived distance measures
between graphs at successive levels can be defined; (4) a category of "graded
graphs" can be defined, and using it low-cost "skeletal" variants of standard
algebraic graph operations and type constructors (cross product, box product,
disjoint sum, and function types) can be derived for graded graphs and hence
hierarchical graph lineages; (5) these skeletal binary operators have similar
but not identical algebraic and category-theoretic properties to their standard
counterparts; (6) graph lineages and their skeletal product constructors can
approach continuum limit objects. Additional space-efficient unary operators on
graded graphs are also derived: thickening, which creates a graph lineage of
multiscale graphs, and escalation to a graph lineage of search frontiers
(useful as a generalization of adaptive grids and in defining "skeletal"
functions). The result is an algebraic type theory for graded graphs and
(hierarchical) graph lineages. The approach is expected to be well suited to
defining hierarchical model architectures - "hierarchitectures" - and local
sampling, search, or optimization algorithms on them. We demonstrate such
application to deep neural networks (including visual and feature scale spaces)
and to multigrid numerical methods.

### [10] [Learning Personalised Human Internal Cognition from External Expressive Behaviours for Real Personality Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00205)
*Xiangyu Kong,Hengde Zhu,Haoqin Sun,Zhihao Guo,Jiayan Gu,Xinyi Ni,Wei Zhang,Shizhe Liu,Siyang Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于个性化内部认知的自动真实人格识别方法，通过模拟目标个体的内部认知来提升识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常作为外部观察者推断人格印象，与真实人格偏差较大，性能较差。

Method: 通过短音频-视觉行为模拟个性化内部认知，构建二维图表示，并使用2D-GNN进行人格推断。

Result: 提出了一种端到端的训练策略，联合优化认知模拟、图构建和人格识别模块。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模拟内部认知，显著提升了真实人格识别的性能。

Abstract: Automatic real personality recognition (RPR) aims to evaluate human real
personality traits from their expressive behaviours. However, most existing
solutions generally act as external observers to infer observers' personality
impressions based on target individuals' expressive behaviours, which
significantly deviate from their real personalities and consistently lead to
inferior recognition performance. Inspired by the association between real
personality and human internal cognition underlying the generation of
expressive behaviours, we propose a novel RPR approach that efficiently
simulates personalised internal cognition from easy-accessible external short
audio-visual behaviours expressed by the target individual. The simulated
personalised cognition, represented as a set of network weights that enforce
the personalised network to reproduce the individual-specific facial reactions,
is further encoded as a novel graph containing two-dimensional node and edge
feature matrices, with a novel 2D Graph Neural Network (2D-GNN) proposed for
inferring real personality traits from it. To simulate real personality-related
cognition, an end-to-end strategy is designed to jointly train our cognition
simulation, 2D graph construction, and personality recognition modules.

### [11] [SAM-PTx: Text-Guided Fine-Tuning of SAM with Parameter-Efficient, Parallel-Text Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00213)
*Shayan Jalilian,Abdul Bais*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM-PTx是一种参数高效的方法，通过冻结的CLIP文本嵌入作为类别级语义引导，改进了SAM的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语义文本提示在分割任务中的潜力，弥补传统空间提示（如点和框）的不足。

Method: 提出轻量级适配器Parallel-Text，将文本嵌入注入SAM的图像编码器，保留大部分原始架构不变。

Result: 在COD10K、COCO和ADE20K数据集上，加入固定文本嵌入的分割性能优于纯空间提示基线。

Conclusion: 将语义条件集成到SAM架构中，为高效适应提供了实用且可扩展的路径。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive generalization
in prompt-based segmentation. Yet, the potential of semantic text prompts
remains underexplored compared to traditional spatial prompts like points and
boxes. This paper introduces SAM-PTx, a parameter-efficient approach for
adapting SAM using frozen CLIP-derived text embeddings as class-level semantic
guidance. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter design called
Parallel-Text that injects text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, enabling
semantics-guided segmentation while keeping most of the original architecture
frozen. Our adapter modifies only the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer
block, preserving the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Through
supervised experiments and ablations on the COD10K dataset as well as low-data
subsets of COCO and ADE20K, we show that incorporating fixed text embeddings as
input improves segmentation performance over purely spatial prompt baselines.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to use text prompts for segmentation
on the COD10K dataset. These results suggest that integrating semantic
conditioning into SAM's architecture offers a practical and scalable path for
efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity.

*Aymane Abdali,Bartosz Boguslawski,Lucas Drumetz,Vincent Gripon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在少样本图像分类中，通过引入对象局部位置信息显著提升性能，Segment Anything Model和无需监督的前景提取方法也能实现大部分改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本图像分类中，图像模糊（如多对象或复杂背景）会显著降低性能，因此需要改进方法。

Method: 利用对象在图像中的局部位置信息，结合Segment Anything Model或无需监督的前景提取方法。

Result: 在基准测试中显著提升了分类性能。

Conclusion: 局部位置信息和简单标注（如单像素）或无需监督的方法能有效提升少样本分类性能。

Abstract: In the domain of Few-Shot Image Classification, operating with as little as
one example per class, the presence of image ambiguities stemming from multiple
objects or complex backgrounds can significantly deteriorate performance. Our
research demonstrates that incorporating additional information about the local
positioning of an object within its image markedly enhances classification
across established benchmarks. More importantly, we show that a significant
fraction of the improvement can be achieved through the use of the Segment
Anything Model, requiring only a pixel of the object of interest to be pointed
out, or by employing fully unsupervised foreground object extraction methods.

### [13] [Guided Depth Map Super-Resolution via Multi-Scale Fusion U-shaped Mamba Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00248)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多尺度融合U形Mamba（MSF-UM）模型，用于深度图超分辨率，结合Mamba的高效状态空间建模能力和多尺度融合结构，显著减少参数并提升重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在处理长距离依赖和全局上下文信息时存在局限，而Transformer的计算复杂度和内存消耗较高，限制了其在高分辨率深度图处理中的应用。

Method: 设计了结合残差密集通道注意力块和Mamba状态空间模块的结构，利用多尺度跨模态融合策略，通过彩色图像的高频纹理信息引导深度图超分辨率。

Result: 模型在多个公开数据集上验证了有效性，显著减少参数的同时提升了重建精度，尤其在大规模深度图超分辨率任务中表现出优秀的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MSF-UM模型通过结合局部特征提取和长距离依赖建模，以及多尺度融合策略，为深度图超分辨率提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Depth map super-resolution technology aims to improve the spatial resolution
of low-resolution depth maps and effectively restore high-frequency detail
information. Traditional convolutional neural network has limitations in
dealing with long-range dependencies and are unable to fully model the global
contextual information in depth maps. Although transformer can model global
dependencies, its computational complexity and memory consumption are
quadratic, which significantly limits its ability to process high-resolution
depth maps. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale fusion U-shaped Mamba
(MSF-UM) model, a novel guided depth map super-resolution framework. The core
innovation of this model is to integrate Mamba's efficient state-space modeling
capabilities into a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by a color
image. The structure combining the residual dense channel attention block and
the Mamba state space module is designed, which combines the local feature
extraction capability of the convolutional layer with the modeling advantage of
the state space model for long-distance dependencies. At the same time, the
model adopts a multi-scale cross-modal fusion strategy to make full use of the
high-frequency texture information from the color image to guide the
super-resolution process of the depth map. Compared with existing mainstream
methods, the proposed MSF-UM significantly reduces the number of model
parameters while achieving better reconstruction accuracy. Extensive
experiments on multiple publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness
of the model, especially showing excellent generalization ability in the task
of large-scale depth map super-resolution.

TL;DR: PointGauss是一种基于点云的实时多目标分割框架，通过高斯泼溅表示实现高效3D分割，解决了现有方法的初始化时间长和多视角一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多目标分割中存在初始化时间长和多视角一致性不足的问题，PointGauss旨在通过点云驱动的高斯原语解码和GPU加速的2D掩码渲染系统解决这些问题。

Method: PointGauss采用点云分割驱动流程，直接解析高斯原语，包括点云高斯原语解码器和GPU加速的2D掩码渲染系统。

Result: 实验表明，PointGauss在多视角mIoU上比现有方法提升1.89%至31.78%，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: PointGauss在3D分割中表现出色，同时提出了新数据集DesktopObjects-360，解决了现有基准的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce PointGauss, a novel point cloud-guided framework for real-time
multi-object segmentation in Gaussian Splatting representations. Unlike
existing methods that suffer from prolonged initialization and limited
multi-view consistency, our approach achieves efficient 3D segmentation by
directly parsing Gaussian primitives through a point cloud segmentation-driven
pipeline. The key innovation lies in two aspects: (1) a point cloud-based
Gaussian primitive decoder that generates 3D instance masks within 1 minute,
and (2) a GPU-accelerated 2D mask rendering system that ensures multi-view
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over
previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving performance gains of 1.89 to
31.78% in multi-view mIoU, while maintaining superior computational efficiency.
To address the limitations of current benchmarks (single-object focus,
inconsistent 3D evaluation, small scale, and partial coverage), we present
DesktopObjects-360, a novel comprehensive dataset for 3D segmentation in
radiance fields, featuring: (1) complex multi-object scenes, (2) globally
consistent 2D annotations, (3) large-scale training data (over 27 thousand 2D
masks), (4) full 360{\deg} coverage, and (5) 3D evaluation masks.

Abstract: Continual learning enables pre-trained generative vision-language models
(VLMs) to incorporate knowledge from new tasks without retraining data from
previous ones. Recent methods update a visual projector to translate visual
information for new tasks, connecting pre-trained vision encoders with large
language models. However, such adjustments may cause the models to prioritize
visual inputs over language instructions, particularly learning tasks with
repetitive types of textual instructions. To address the neglect of language
instructions, we propose a novel framework that grounds the translation of
visual information on instructions for language models. We introduce a mixture
of visual projectors, each serving as a specialized visual-to-language
translation expert based on the given instruction context to adapt to new
tasks. To avoid using experts for irrelevant instruction contexts, we propose
an expert recommendation strategy that reuses experts for tasks similar to
those previously learned. Additionally, we introduce expert pruning to
alleviate interference from the use of experts that cumulatively activated in
previous tasks. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing continual learning approaches
by generating instruction-following responses.

Abstract: Multimodal referring segmentation aims to segment target objects in visual
scenes, such as images, videos, and 3D scenes, based on referring expressions
in text or audio format. This task plays a crucial role in practical
applications requiring accurate object perception based on user instructions.
Over the past decade, it has gained significant attention in the multimodal
community, driven by advances in convolutional neural networks, transformers,
and large language models, all of which have substantially improved multimodal
perception capabilities. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of
multimodal referring segmentation. We begin by introducing this field's
background, including problem definitions and commonly used datasets. Next, we
summarize a unified meta architecture for referring segmentation and review
representative methods across three primary visual scenes, including images,
videos, and 3D scenes. We further discuss Generalized Referring Expression
(GREx) methods to address the challenges of real-world complexity, along with
related tasks and practical applications. Extensive performance comparisons on
standard benchmarks are also provided. We continually track related works at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义对应是计算机视觉中的基础任务，但其在恶劣条件下的鲁棒性研究不足。

Method: 建立包含14种挑战性场景的基准数据集，评估现有方法和模型（如DINO和Stable Diffusion）的鲁棒性。

Result: 现有方法在恶劣条件下表现显著下降；大规模视觉模型提升鲁棒性，但微调会降低相对鲁棒性；DINO优于Stable Diffusion，融合两者效果更佳。

Conclusion: 任务特定的鲁棒性增强策略是必要的，通用数据增强效果有限。

Abstract: Semantic correspondence aims to identify semantically meaningful
relationships between different images and is a fundamental challenge in
computer vision. It forms the foundation for numerous tasks such as 3D
reconstruction, object tracking, and image editing. With the progress of
large-scale vision models, semantic correspondence has achieved remarkable
performance in controlled and high-quality conditions. However, the robustness
of semantic correspondence in challenging scenarios is much less investigated.
In this work, we establish a novel benchmark for evaluating semantic
correspondence in adverse conditions. The benchmark dataset comprises 14
distinct challenging scenarios that reflect commonly encountered imaging
issues, including geometric distortion, image blurring, digital artifacts, and
environmental occlusion. Through extensive evaluations, we provide several key
insights into the robustness of semantic correspondence approaches: (1) All
existing methods suffer from noticeable performance drops under adverse
conditions; (2) Using large-scale vision models can enhance overall robustness,
but fine-tuning on these models leads to a decline in relative robustness; (3)
The DINO model outperforms the Stable Diffusion in relative robustness, and
their fusion achieves better absolute robustness; Moreover, We evaluate common
robustness enhancement strategies for semantic correspondence and find that
general data augmentations are ineffective, highlighting the need for
task-specific designs. These results are consistent across both our dataset and
real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Driver drowsiness is one of the main causes of road accidents and is
recognized as a leading contributor to traffic-related fatalities. However,
detecting drowsiness accurately remains a challenging task, especially in
real-world settings where facial data from different individuals is
decentralized and highly diverse. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
for drowsiness detection that is designed to work effectively with
heterogeneous and decentralized data. Our approach develops a new Spatial
Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
network to better extract key facial features and improve detection
performance. To support federated learning, we employ a Gradient Similarity
Comparison (GSC) that selects the most relevant trained models from different
operators before aggregation. This improves the accuracy and robustness of the
global model while preserving user privacy. We also develop a customized tool
that automatically processes video data by extracting frames, detecting and
cropping faces, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation,
flipping, brightness adjustment, and zooming. Experimental results show that
our framework achieves a detection accuracy of 89.9% in the federated learning
settings, outperforming existing methods under various deployment scenarios.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling
real-world data variability and highlight its potential for deployment in
intelligent transportation systems to enhance road safety through early and
reliable drowsiness detection.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection models in autonomous driving systems often lack
robustness due to insufficient representation of dangerous pedestrian scenarios
in training datasets. To address this limitation, we present a novel framework
for controllable pedestrian video editing in multi-view driving scenarios by
integrating video inpainting and human motion control techniques. Our approach
begins by identifying pedestrian regions of interest across multiple camera
views, expanding detection bounding boxes with a fixed ratio, and resizing and
stitching these regions into a unified canvas while preserving cross-view
spatial relationships. A binary mask is then applied to designate the editable
area, within which pedestrian editing is guided by pose sequence control
conditions. This enables flexible editing functionalities, including pedestrian
insertion, replacement, and removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves high-quality pedestrian editing with strong visual realism,
spatiotemporal coherence, and cross-view consistency. These results establish
the proposed method as a robust and versatile solution for multi-view
pedestrian video generation, with broad potential for applications in data
augmentation and scenario simulation in autonomous driving.

Motivation: 现有条件扩散模型在任务控制上需要大量监督微调，而训练自由引导方法虽避免微调，但存在内存占用高或控制效果不佳的局限，限制了其在计算密集型任务（如T2V）中的应用。

Method: 开发了一种无需反向传播的高效扩散潜变量优化方法，研究了前向梯度下降在引导扩散任务中的应用，并提供了多种方向性指令选项。

Conclusion: TITAN-Guide不仅降低了内存需求，还在多个扩散引导基准测试中显著提升了T2V性能，为计算密集型任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In the recent development of conditional diffusion models still require heavy
supervised fine-tuning for performing control on a category of tasks.
Training-free conditioning via guidance with off-the-shelf models is a
favorable alternative to avoid further fine-tuning on the base model. However,
the existing training-free guidance frameworks either have heavy memory
requirements or offer sub-optimal control due to rough estimation. These
shortcomings limit the applicability to control diffusion models that require
intense computation, such as Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models. In this
work, we propose Taming Inference Time Alignment for Guided Text-to-Video
Diffusion Model, so-called TITAN-Guide, which overcomes memory space issues,
and provides more optimal control in the guidance process compared to the
counterparts. In particular, we develop an efficient method for optimizing
diffusion latents without backpropagation from a discriminative guiding model.
In particular, we study forward gradient descents for guided diffusion tasks
with various options on directional directives. In our experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in efficiently managing memory
during latent optimization, while previous methods fall short. Our proposed
approach not only minimizes memory requirements but also significantly enhances
T2V performance across a range of diffusion guidance benchmarks. Code, models,

TL;DR: 论文提出AerialCSP，一个模拟CSP电厂航拍图像的虚拟数据集，以减少对大量标注数据的需求，并提升模型在真实场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CSP电厂航拍图像具有高反射性和领域特异性，传统数据集训练的模型难以泛化，而标注真实数据成本高且耗时。

Method: 创建AerialCSP虚拟数据集，模拟真实航拍图像，用于模型预训练，并评估其在真实场景中的表现。

Result: AerialCSP显著提升了模型在真实CSP电厂中的缺陷检测能力，尤其是对小而罕见缺陷的识别。

Conclusion: AerialCSP为CSP航拍任务提供了高质量合成数据，减少了对人工标注的依赖，推动了工业应用的快速部署。

Abstract: In the context of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, aerial images
captured by drones present a unique set of challenges. Unlike urban or natural
landscapes commonly found in existing datasets, solar fields contain highly
reflective surfaces, and domain-specific elements that are uncommon in
traditional computer vision benchmarks. As a result, machine learning models
trained on generic datasets struggle to generalize to this setting without
extensive retraining and large volumes of annotated data. However, collecting
and labeling such data is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for
rapid deployment in industrial applications.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: the creation of
AerialCSP, a virtual dataset that simulates aerial imagery of CSP plants. By
generating synthetic data that closely mimic real-world conditions, our
objective is to facilitate pretraining of models before deployment,
significantly reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. Our main
contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce AerialCSP, a high-quality
synthetic dataset for aerial inspection of CSP plants, providing annotated data
for object detection and image segmentation; (2) we benchmark multiple models
on AerialCSP, establishing a baseline for CSP-related vision tasks; and (3) we
demonstrate that pretraining on AerialCSP significantly improves real-world
fault detection, particularly for rare and small defects, reducing the need for
extensive manual labeling. AerialCSP is made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AniMer+是一个扩展的框架，用于通过统一的方法重建哺乳动物和鸟类的姿态与形状，采用高容量的Vision Transformer和Mixture-of-Experts设计，并生成合成数据集以解决数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基础模型时代，通过单一网络实现对不同动态对象的统一理解对空间智能至关重要。同时，准确估计动物姿态和形状对生物研究具有重要意义，但现有方法受限于网络容量和数据稀缺。

Method: AniMer+采用高容量、家族感知的Vision Transformer（ViT）和Mixture-of-Experts（MoE）设计，将网络层分为物种特定和共享组件。通过扩散模型生成合成数据集CtrlAni3D和CtrlAVES3D。

Result: 在41.3k哺乳动物和12.4k鸟类图像（真实与合成数据结合）上训练，AniMer+在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，包括具有挑战性的Animal Kingdom数据集。

Conclusion: AniMer+的网络架构和合成数据集显著提升了实际应用性能，解决了数据稀缺和网络容量限制的问题。

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, achieving a unified understanding of
different dynamic objects through a single network has the potential to empower
stronger spatial intelligence. Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and
shape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in
biological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the
limited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive
multi-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an
extended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a
unified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key
innovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer
(ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture
partitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves)
and taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and
common anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical
shortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a
diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces
two large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for
birds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for
birds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities. Trained on
an aggregated collection of 41.3k mammalian and 12.4k avian images (combining
real and synthetic data), our method demonstrates superior performance over
existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks, including the
challenging out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of both our novel network architecture and the generated
synthetic datasets in enhancing real-world application performance.

Method: 结合SMPL运动序列和视频帧，编码到与自然语言对齐的多模态嵌入空间，通过文本查询检索人类行为及其上下文。

Result: 在WayMoCo数据集上，方法在运动-上下文检索中的准确率比现有技术高27.5%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效支持自动驾驶系统在多样化、以人为中心的场景中的评估。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems must operate reliably in safety-critical
scenarios, particularly those involving unusual or complex behavior by
Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs). Identifying these edge cases in driving datasets
is essential for robust evaluation and generalization, but retrieving such rare
human behavior scenarios within the long tail of large-scale datasets is
challenging. To support targeted evaluation of autonomous driving systems in
diverse, human-centered scenarios, we propose a novel context-aware motion
retrieval framework. Our method combines Skinned Multi-Person Linear
(SMPL)-based motion sequences and corresponding video frames before encoding
them into a shared multimodal embedding space aligned with natural language.
Our approach enables the scalable retrieval of human behavior and their context
through text queries. This work also introduces our dataset WayMoCo, an
extension of the Waymo Open Dataset. It contains automatically labeled motion
and scene context descriptions derived from generated pseudo-ground-truth SMPL
sequences and corresponding image data. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models by up to 27.5% accuracy in motion-context retrieval,
when evaluated on the WayMoCo dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法无法充分建模3D环境与目标图像之间的几何关系，且计算效率低，因此需要一种更高效、3D感知的导航方法。

Method: 提出IGL-Nav框架，通过增量更新3D高斯表示、粗粒度几何匹配和细粒度优化，实现高效目标定位。

Result: IGL-Nav在多种实验配置中大幅超越现有方法，并能处理自由视角图像目标导航，适用于真实机器人平台。

Conclusion: IGL-Nav通过3D感知和高效计算，显著提升了图像目标导航的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging
problem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or
modular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot
fully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and
the goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image
in 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian
(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS
optimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly
leveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is
prohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D
Gaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal
navigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as
new images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely
localize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space
matching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent
is close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization
via differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental
configurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal
setting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to
capture goal image at arbitrary pose. Project page:

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: 通过解耦增强流程和动态对齐策略，有效提升了低光图像增强的性能。

Abstract: The event camera, benefiting from its high dynamic range and low latency,
provides performance gain for low-light image enhancement. Unlike frame-based
cameras, it records intensity changes with extremely high temporal resolution,
capturing sufficient structure information. Currently, existing event-based
methods feed a frame and events directly into a single model without fully
exploiting modality-specific advantages, which limits their performance.
Therefore, by analyzing the role of each sensing modality, the enhancement
pipeline is decoupled into two stages: visibility restoration and structure
refinement. In the first stage, we design a visibility restoration network with
amplitude-phase entanglement by rethinking the relationship between amplitude
and phase components in Fourier space. In the second stage, a fusion strategy
with dynamic alignment is proposed to mitigate the spatial mismatch caused by
the temporal resolution discrepancy between two sensing modalities, aiming to
refine the structure information of the image enhanced by the visibility
restoration network. In addition, we utilize spatial-frequency interpolation to
simulate negative samples with diverse illumination, noise and artifact
degradations, thereby developing a contrastive loss that encourages the model
to learn discriminative representations. Experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a critical role in public safety
applications such as intelligent surveillance. However, the rarity,
unpredictability, and high annotation cost of real-world anomalies make it
difficult to scale VAD datasets, which limits the performance and
generalization ability of existing models. To address this challenge, we
propose a generative video-enhanced weakly-supervised video anomaly detection
(GV-VAD) framework that leverages text-conditioned video generation models to
produce semantically controllable and physically plausible synthetic videos.
These virtual videos are used to augment training data at low cost. In
addition, a synthetic sample loss scaling strategy is utilized to control the
influence of generated synthetic samples for efficient training. The
experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on UCF-Crime datasets. The code is available at

Result: 实验表明，该方法能提升文本对齐和目标分布保真度，且无需额外计算开销。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效平衡生成结果，适用于多种微调策略。

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for adapting the
pre-trained models to specific target concepts, enabling diverse image
generation. However, fine-tuning with few images introduces an inherent
trade-off between aligning with the target distribution (e.g., subject
fidelity) and preserving the broad knowledge of the original model (e.g., text
editability). Existing sampling guidance methods, such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG) and autoguidance (AG), fail to effectively guide the output
toward well-balanced space: CFG restricts the adaptation to the target
distribution, while AG compromises text alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose personalization guidance, a simple yet effective method
leveraging an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt. Moreover,
our method dynamically controls the extent of unlearning in a weak model
through weight interpolation between pre-trained and fine-tuned models during
inference. Unlike existing guidance methods, which depend solely on guidance
scales, our method explicitly steers the outputs toward a balanced latent space
without additional computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed guidance can improve text alignment and target distribution
fidelity, integrating seamlessly with various fine-tuning strategies.

Abstract: This paper introduces a practical and accurate calibration method for camera
spectral sensitivity using a diffraction grating. Accurate calibration of
camera spectral sensitivity is crucial for various computer vision tasks,
including color correction, illumination estimation, and material analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that require specialized narrow-band filters or
reference targets with known spectral reflectances, our method only requires an
uncalibrated diffraction grating sheet, readily available off-the-shelf. By
capturing images of the direct illumination and its diffracted pattern through
the grating sheet, our method estimates both the camera spectral sensitivity

Motivation: 解决多模态推理在多样化数据集和任务格式中的挑战。

Method: 使用PromptEngineer生成任务特定提示，VisionReasoner进行最终推理，框架自动化、模块化且无需训练。

Result: 在18个数据集上评估，Claude 3.7在TQA、DocVQA和MMCoQA任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: LVLMs在多图像推理中表现高效，提示设计和模型选择对性能有显著影响。

Abstract: We present a Collaborative Agent-Based Framework for Multi-Image Reasoning.
Our approach tackles the challenge of interleaved multimodal reasoning across
diverse datasets and task formats by employing a dual-agent system: a
language-based PromptEngineer, which generates context-aware, task-specific
prompts, and a VisionReasoner, a large vision-language model (LVLM) responsible
for final inference. The framework is fully automated, modular, and
training-free, enabling generalization across classification, question
answering, and free-form generation tasks involving one or multiple input
images. We evaluate our method on 18 diverse datasets from the 2025 MIRAGE
Challenge (Track A), covering a broad spectrum of visual reasoning tasks
including document QA, visual comparison, dialogue-based understanding, and
scene-level inference. Our results demonstrate that LVLMs can effectively
reason over multiple images when guided by informative prompts. Notably, Claude
3.7 achieves near-ceiling performance on challenging tasks such as TQA (99.13%
accuracy), DocVQA (96.87%), and MMCoQA (75.28 ROUGE-L). We also explore how
design choices-such as model selection, shot count, and input length-influence
the reasoning performance of different LVLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种速度引导的可学习卡尔曼滤波器（SG-LKF），通过动态调整不确定性建模以适应车辆速度，显著提高了动态场景下的跟踪稳定性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跟踪方法基于静态坐标变换，忽略了车辆速度对观测噪声和参考帧变化的影响，导致高速动态场景下跟踪性能下降。

Method: 提出SG-LKF，结合MotionScaleNet（MSNet）动态预测关键参数，并引入自监督轨迹一致性损失优化帧间关联和轨迹连续性。

Result: SG-LKF在KITTI 2D MOT上以79.59% HOTA排名第一，KITTI 3D MOT上达82.03% HOTA，nuScenes 3D MOT上优于SimpleTrack 2.2% AMOTA。

Conclusion: SG-LKF通过动态适应车辆速度，显著提升了多目标跟踪在动态高速场景下的性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) enables autonomous vehicles to continuously
perceive dynamic objects, supplying essential temporal cues for prediction,
behavior understanding, and safe planning. However, conventional
tracking-by-detection methods typically rely on static coordinate
transformations based on ego-vehicle poses, disregarding ego-vehicle
speed-induced variations in observation noise and reference frame changes,
which degrades tracking stability and accuracy in dynamic, high-speed
scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the critical role of ego-vehicle speed
in MOT and propose a Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter (SG-LKF) that
dynamically adapts uncertainty modeling to ego-vehicle speed, significantly
improving stability and accuracy in highly dynamic scenarios. Central to SG-LKF
is MotionScaleNet (MSNet), a decoupled token-mixing and channel-mixing MLP that
adaptively predicts key parameters of SG-LKF. To enhance inter-frame
association and trajectory continuity, we introduce a self-supervised
trajectory consistency loss jointly optimized with semantic and positional
constraints. Extensive experiments show that SG-LKF ranks first among all
vision-based methods on KITTI 2D MOT with 79.59% HOTA, delivers strong results
on KITTI 3D MOT with 82.03% HOTA, and outperforms SimpleTrack by 2.2% AMOTA on
nuScenes 3D MOT.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的协作感知方法CoST，通过统一时空空间同时聚合多智能体和多时间观测，提高了特征传输效率和融合性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法将多智能体融合和多时间融合分离的问题，提升协作感知的效率和准确性。

Method: 提出协作感知时空变换器（CoST），在统一时空空间中同时聚合多智能体和多时间观测。

Result: CoST在效率和准确性上均有提升，且兼容多数现有方法，减少传输带宽。

Conclusion: CoST通过统一时空空间优化了协作感知，显著提升了性能和应用兼容性。

Abstract: Collaborative perception shares information among different agents and helps
solving problems that individual agents may face, e.g., occlusions and small
sensing range. Prior methods usually separate the multi-agent fusion and
multi-time fusion into two consecutive steps. In contrast, this paper proposes
an efficient collaborative perception that aggregates the observations from
different agents (space) and different times into a unified spatio-temporal
space simultanesouly. The unified spatio-temporal space brings two benefits,
i.e., efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. 1) Efficient
feature transmission: each static object yields a single observation in the
spatial temporal space, and thus only requires transmission only once (whereas
prior methods re-transmit all the object features multiple times). 2) superior
feature fusion: merging the multi-agent and multi-time fusion into a unified
spatial-temporal aggregation enables a more holistic perspective, thereby
enhancing perception performance in challenging scenarios. Consequently, our
Collaborative perception with Spatio-temporal Transformer (CoST) gains
improvement in both efficiency and accuracy. Notably, CoST is not tied to any
specific method and is compatible with a majority of previous methods,
enhancing their accuracy while reducing the transmission bandwidth.

Motivation: 解决蜂蜜植物来源自动分类问题，提高分类准确率和效率。

Method: 1. 数据准备阶段使用类转换方法增强类别可分性；2. 特征提取阶段采用LDA降维；3. 分类阶段使用SVM和KNN模型。

Result: 在标准HSI数据集上，图像分类准确率达95.13%，实例分类准确率达92.80%。

Conclusion: 该方法在蜂蜜植物来源分类中表现优异，达到了先进水平。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method for automatically
classifying honey botanical origins. Dataset preparation, feature extraction,
and classification are the three main steps of the proposed method. We use a
class transformation method in the dataset preparation phase to maximize the
separability across classes. The feature extraction phase employs the Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) technique for extracting relevant features and
reducing the number of dimensions. In the classification phase, we use Support
Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models to classify the
extracted features of honey samples into their botanical origins. We evaluate
our system using a standard honey hyperspectral imaging (HSI) dataset.
Experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed system produces
state-of-the-art results on this dataset, achieving the highest classification
accuracy of 95.13% for hyperspectral image-based classification and 92.80% for
hyperspectral instance-based classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseRecon提出了一种新的稀疏视图神经隐式重建方法，结合体积渲染特征一致性和不确定性引导的深度约束，解决了现有方法在未见视图上泛化能力差或重建质量受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏视图重建方法分为泛化型和过拟合型，前者在未见视图上泛化能力差，后者因几何线索有限导致重建质量受限。

Method: SparseRecon通过特征一致性损失约束神经隐式场，并通过不确定性引导的深度约束补充遮挡和特征不明显区域的几何细节。

Result: 实验表明，SparseRecon在稀疏视图输入下优于现有方法，尤其在视图重叠较少的场景中能生成高质量几何。

Conclusion: SparseRecon通过特征一致性和深度约束的结合，显著提升了稀疏视图重建的质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: Surface reconstruction from sparse views aims to reconstruct a 3D shape or
scene from few RGB images. The latest methods are either generalization-based
or overfitting-based. However, the generalization-based methods do not
generalize well on views that were unseen during training, while the
reconstruction quality of overfitting-based methods is still limited by the
limited geometry clues. To address this issue, we propose SparseRecon, a novel
neural implicit reconstruction method for sparse views with volume
rendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraint.
Firstly, we introduce a feature consistency loss across views to constrain the
neural implicit field. This design alleviates the ambiguity caused by
insufficient consistency information of views and ensures completeness and
smoothness in the reconstruction results. Secondly, we employ an
uncertainty-guided depth constraint to back up the feature consistency loss in
areas with occlusion and insignificant features, which recovers geometry
details for better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which can produce
high-quality geometry with sparse-view input, especially in the scenarios with
small overlapping views. Project page: https://hanl2010.github.io/SparseRecon/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Representation Shift的无训练、模型无关的指标，用于测量每个token表示的变化程度，从而与FlashAttention兼容地实现token压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着任务复杂度的增加，Transformer模型和token数量增长，导致自注意力的二次计算成本和GPU内存访问开销增加。现有token压缩方法依赖注意力图，与FlashAttention不兼容。

Method: 提出Representation Shift指标，无需训练或注意力图，直接测量token表示的变化程度，实现与FlashAttention兼容的token压缩。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视频-文本检索和视频问答任务中分别实现了5.5%和4.4%的显著加速。

Conclusion: Representation Shift是一种高效、兼容FlashAttention的token压缩方法，适用于多种模型，包括Transformer、CNN和状态空间模型。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success across vision, language,
and video. Yet, increasing task complexity has led to larger models and more
tokens, raising the quadratic cost of self-attention and the overhead of GPU
memory access. To reduce the computation cost of self-attention, prior work has
proposed token compression techniques that drop redundant or less informative
tokens. Meanwhile, fused attention kernels such as FlashAttention have been
developed to alleviate memory overhead by avoiding attention map construction
and its associated I/O to HBM. This, however, makes it incompatible with most
training-free token compression methods, which rely on attention maps to
determine token importance. Here, we propose Representation Shift, a
training-free, model-agnostic metric that measures the degree of change in each
token's representation. This seamlessly integrates token compression with
FlashAttention, without attention maps or retraining. Our method further
generalizes beyond Transformers to CNNs and state space models. Extensive
experiments show that Representation Shift enables effective token compression
compatible with FlashAttention, yielding significant speedups of up to 5.5% and
4.4% in video-text retrieval and video QA, respectively. Code is available at

Conclusion: BiAnt有效解决了传统方法的局限性，提升了动作预测性能。

Abstract: Video-based long-term action anticipation is crucial for early risk detection
in areas such as automated driving and robotics. Conventional approaches
extract features from past actions using encoders and predict future events
with decoders, which limits performance due to their unidirectional nature.
These methods struggle to capture semantically distinct sub-actions within a
scene. The proposed method, BiAnt, addresses this limitation by combining
forward prediction with backward prediction using a large language model.
Experimental results on Ego4D demonstrate that BiAnt improves performance in
terms of edit distance compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Weld defect detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of
piping systems in the oil and gas industry, especially in challenging marine
and offshore environments. Traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods
often fail to detect subtle or internal defects, leading to potential failures
and costly downtime. Furthermore, existing neural network-based approaches for
defect classification frequently rely on arbitrarily selected pretrained
architectures and lack interpretability, raising safety concerns for
deployment. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
``Adapt-WeldNet", an adaptive framework for welding defect detection that
systematically evaluates various pre-trained architectures, transfer learning
strategies, and adaptive optimizers to identify the best-performing model and
hyperparameters, optimizing defect detection and providing actionable insights.
Additionally, a novel Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis (DDIA)
framework is proposed to enhance system transparency. DDIA employs Explainable
AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM and LIME, alongside domain-specific
evaluations validated by certified ASNT NDE Level II professionals.
Incorporating a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach and aligning with the
principles of Trustworthy AI, DDIA ensures the reliability, fairness, and
accountability of the defect detection system, fostering confidence in
automated decisions through expert validation. By improving both performance
and interpretability, this work enhances trust, safety, and reliability in
welding defect detection systems, supporting critical operations in offshore
and marine environments.

Method: 提出$MV_{Hybrid}$架构，结合SSMs和ViT，利用负实特征值初始化SSMs以增强低频模式捕捉能力。在相同数据集上预训练并与其他五种架构对比。

Result: 在LOSO评估中，$MV_{Hybrid}$比最佳ViT模型相关性高57%，性能下降小43%，且在分类、检索和生存预测任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: $MV_{Hybrid}$展示了作为下一代病理视觉基础模型骨干的潜力，性能更优且更稳健。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics reveals gene expression patterns within tissue
context, enabling precision oncology applications such as treatment response
prediction, but its high cost and technical complexity limit clinical adoption.
Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology
images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models
(VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below
clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse
whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs
may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating
with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized
with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce
$MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models
(SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for
pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using
the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models
using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same
biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher
correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance
degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction,
demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore,
$MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification,
patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing
its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone. Our code is publicly
available at: https://github.com/deepnoid-ai/MVHybrid.

Conclusion: Cued-Agent通过多智能体协作有效解决了CS识别的多模态融合问题，并在有限数据下表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) is a visual communication system that combines lip-reading
with hand coding to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing
impairments. Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) aims to convert CS hand gestures
and lip movements into text via AI-driven methods. Traditionally, the temporal
asynchrony between hand and lip movements requires the design of complex
modules to facilitate effective multimodal fusion. However, constrained by
limited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity
for adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in
handling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose
the first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It
integrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based
Hand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt
strategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip
Recognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand
Prompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip
features during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction
Phoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from
phoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through
semantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS
dataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a
mixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
Cued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios
compared with state-of-the-art methods. The implementation is available at

Conclusion: DAPT通过解耦与对称对齐有效解决模态信息不对称问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Prompt tuning (PT), as an emerging resource-efficient fine-tuning paradigm,
has showcased remarkable effectiveness in improving the task-specific
transferability of vision-language models. This paper delves into a previously
overlooked information asymmetry issue in PT, where the visual modality mostly
conveys more context than the object-oriented textual modality.
Correspondingly, coarsely aligning these two modalities could result in the
biased attention, driving the model to merely focus on the context area. To
address this, we propose DAPT, an effective PT framework based on an intuitive
decouple-before-align concept. First, we propose to explicitly decouple the
visual modality into the foreground and background representation via
exploiting coarse-and-fine visual segmenting cues, and then both of these
decoupled patterns are aligned with the original foreground texts and the
hand-crafted background classes, thereby symmetrically strengthening the modal
alignment. To further enhance the visual concentration, we propose a visual
pull-push regularization tailored for the foreground-background patterns,
directing the original visual representation towards unbiased attention on the
region-of-interest object. We demonstrate the power of architecture-free DAPT
through few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and data-efficient
learning, all of which yield superior performance across prevailing benchmarks.
Our code will be released at https://github.com/Ferenas/DAPT.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based video generation models has led to
increasingly realistic synthetic content, presenting new challenges for video
forgery detection. Existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained
temporal inconsistencies, particularly in AI-generated videos with high visual
fidelity and coherent motion. In this work, we propose a detection framework
that leverages spatial-temporal consistency by combining RGB appearance
features with optical flow residuals. The model adopts a dual-branch
architecture, where one branch analyzes RGB frames to detect appearance-level
artifacts, while the other processes flow residuals to reveal subtle motion
anomalies caused by imperfect temporal synthesis. By integrating these
complementary features, the proposed method effectively detects a wide range of
forged videos. Extensive experiments on text-to-video and image-to-video tasks
across ten diverse generative models demonstrate the robustness and strong
generalization ability of the proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增加自编码器的潜在通道数能提升重建质量，但会导致扩散模型收敛慢，影响生成质量，限制了潜在扩散模型的质量上限。

Method: 提出结构化潜在空间（训练时对潜在空间施加通道结构）和增强扩散训练（在对象潜在通道上增加扩散训练目标）。

Result: DC-AE 1.5比DC-AE收敛更快且生成质量更高，在ImageNet 512x512上，DC-AE-1.5-f64c128比DC-AE-f32c32生成质量更好且快4倍。

Conclusion: DC-AE 1.5通过结构化潜在空间和增强扩散训练，显著提升了扩散模型的收敛速度和生成质量。

Abstract: We present DC-AE 1.5, a new family of deep compression autoencoders for
high-resolution diffusion models. Increasing the autoencoder's latent channel
number is a highly effective approach for improving its reconstruction quality.
However, it results in slow convergence for diffusion models, leading to poorer
generation quality despite better reconstruction quality. This issue limits the
quality upper bound of latent diffusion models and hinders the employment of
autoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios. We introduce two key
innovations to address this challenge: i) Structured Latent Space, a
training-based approach to impose a desired channel-wise structure on the
latent space with front latent channels capturing object structures and latter
latent channels capturing image details; ii) Augmented Diffusion Training, an
augmented diffusion training strategy with additional diffusion training
objectives on object latent channels to accelerate convergence. With these
techniques, DC-AE 1.5 delivers faster convergence and better diffusion scaling
results than DC-AE. On ImageNet 512x512, DC-AE-1.5-f64c128 delivers better
image generation quality than DC-AE-f32c32 while being 4x faster. Code:

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
generalization across diverse video understanding tasks under zero-shot
settings. However, their capabilities in high-stakes industrial domains-where
recognizing both routine operations and safety-critical anomalies is
essential-remain largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
iSafetyBench, a new video-language benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
model performance in industrial environments across both normal and hazardous
scenarios. iSafetyBench comprises 1,100 video clips sourced from real-world
industrial settings, annotated with open-vocabulary, multi-label action tags
spanning 98 routine and 67 hazardous action categories. Each clip is paired
with multiple-choice questions for both single-label and multi-label
evaluation, enabling fine-grained assessment of VLMs in both standard and
safety-critical contexts. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art video-language
models under zero-shot conditions. Despite their strong performance on existing
video benchmarks, these models struggle with iSafetyBench-particularly in
recognizing hazardous activities and in multi-label scenarios. Our results
reveal significant performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust,
safety-aware multimodal models for industrial applications. iSafetyBench
provides a first-of-its-kind testbed to drive progress in this direction. The

methods, such as those that use pre-trained diffusion models, often struggle to
generate plausible completions in dynamic scenarios because they have a limited
understanding of HOI. To solve this problem, we've developed a new approach
that uses physical prior knowledge along with a specialized multi-regional
inpainting technique designed for HOI. By incorporating physical constraints
from human topology and contact information, we define two distinct regions:
the primary region, where occluded object parts are most likely to be, and the
secondary region, where occlusions are less probable. Our multi-regional
inpainting method uses customized denoising strategies across these regions
within a diffusion model. This improves the accuracy and realism of the
generated completions in both their shape and visual detail. Our experimental
results show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in
HOI scenarios, moving machine perception closer to a more human-like
understanding of dynamic environments. We also show that our pipeline is robust
even without ground-truth contact annotations, which broadens its applicability
to tasks like 3D reconstruction and novel view/pose synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态效率指数（DEI）和多阶段视频恢复框架（PMR），用于解决大气湍流导致的视频质量下降问题，有效恢复边缘细节并消除混合失真。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气湍流引起的几何失真和模糊降低了远距离动态场景视频的质量，现有方法难以在强湍流和复杂动态条件下恢复边缘细节和消除混合失真。

Method: 提出DEI量化视频动态强度，并构建高动态湍流训练数据集；设计PMR框架，包括去倾斜、运动分割增强和去模糊三个阶段，采用轻量级主干和分阶段联合训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效抑制运动拖尾伪影、恢复边缘细节，并在高湍流和复杂动态的真实场景中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在视频恢复质量和效率上表现优异，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Geometric distortions and blurring caused by atmospheric turbulence degrade
the quality of long-range dynamic scene videos. Existing methods struggle with
restoring edge details and eliminating mixed distortions, especially under
conditions of strong turbulence and complex dynamics. To address these
challenges, we introduce a Dynamic Efficiency Index ($DEI$), which combines
turbulence intensity, optical flow, and proportions of dynamic regions to
accurately quantify video dynamic intensity under varying turbulence conditions
and provide a high-dynamic turbulence training dataset. Additionally, we
propose a Physical Model-Driven Multi-Stage Video Restoration ($PMR$) framework
that consists of three stages: \textbf{de-tilting} for geometric stabilization,
\textbf{motion segmentation enhancement} for dynamic region refinement, and
\textbf{de-blurring} for quality restoration. $PMR$ employs lightweight
backbones and stage-wise joint training to ensure both efficiency and high
restoration quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively suppresses motion trailing artifacts, restores edge details and
exhibits strong generalization capability, especially in real-world scenarios
characterized by high-turbulence and complex dynamics. We will make the code
and datasets openly available.

TL;DR: 论文提出TopoTTA，一种针对管状结构分割（TSS）的测试时适应框架，解决域偏移问题，提升拓扑连续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TSS对域偏移敏感，拓扑结构变化和局部特征差异会影响分割完整性。

Method: TopoTTA分两阶段：1）使用TopoMDC适应跨域拓扑差异；2）通过TopoHG生成硬样本并优化伪标签。

Result: 在四个场景和十个数据集上，TopoTTA平均提升31.81%的clDice。

Conclusion: TopoTTA是首个针对TSS的测试时适应框架，可作为CNN模型的即插即用解决方案。

Abstract: Tubular structure segmentation (TSS) is important for various applications,
such as hemodynamic analysis and route navigation. Despite significant progress
in TSS, domain shifts remain a major challenge, leading to performance
degradation in unseen target domains. Unlike other segmentation tasks, TSS is
more sensitive to domain shifts, as changes in topological structures can
compromise segmentation integrity, and variations in local features
distinguishing foreground from background (e.g., texture and contrast) may
further disrupt topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose
Topology-enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (TopoTTA), the first test-time
adaptation framework designed specifically for TSS. TopoTTA consists of two
stages: Stage 1 adapts models to cross-domain topological discrepancies using
the proposed Topological Meta Difference Convolutions (TopoMDCs), which enhance
topological representation without altering pre-trained parameters; Stage 2
improves topological continuity by a novel Topology Hard sample Generation
(TopoHG) strategy and prediction alignment on hard samples with pseudo-labels
in the generated pseudo-break regions. Extensive experiments across four
scenarios and ten datasets demonstrate TopoTTA's effectiveness in handling
topological distribution shifts, achieving an average improvement of 31.81% in
clDice. TopoTTA also serves as a plug-and-play TTA solution for CNN-based TSS
models.

TL;DR: Sortblock是一种无需训练的推理加速框架，通过动态缓存相邻时间步的块级特征，选择性跳过冗余计算，显著提升DiTs的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs的序列去噪过程导致高推理延迟，限制了实时应用。现有方法固定重用中间特征，忽略了去噪阶段和Transformer块的语义变化。

Method: 提出Sortblock框架，基于相邻时间步特征相似性动态缓存块级特征，并通过线性预测机制减少误差。

Result: 实验表明，Sortblock在多种任务和DiT架构中实现2倍以上的推理加速，且输出质量几乎无损。

Conclusion: Sortblock为扩散生成模型提供了一种高效且通用的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities, particularly benefiting from Transformer architectures that
enhance visual and artistic fidelity. However, their inherently sequential
denoising process results in high inference latency, limiting their deployment
in real-time scenarios. Existing training-free acceleration approaches
typically reuse intermediate features at fixed timesteps or layers, overlooking
the evolving semantic focus across denoising stages and Transformer blocks.To
address this, we propose Sortblock, a training-free inference acceleration
framework that dynamically caches block-wise features based on their similarity
across adjacent timesteps. By ranking the evolution of residuals, Sortblock
adaptively determines a recomputation ratio, selectively skipping redundant
computations while preserving generation quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a
lightweight linear prediction mechanism to reduce accumulated errors in skipped
blocks.Extensive experiments across various tasks and DiT architectures
demonstrate that Sortblock achieves over 2$\times$ inference speedup with
minimal degradation in output quality, offering an effective and generalizable
solution for accelerating diffusion-based generative models.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要针对大病灶，忽略了纵向和临床信息，而实际筛查中需要结合时间点和BI-RADS评分。

Method: 提出Temporal Prior Attention（TPA）块动态整合历史与当前扫描信息，以及BI-RADS一致性正则化（BCR）损失嵌入领域知识。

Result: 在内部纵向数据集上，Dice分数比现有单时间点和纵向基线高5%。

Conclusion: 结合时间和临床背景对乳腺癌筛查中的早期病灶分割至关重要。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of small lesions in Breast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced
MRI (DCE-MRI) is critical for early cancer detection, especially in high-risk
patients. While recent deep learning methods have advanced lesion segmentation,
they primarily target large lesions and neglect valuable longitudinal and
clinical information routinely used by radiologists. In real-world screening,
detecting subtle or emerging lesions requires radiologists to compare across
timepoints and consider previous radiology assessments, such as the BI-RADS
score. We propose LesiOnTime, a novel 3D segmentation approach that mimics
clinical diagnostic workflows by jointly leveraging longitudinal imaging and
BIRADS scores. The key components are: (1) a Temporal Prior Attention (TPA)
block that dynamically integrates information from previous and current scans;
and (2) a BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR) loss that enforces latent
space alignment for scans with similar radiological assessments, thus embedding
domain knowledge into the training process. Evaluated on a curated in-house
longitudinal dataset of high-risk patients with DCE-MRI, our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art single-timepoint and longitudinal baselines by 5%
in terms of Dice. Ablation studies demonstrate that both TPA and BCR contribute
complementary performance gains. These results highlight the importance of
incorporating temporal and clinical context for reliable early lesion
segmentation in real-world breast cancer screening. Our code is publicly

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的视频外绘方法，通过引入分层判别器和专用损失函数，解决了现有方法在扩展视频边界时模糊的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频外绘的挑战在于扩展边界时保持内容一致性，现有方法直接应用修复模型效果不佳。

Method: 提出分层判别器，区分全局和局部目标，并设计专用外绘损失函数。

Result: 方法在定量和定性上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过改进判别器和损失函数，显著提升了视频外绘的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Video outpainting presents a unique challenge of extending the borders while
maintaining consistency with the given content. In this paper, we suggest the
use of video inpainting models that excel in object flow learning and
reconstruction in outpainting rather than solely generating the background as
in existing methods. However, directly applying or fine-tuning inpainting
models to outpainting has shown to be ineffective, often leading to blurry
results. Our extensive experiments on discriminator designs reveal that a
critical component missing in the outpainting fine-tuning process is a
discriminator capable of effectively assessing the perceptual quality of the
extended areas. To tackle this limitation, we differentiate the objectives of
adversarial training into global and local goals and introduce a hierarchical
discriminator that meets both objectives. Additionally, we develop a
specialized outpainting loss function that leverages both local and global
features of the discriminator. Fine-tuning on this adversarial loss function
enhances the generator's ability to produce both visually appealing and
globally coherent outpainted scenes. Our proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Supplementary
materials including the demo video and the code are available in SigPort.

TL;DR: 提出首个基于Mamba的水下实例分割模型UIS-Mamba，通过动态树扫描（DTS）和隐藏状态弱化（HSW）模块解决水下场景的特殊挑战，实现了高性能和低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下实例分割任务在复杂水下场景检测中至关重要，但现有方法因水下颜色失真和边界模糊等问题难以保持实例连续性，且复杂背景会干扰实例理解。

Method: 设计了动态树扫描（DTS）模块，通过动态偏移和缩放保持实例内部连续性；隐藏状态弱化（HSW）模块通过Ncut机制抑制背景干扰。

Result: 在UIIS和USIS10K数据集上达到最优性能，同时保持低参数量和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: UIS-Mamba成功将Mamba模型迁移至水下任务，解决了实例连续性和背景干扰问题，为水下实例分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Underwater Instance Segmentation (UIS) tasks are crucial for underwater
complex scene detection. Mamba, as an emerging state space model with
inherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable
for processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features. However,
due to the particularity of underwater scenes, there are many challenges in
applying Mamba to UIS. The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot
maintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of
severely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the
hidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the
understanding of instance objects. In this work, we propose the first
Mamba-based underwater instance segmentation model UIS-Mamba, and design two
innovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), to
migrate Mamba to the underwater task. DTS module maintains the continuity of
the internal features of the instance objects by allowing the patches to
dynamically offset and scale, thereby guiding the minimum spanning tree and
providing dynamic local receptive fields. HSW module suppresses the
interference of complex backgrounds and effectively focuses the information
flow of state propagation to the instances themselves through the Ncut-based
hidden state weakening mechanism. Experimental results show that UIS-Mamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both UIIS and USIS10K datasets, while
maintaining a low number of parameters and computational complexity. Code is

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的NSFW检测框架Wukong，利用扩散模型早期去噪步骤的中间输出和预训练的交叉注意力参数，实现了高效且准确的检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有外部保障方法（文本过滤器和图像过滤器）存在效率低或易受攻击的问题，需要一种更高效且准确的NSFW内容检测方法。

Method: Wukong框架利用扩散模型早期去噪步骤的中间输出和预训练的交叉注意力参数，在图像生成过程中进行早期检测。

Result: Wukong在性能上显著优于基于文本的保障方法，并与图像过滤器精度相当，同时效率更高。

Conclusion: Wukong为NSFW内容检测提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，适用于现代T2I系统。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is a popular AI-generated content (AIGC)
technology enabling diverse and creative image synthesis. However, some outputs
may contain Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content (e.g., violence), violating
community guidelines. Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known
as external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into
two types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I
model-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image
filters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly
and introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems
like Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a
U-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1)
early denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2)
cross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image
regions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW
detection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising
steps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong
operates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting
for full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts,
seeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two
public benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms
text-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while
offering much greater efficiency.

Result: 实验显示现有模型在EgoMask上表现差，但使用EgoMask-Train微调后显著提升。

Conclusion: EgoMask为第一人称视频理解提供了关键资源和见解。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal video grounding aims to localize target entities in videos
based on textual queries. While existing research has made significant progress
in exocentric videos, the egocentric setting remains relatively underexplored,
despite its growing importance in applications such as augmented reality and
robotics. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of the discrepancies
between egocentric and exocentric videos, revealing key challenges such as
shorter object durations, sparser trajectories, smaller object sizes, and
larger positional shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce EgoMask,
the first pixel-level benchmark for fine-grained spatiotemporal grounding in
egocentric videos. It is constructed by our proposed automatic annotation
pipeline, which annotates referring expressions and object masks across short-,
medium-, and long-term videos. Additionally, we create EgoMask-Train, a
large-scale training dataset to facilitate model development. Experiments
demonstrate that the state-of-the-art spatiotemporal grounding models perform
poorly on our benchmark EgoMask, but fine-tuning on EgoMask-Train yields
significant improvements, while preserving performance on exocentric datasets.
Our work thus provides essential resources and insights for advancing
egocentric video understanding. Our code is available at

Conclusion: SDMatte通过扩散模型的先验和视觉提示驱动交互能力，有效提升了交互式抠图的性能。

Abstract: Recent interactive matting methods have shown satisfactory performance in
capturing the primary regions of objects, but they fall short in extracting
fine-grained details in edge regions. Diffusion models trained on billions of
image-text pairs, demonstrate exceptional capability in modeling highly complex
data distributions and synthesizing realistic texture details, while exhibiting
robust text-driven interaction capabilities, making them an attractive solution
for interactive matting. To this end, we propose SDMatte, a diffusion-driven
interactive matting model, with three key contributions. First, we exploit the
powerful priors of diffusion models and transform the text-driven interaction
capability into visual prompt-driven interaction capability to enable
interactive matting. Second, we integrate coordinate embeddings of visual
prompts and opacity embeddings of target objects into U-Net, enhancing
SDMatte's sensitivity to spatial position information and opacity information.
Third, we propose a masked self-attention mechanism that enables the model to
focus on areas specified by visual prompts, leading to better performance.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance
of our method, validating its effectiveness in interactive matting. Our code

TL;DR: AutoDebias是一个自动识别和减轻文本到图像（T2I）模型中社会偏见的框架，无需预先了解具体偏见类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I模型常表现出未提及的社会偏见（如性别或种族刻板印象），现有方法难以处理复杂或重叠的偏见。

Method: AutoDebias利用视觉语言模型检测偏见模式，生成包容性替代提示，并通过CLIP引导训练优化输出公平性。

Result: 在25种偏见场景中，AutoDebias检测准确率达91.6%，将偏见输出从90%降至可忽略水平，同时保持图像质量。

Conclusion: AutoDebias能有效处理复杂偏见，显著提升T2I模型的公平性，且不影响其生成质量。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models generate high-quality images from text prompts but
often exhibit unintended social biases, such as gender or racial stereotypes,
even when these attributes are not mentioned. Existing debiasing methods work
well for simple or well-known cases but struggle with subtle or overlapping
biases. We propose AutoDebias, a framework that automatically identifies and
mitigates harmful biases in T2I models without prior knowledge of specific bias
types. Specifically, AutoDebias leverages vision-language models to detect
biased visual patterns and constructs fairness guides by generating inclusive
alternative prompts that reflect balanced representations. These guides drive a
CLIP-guided training process that promotes fairer outputs while preserving the
original model's image quality and diversity. Unlike existing methods,
AutoDebias effectively addresses both subtle stereotypes and multiple
interacting biases. We evaluate the framework on a benchmark covering over 25
bias scenarios, including challenging cases where multiple biases occur
simultaneously. AutoDebias detects harmful patterns with 91.6% accuracy and
reduces biased outputs from 90% to negligible levels, while preserving the
visual fidelity of the original model.

Conclusion: CLIPTime展示了视觉语言模型在生物监测应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding the temporal dynamics of biological growth is critical across
diverse fields such as microbiology, agriculture, and biodegradation research.
Although vision-language models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining
(CLIP) have shown strong capabilities in joint visual-textual reasoning, their
effectiveness in capturing temporal progression remains limited. To address
this, we propose CLIPTime, a multimodal, multitask framework designed to
predict both the developmental stage and the corresponding timestamp of fungal
growth from image and text inputs. Built upon the CLIP architecture, our model
learns joint visual-textual embeddings and enables time-aware inference without
requiring explicit temporal input during testing. To facilitate training and
evaluation, we introduce a synthetic fungal growth dataset annotated with
aligned timestamps and categorical stage labels. CLIPTime jointly performs
classification and regression, predicting discrete growth stages alongside
continuous timestamps. We also propose custom evaluation metrics, including
temporal accuracy and regression error, to assess the precision of time-aware
predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that CLIPTime effectively models
biological progression and produces interpretable, temporally grounded outputs,
highlighting the potential of vision-language models in real-world biological
monitoring applications.

Motivation: 多光谱和高光谱图像融合任务因光谱与空间信息的权衡及数据不对齐而具有不适定性，现有方法未能有效解决这一问题。

Method: 提出PIF-Net框架，结合不适定先验和可逆Mamba架构，设计Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation模块动态校准特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，PIF-Net的图像恢复性能显著优于现有方法，同时保持模型高效。

Conclusion: PIF-Net通过创新架构和模块设计，有效解决了图像融合的不适定问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: The goal of multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion (MHIF) is to
generate high-quality images that simultaneously possess rich spectral
information and fine spatial details. However, due to the inherent trade-off
between spectral and spatial information and the limited availability of
observations, this task is fundamentally ill-posed. Previous studies have not
effectively addressed the ill-posed nature caused by data misalignment. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a fusion framework named PIF-Net, which
explicitly incorporates ill-posed priors to effectively fuse multispectral
images and hyperspectral images. To balance global spectral modeling with
computational efficiency, we design a method based on an invertible Mamba
architecture that maintains information consistency during feature
transformation and fusion, ensuring stable gradient flow and process
reversibility. Furthermore, we introduce a novel fusion module called the
Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module, which dynamically calibrates spectral
and spatial features while keeping the model lightweight. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PIF-Net achieves significantly
better image restoration performance than current state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining model efficiency.

detection methodologies remain limited by their insufficient exploration of
temporal artifacts in synthetic videos. To bridge this gap, we establish a
theoretical framework through second-order dynamical analysis under Newtonian
mechanics, subsequently extending the Second-order Central Difference features
tailored for temporal artifact detection. Building on this theoretical
foundation, we reveal a fundamental divergence in second-order feature
distributions between real and AI-generated videos. Concretely, we propose
Detection by Difference of Differences (D3), a novel training-free detection
method that leverages the above second-order temporal discrepancies. We
validate the superiority of our D3 on 4 open-source datasets (Gen-Video,
VideoPhy, EvalCrafter, VidProM), 40 subsets in total. For example, on GenVideo,
D3 outperforms the previous best method by 10.39% (absolute) mean Average
Precision. Additional experiments on time cost and post-processing operations
demonstrate D3's exceptional computational efficiency and strong robust
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zig-HS/D3.

Result: SeTe-VSR在细节恢复和感知质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SeTe-VSR有效解决了复杂视频超分辨率任务中的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video super-resolution (VSR) models have demonstrated
impressive results in enhancing low-resolution videos. However, due to
limitations in adequately controlling the generation process, achieving high
fidelity alignment with the low-resolution input while maintaining temporal
consistency across frames remains a significant challenge. In this work, we
propose Semantic and Temporal Guided Video Super-Resolution (SeTe-VSR), a novel
approach that incorporates both semantic and temporal-spatio guidance in the
latent diffusion space to address these challenges. By incorporating high-level
semantic information and integrating spatial and temporal information, our
approach achieves a seamless balance between recovering intricate details and
ensuring temporal coherence. Our method not only preserves high-reality visual
content but also significantly enhances fidelity. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SeTe-VSR outperforms existing methods in terms of detail
recovery and perceptual quality, highlighting its effectiveness for complex
video super-resolution tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在RGB或深度域中使用欧几里得表示，难以捕捉事件的层次结构和时空连续性。

Method: 提出HyPCV-Former，利用双曲空间嵌入特征，并引入双曲多头自注意力机制建模时空动态。

Result: 在TIMo和DAD数据集上分别实现了7%和5.6%的性能提升。

Conclusion: HyPCV-Former在异常检测任务中表现出色，优于现有基准方法。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection is a fundamental task in video surveillance, with
broad applications in public safety and intelligent monitoring systems.
Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth
domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event
structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we
propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for
anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts
per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud
extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better
captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal
dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism
that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn
temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all
feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian
space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across
multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a
5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released
upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: LAMIC是一个无需训练的多参考图像合成框架，通过两种注意力机制实现布局感知生成，并在多个指标上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多参考图像合成中布局一致性和实体解耦的挑战。

Method: 基于MMDiT模型，引入Group Isolation Attention (GIA)和Region-Modulated Attention (RMA)两种注意力机制。

Result: 在ID-S、BG-S、IN-R和AVG等指标上优于现有基线，展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: LAMIC为可控多图像合成提供了一种无需训练的新范式，具有强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: In controllable image synthesis, generating coherent and consistent images
from multiple references with spatial layout awareness remains an open
challenge. We present LAMIC, a Layout-Aware Multi-Image Composition framework
that, for the first time, extends single-reference diffusion models to
multi-reference scenarios in a training-free manner. Built upon the MMDiT
model, LAMIC introduces two plug-and-play attention mechanisms: 1) Group
Isolation Attention (GIA) to enhance entity disentanglement; and 2)
Region-Modulated Attention (RMA) to enable layout-aware generation. To
comprehensively evaluate model capabilities, we further introduce three
metrics: 1) Inclusion Ratio (IN-R) and Fill Ratio (FI-R) for assessing layout
control; and 2) Background Similarity (BG-S) for measuring background
consistency. Extensive experiments show that LAMIC achieves state-of-the-art
performance across most major metrics: it consistently outperforms existing
multi-reference baselines in ID-S, BG-S, IN-R and AVG scores across all
settings, and achieves the best DPG in complex composition tasks. These results
demonstrate LAMIC's superior abilities in identity keeping, background
preservation, layout control, and prompt-following, all achieved without any
training or fine-tuning, showcasing strong zero-shot generalization ability. By
inheriting the strengths of advanced single-reference models and enabling
seamless extension to multi-image scenarios, LAMIC establishes a new
training-free paradigm for controllable multi-image composition. As foundation
models continue to evolve, LAMIC's performance is expected to scale
accordingly. Our implementation is available at:

Conclusion: 研究强调了在虚拟化身通信系统中开发更先进行为生物特征防御的紧迫性，并提供了公开的基准和系统。

Abstract: Photorealistic talking-head avatars are becoming increasingly common in
virtual meetings, gaming, and social platforms. These avatars allow for more
immersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One
emerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can steal a user's
avatar-preserving their appearance and voice-making it nearly impossible to
detect its fraudulent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we explore
the challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our
main question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as
reliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's
visual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we
introduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a
state-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and
impostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable
spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal
attention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial
gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable
meaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%. The proposed
benchmark and biometric system are available for the research community in
order to bring attention to the urgent need for more advanced behavioral
biometric defenses in avatar-based communication systems.

Abstract: Machine learning for remote sensing imaging relies on up-to-date and accurate
labels for model training and testing. Labelling remote sensing imagery is time
and cost intensive, requiring expert analysis. Previous labelling tools rely on
pre-labelled data for training in order to label new unseen data. In this work,
we define an unsupervised pipeline for finding and labelling geographical areas
of similar context and content within Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Our
approach removes limitations of previous methods by utilising segmentation with
convolutional and graph neural networks to encode a more robust feature space
for image comparison. Unlike previous approaches we segment the image into
homogeneous regions of pixels that are grouped based on colour and spatial
similarity. Graph neural networks are used to aggregate information about the
surrounding segments enabling the feature representation to encode the local
neighbourhood whilst preserving its own local information. This reduces
outliers in the labelling tool, allows users to label at a granular level, and
allows a rotationally invariant semantic relationship at the image level to be
formed within the encoding space.

Motivation: 医学图像翻译在处理分布外样本时性能下降，现有方法未能动态调整以适应不同样本。

Result: 在低剂量CT去噪和T1到T2 MRI翻译任务中表现优于基线模型和现有TTA方法。

Conclusion: 动态样本特定调整是提高模型鲁棒性的有效途径。

Abstract: Image-to-image translation has emerged as a powerful technique in medical
imaging, enabling tasks such as image denoising and cross-modality conversion.
However, it suffers from limitations in handling out-of-distribution samples
without causing performance degradation. To address this limitation, we propose
a novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework that dynamically adjusts the
translation process based on the characteristics of each test sample. Our
method introduces a Reconstruction Module to quantify the domain shift and a
Dynamic Adaptation Block that selectively modifies the internal features of a
pretrained translation model to mitigate the shift without compromising the
performance on in-distribution samples that do not require adaptation. We
evaluate our approach on two medical image-to-image translation tasks: low-dose
CT denoising and T1 to T2 MRI translation, showing consistent improvements over
both the baseline translation model without TTA and prior TTA methods. Our
analysis highlights the limitations of the state-of-the-art that uniformly
apply the adaptation to both out-of-distribution and in-distribution samples,
demonstrating that dynamic, sample-specific adjustment offers a promising path
to improve model resilience in real-world scenarios. The code is available at:

Motivation: 水下鱼类检测面临低分辨率、背景干扰和目标视觉相似性等挑战，现有方法常因复杂注意力机制导致模型效率低下。

Method: EPANet包含高效路径聚合特征金字塔网络（EPA-FPN）和多尺度多样化短路径瓶颈（MS-DDSP瓶颈），前者通过长距离跳跃连接提升特征互补性，后者通过细粒度特征分割增强局部多样性。

Result: 在基准数据集上，EPANet在检测精度和推理速度上优于现有方法，同时保持较低参数复杂度。

Conclusion: EPANet通过高效特征集成和多样化局部特征处理，实现了轻量级且高性能的水下鱼类检测。

Abstract: Underwater fish detection (UFD) remains a challenging task in computer vision
due to low object resolution, significant background interference, and high
visual similarity between targets and surroundings. Existing approaches
primarily focus on local feature enhancement or incorporate complex attention
mechanisms to highlight small objects, often at the cost of increased model
complexity and reduced efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose an
efficient path aggregation network (EPANet), which leverages complementary
feature integration to achieve accurate and lightweight UFD. EPANet consists of
two key components: an efficient path aggregation feature pyramid network
(EPA-FPN) and a multi-scale diverse-division short path bottleneck (MS-DDSP
bottleneck). The EPA-FPN introduces long-range skip connections across
disparate scales to improve semantic-spatial complementarity, while cross-layer
fusion paths are adopted to enhance feature integration efficiency. The MS-DDSP
bottleneck extends the conventional bottleneck structure by introducing
finer-grained feature division and diverse convolutional operations, thereby
increasing local feature diversity and representation capacity. Extensive
experiments on benchmark UFD datasets demonstrate that EPANet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and inference speed,
while maintaining comparable or even lower parameter complexity.

<details>

Motivation: 视频色彩分级通常需要专业技能，本文旨在简化这一过程，使其更易用。

Method: 使用扩散模型生成LUT，对齐参考场景与输入视频的色彩属性，并通过文本提示调整低层特征。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，该方法在保持视频结构细节的同时实现了快速推理。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效简化了视频色彩分级，支持用户自定义调整。

Abstract: Different from color correction and transfer, color grading involves
adjusting colors for artistic or storytelling purposes in a video, which is
used to establish a specific look or mood. However, due to the complexity of
the process and the need for specialized editing skills, video color grading
remains primarily the domain of professional colorists. In this paper, we
present a reference-based video color grading framework. Our key idea is
explicitly generating a look-up table (LUT) for color attribute alignment
between reference scenes and input video via a diffusion model. As a training
objective, we enforce that high-level features of the reference scenes like
look, mood, and emotion should be similar to that of the input video. Our
LUT-based approach allows for color grading without any loss of structural
details in the whole video frames as well as achieving fast inference. We
further build a pipeline to incorporate a user-preference via text prompts for
low-level feature enhancement such as contrast and brightness, etc.
Experimental results, including extensive user studies, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach for video color grading. Codes are publicly
available at https://github.com/seunghyuns98/VideoColorGrading.

Motivation: 临床决策依赖解剖结构的相对位置信息，但VLMs在此任务上的能力尚未充分研究。

Method: 评估了GPT-4o、Llama3.2等先进VLMs，并测试了视觉提示（如标记）的效果。

Result: 所有模型均表现不佳，视觉提示仅带来有限改进，医学图像表现显著低于自然图像。

Conclusion: VLMs在医学图像中更依赖先验知识而非图像内容，需进一步研究；MIRP数据集为此提供了工具。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies heavily on understanding relative positions
of anatomical structures and anomalies. Therefore, for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to be applicable in clinical practice, the ability to accurately
determine relative positions on medical images is a fundamental prerequisite.
Despite its importance, this capability remains highly underexplored. To
address this gap, we evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art VLMs, GPT-4o,
Llama3.2, Pixtral, and JanusPro, and find that all models fail at this
fundamental task. Inspired by successful approaches in computer vision, we
investigate whether visual prompts, such as alphanumeric or colored markers
placed on anatomical structures, can enhance performance. While these markers
provide moderate improvements, results remain significantly lower on medical
images compared to observations made on natural images. Our evaluations suggest
that, in medical imaging, VLMs rely more on prior anatomical knowledge than on
actual image content for answering relative position questions, often leading
to incorrect conclusions. To facilitate further research in this area, we
introduce the MIRP , Medical Imaging Relative Positioning, benchmark dataset,
designed to systematically evaluate the capability to identify relative
positions in medical images.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to remarkable success
across a wide range of tasks. However, their susceptibility to adversarial
perturbations remains a critical vulnerability. Existing diffusion-based
adversarial purification methods often require intensive iterative denoising,
severely limiting their practical deployment. In this paper, we propose
Diffusion Bridge Distillation for Purification (DBLP), a novel and efficient
diffusion-based framework for adversarial purification. Central to our approach
is a new objective, noise bridge distillation, which constructs a principled
alignment between the adversarial noise distribution and the clean data
distribution within a latent consistency model (LCM). To further enhance
semantic fidelity, we introduce adaptive semantic enhancement, which fuses
multi-scale pyramid edge maps as conditioning input to guide the purification
process. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DBLP
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust accuracy, superior image quality, and
around 0.2s inference time, marking a significant step toward real-time
adversarial purification.

Conclusion: HiPrune是一种高效、通用的令牌剪枝方法，适用于多种视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) encode images into lengthy sequences of visual
tokens, leading to excessive computational overhead and limited inference
efficiency. While prior efforts prune or merge tokens to address this issue,
they often rely on special tokens (e.g., CLS) or require task-specific
training, hindering scalability across architectures. In this paper, we propose
HiPrune, a training-free and model-agnostic token Pruning framework that
exploits the Hierarchical attention structure within vision encoders. We
identify that middle layers attend to object-centric regions, while deep layers
capture global contextual features. Based on this observation, HiPrune selects
three types of informative tokens: (1) Anchor tokens with high attention in
object-centric layers, (2) Buffer tokens adjacent to anchors for spatial
continuity, and (3) Register tokens with strong attention in deep layers for
global summarization. Our method requires no retraining and integrates
seamlessly with any ViT-based VLM. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-1.5,
LLaVA-NeXT, and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that HiPrune achieves state-of-the-art
pruning performance, preserving up to 99.3% task accuracy with only 33.3%
tokens, and maintaining 99.5% accuracy with just 11.1% tokens. Meanwhile, it
reduces inference FLOPs and latency by up to 9$\times$, showcasing strong
generalization across models and tasks. Code is available at

Conclusion: FreeCP有效解决了开放词汇语义分割中的关键挑战，并展示了其作为即插即用模块的实用性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models has emerged as a powerful
approach for enhancing open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However,
the substantial computational and resource demands associated with training on
large datasets have prompted interest in training-free methods for OVSS.
Existing training-free approaches primarily focus on modifying model
architectures and generating prototypes to improve segmentation performance.
However, they often neglect the challenges posed by class redundancy, where
multiple categories are not present in the current test image, and
visual-language ambiguity, where semantic similarities among categories create
confusion in class activation. These issues can lead to suboptimal class
activation maps and affinity-refined activation maps. Motivated by these
observations, we propose FreeCP, a novel training-free class purification
framework designed to address these challenges. FreeCP focuses on purifying
semantic categories and rectifying errors caused by redundancy and ambiguity.
The purified class representations are then leveraged to produce final
segmentation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments across eight
benchmarks to validate FreeCP's effectiveness. Results demonstrate that FreeCP,
as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosts segmentation performance when
combined with other OVSS methods.

Abstract: Articulated objects are an important type of interactable objects in everyday
environments. In this paper, we propose PhysNAP, a novel diffusion model-based
approach for generating articulated objects that aligns them with partial point
clouds and improves their physical plausibility. The model represents part
shapes by signed distance functions (SDFs). We guide the reverse diffusion
process using a point cloud alignment loss computed using the predicted SDFs.
Additionally, we impose non-penetration and mobility constraints based on the
part SDFs for guiding the model to generate more physically plausible objects.
We also make our diffusion approach category-aware to further improve point
cloud alignment if category information is available. We evaluate the
generative ability and constraint consistency of samples generated with PhysNAP
using the PartNet-Mobility dataset. We also compare it with an unguided
baseline diffusion model and demonstrate that PhysNAP can improve constraint
consistency and provides a tradeoff with generative ability.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for object detection rely on annotated
bounding boxes of large data sets for training. However, obtaining such
annotations is expensive and can require up to hundreds of hours of manual
labor. This poses a challenge, especially since such annotations can only be
provided by experts, as they require knowledge about the scientific domain. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a domain-specific weakly supervised object
detection algorithm that only relies on image-level annotations, which are
significantly easier to acquire. Our method distills the knowledge of a
pre-trained model, on the task of predicting the presence or absence of a virus
in an image, to obtain a set of pseudo-labels that can be used to later train a
state-of-the-art object detection model. To do so, we use an optimization
approach with a shrinking receptive field to extract virus particles directly
without specific network architectures. Through a set of extensive studies, we
show how the proposed pseudo-labels are easier to obtain, and, more
importantly, are able to outperform other existing weak labeling methods, and
even ground truth labels, in cases where the time to obtain the annotation is
limited.

*Jingchao Xie,Oussema Dhaouadi,Weirong Chen,Johannes Meier,Jacques Kaiser,Daniel Cremers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CoProU-VO的新方法，通过跨帧不确定性传播改进无监督视觉里程计，解决了动态场景中静态假设失效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态物体破坏了静态场景假设，导致无监督视觉里程计（VO）的位姿估计错误，传统方法仅考虑单帧信息，忽略了跨帧的不确定性。

Method: 提出CoProU-VO方法，结合目标帧和参考帧的不确定性，采用概率公式进行跨帧传播，基于视觉Transformer同时学习深度、不确定性估计和相机位姿。

Result: 在KITTI和nuScenes数据集上表现优于现有无监督单目端到端方法，尤其在高速公路场景中效果显著。

Conclusion: 跨帧不确定性传播能有效提升无监督VO在动态场景中的性能，CoProU-VO方法具有优越性。

Abstract: Visual Odometry (VO) is fundamental to autonomous navigation, robotics, and
augmented reality, with unsupervised approaches eliminating the need for
expensive ground-truth labels. However, these methods struggle when dynamic
objects violate the static scene assumption, leading to erroneous pose
estimations. We tackle this problem by uncertainty modeling, which is a
commonly used technique that creates robust masks to filter out dynamic objects
and occlusions without requiring explicit motion segmentation. Traditional
uncertainty modeling considers only single-frame information, overlooking the
uncertainties across consecutive frames. Our key insight is that uncertainty
must be propagated and combined across temporal frames to effectively identify
unreliable regions, particularly in dynamic scenes. To address this challenge,
we introduce Combined Projected Uncertainty VO (CoProU-VO), a novel end-to-end
approach that combines target frame uncertainty with projected reference frame
uncertainty using a principled probabilistic formulation. Built upon vision
transformer backbones, our model simultaneously learns depth, uncertainty
estimation, and camera poses. Consequently, experiments on the KITTI and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate significant improvements over previous
unsupervised monocular end-to-end two-frame-based methods and exhibit strong
performance in challenging highway scenes where other approaches often fail.
Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
cross-frame uncertainty propagation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不确定性感知的似然比估计方法，用于区分语义分割模型中的已知和未知像素特征，显著降低了误报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在复杂场景中难以区分罕见类别与未知对象的问题。

Method: 使用证据分类器结合似然比检验，并显式考虑不确定性，输出概率分布而非点估计。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，平均误报率最低（2.5%），平均精度高（90.91%），计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模不确定性，有效提升了未知对象检测的准确性。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation models trained on known object classes often fail in
real-world autonomous driving scenarios by confidently misclassifying unknown
objects. While pixel-wise out-of-distribution detection can identify unknown
objects, existing methods struggle in complex scenes where rare object classes
are often confused with truly unknown objects. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware likelihood ratio estimation method that addresses these
limitations. Our approach uses an evidential classifier within a likelihood
ratio test to distinguish between known and unknown pixel features from a
semantic segmentation model, while explicitly accounting for uncertainty.
Instead of producing point estimates, our method outputs probability
distributions that capture uncertainty from both rare training examples and
imperfect synthetic outliers. We show that by incorporating uncertainty in this
way, outlier exposure can be leveraged more effectively. Evaluated on five
standard benchmark datasets, our method achieves the lowest average false
positive rate (2.5%) among state-of-the-art while maintaining high average
precision (90.91%) and incurring only negligible computational overhead. Code

*Yihe Tian,Kwan Man Cheng,Zhengbo Zhang,Tao Zhang,Suju Li,Dongmei Yan,Bing Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的夜间灯光（NTL）重建框架EVAL，解决了现有方法低估光强度和结构缺失的问题，将VIIRS数据时间序列扩展到1986年，显著提升了精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIIRS数据始于2012年，限制了长期时间序列研究，且当前方法存在光强度低估和结构缺失的缺陷。

Method: 采用两阶段重建框架：构建阶段使用分层融合解码器（HFD）提升初始重建保真度；细化阶段利用双特征细化器（DFR）结合高分辨率不透水面掩模增强细节。

Result: EVAL产品将VIIRS数据扩展到1986年，R²从0.68提升至0.80，RMSE从1.27降至0.99，并保持了良好的时间一致性和社会经济参数相关性。

Conclusion: EVAL为研究社区提供了高质量的长期NTL数据集，解决了现有方法的不足，适用于长期分析。

Abstract: Artificial Night-Time Light (NTL) remote sensing is a vital proxy for
quantifying the intensity and spatial distribution of human activities.
Although the NPP-VIIRS sensor provides high-quality NTL observations, its
temporal coverage, which begins in 2012, restricts long-term time-series
studies that extend to earlier periods. Despite the progress in extending
VIIRS-like NTL time-series, current methods still suffer from two significant
shortcomings: the underestimation of light intensity and the structural
omission. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel reconstruction
framework consisting of a two-stage process: construction and refinement. The
construction stage features a Hierarchical Fusion Decoder (HFD) designed to
enhance the fidelity of the initial reconstruction. The refinement stage
employs a Dual Feature Refiner (DFR), which leverages high-resolution
impervious surface masks to guide and enhance fine-grained structural details.
Based on this framework, we developed the Extended VIIRS-like Artificial
Nighttime Light (EVAL) product for China, extending the standard data record
backwards by 26 years to begin in 1986. Quantitative evaluation shows that EVAL
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art products, boosting the
$\text{R}^2$ from 0.68 to 0.80 while lowering the RMSE from 1.27 to 0.99.
Furthermore, EVAL exhibits excellent temporal consistency and maintains a high
correlation with socioeconomic parameters, confirming its reliability for
long-term analysis. The resulting EVAL dataset provides a valuable new resource
for the research community and is publicly available at
https://doi.org/10.11888/HumanNat.tpdc.302930.

*Jiajun Le,Jiayi Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出GeoMoE框架，通过混合专家模型（MoE）分解运动场，解决复杂场景中运动模式多样性的问题，显著提升两视图几何中的运动场估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂场景中运动场的多样性和异质性导致现有方法难以准确建模，需要针对性策略。

Method: 提出GeoMoE框架，包括概率先验引导分解策略和MoE增强的双路径校正器，分解运动场并针对性建模。

Result: GeoMoE在相对位姿和单应性估计任务中优于现有方法，并表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GeoMoE通过分治策略有效建模异质性运动模式，为两视图几何问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in two-view geometry increasingly emphasizes enforcing
smoothness and global consistency priors when estimating motion fields between
pairs of images. However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by
extreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth
discontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous
motion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and
fail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion
fields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We
observe that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion
sub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion
patterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in
two-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework. Specifically, we first
devise a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition strategy that exploits inlier
probability signals to perform a structure-aware decomposition of the motion
field into heterogeneous sub-fields, sharply curbing outlier-induced bias.
Next, we introduce an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier that enhances each
sub-field along spatial-context and channel-semantic paths and routes it to a
customized expert for targeted modeling, thereby decoupling heterogeneous
motion regimes, suppressing cross-sub-field interference and representational
entanglement, and yielding fine-grained motion-field rectification. With this
minimalist design, GeoMoE outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in
relative pose and homography estimation and shows strong generalization. The
source code and pre-trained models are available at

TL;DR: DPoser-X是一种基于扩散的3D全身人体姿态先验模型，通过变分扩散采样解决姿态任务，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个通用且鲁棒的全身人体姿态先验模型具有挑战性，主要由于人体姿态的复杂性和高质量数据集的稀缺。

Method: 提出扩散模型DPoser-X，结合截断时间步调度和掩码训练机制，统一多种姿态任务为逆问题。

Result: 在身体、手部、面部和全身姿态建模的多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DPoser-X为全身人体姿态先验建模设立了新标准。

Abstract: We present DPoser-X, a diffusion-based prior model for 3D whole-body human
poses. Building a versatile and robust full-body human pose prior remains
challenging due to the inherent complexity of articulated human poses and the
scarcity of high-quality whole-body pose datasets. To address these
limitations, we introduce a Diffusion model as body Pose prior (DPoser) and
extend it to DPoser-X for expressive whole-body human pose modeling. Our
approach unifies various pose-centric tasks as inverse problems, solving them
through variational diffusion sampling. To enhance performance on downstream
applications, we introduce a novel truncated timestep scheduling method
specifically designed for pose data characteristics. We also propose a masked
training mechanism that effectively combines whole-body and part-specific
datasets, enabling our model to capture interdependencies between body parts
while avoiding overfitting to specific actions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DPoser-X's robustness and versatility across multiple benchmarks
for body, hand, face, and full-body pose modeling. Our model consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, establishing a new benchmark for
whole-body human pose prior modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强医学图像诊断中可解释模型的透明性和临床适用性，解决属性标注数据稀缺的挑战。

Method: 使用扩散模型生成属性标注数据，仅需少量真实标注样本（20个肺结节样本），并将其用于训练可解释模型。

Result: 合成数据显著提升了模型性能，属性预测准确率提高13.4%，目标预测准确率提高1.8%。

Conclusion: 合成数据可有效克服数据集限制，推动可解释模型在医学图像分析中的应用。

Abstract: Classification models that provide human-interpretable explanations enhance
clinicians' trust and usability in medical image diagnosis. One research focus
is the integration and prediction of pathology-related visual attributes used
by radiologists alongside the diagnosis, aligning AI decision-making with
clinical reasoning. Radiologists use attributes like shape and texture as
established diagnostic criteria and mirroring these in AI decision-making both
enhances transparency and enables explicit validation of model outputs.
However, the adoption of such models is limited by the scarcity of large-scale
medical image datasets annotated with these attributes. To address this
challenge, we propose synthesizing attribute-annotated data using a generative
model. We enhance the Diffusion Model with attribute conditioning and train it
using only 20 attribute-labeled lung nodule samples from the LIDC-IDRI dataset.
Incorporating its generated images into the training of an explainable model
boosts performance, increasing attribute prediction accuracy by 13.4% and
target prediction accuracy by 1.8% compared to training with only the small
real attribute-annotated dataset. This work highlights the potential of
synthetic data to overcome dataset limitations, enhancing the applicability of
explainable models in medical image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御评估缺乏统一框架，导致评估不一致和不完整，需建立全面基准。

Method: 重新评估11种代表性防御方法，构建大规模对抗补丁数据集（94种补丁和94,000张图像），并设计4种评估指标。

Result: 发现防御性能的关键在于数据分布而非高频特征，新数据集可提升现有防御性能15.09%；自适应攻击能显著绕过现有防御。

Conclusion: 研究为补丁攻击/防御的评估和设计提供了指导，数据集和代码将持续更新。

Abstract: Developing reliable defenses against patch attacks on object detectors has
attracted increasing interest. However, we identify that existing defense
evaluations lack a unified and comprehensive framework, resulting in
inconsistent and incomplete assessments of current methods. To address this
issue, we revisit 11 representative defenses and present the first patch
defense benchmark, involving 2 attack goals, 13 patch attacks, 11 object
detectors, and 4 diverse metrics. This leads to the large-scale adversarial
patch dataset with 94 types of patches and 94,000 images. Our comprehensive
analyses reveal new insights: (1) The difficulty in defending against
naturalistic patches lies in the data distribution, rather than the commonly
believed high frequencies. Our new dataset with diverse patch distributions can
be used to improve existing defenses by 15.09% AP@0.5. (2) The average
precision of the attacked object, rather than the commonly pursued patch
detection accuracy, shows high consistency with defense performance. (3)
Adaptive attacks can substantially bypass existing defenses, and defenses with
complex/stochastic models or universal patch properties are relatively robust.
We hope that our analyses will serve as guidance on properly evaluating patch
attacks/defenses and advancing their design. Code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/Gandolfczjh/APDE, where we will keep integrating new
attacks/defenses.

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了该方法的有效性和广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 预训练深度表示在图像去雾中具有显著潜力，RGB-D融合模块为多样化场景提供了灵活解决方案。

Abstract: Image dehazing remains a challenging problem due to the spatially varying
nature of haze in real-world scenes. While existing methods have demonstrated
the promise of large-scale pretrained models for image dehazing, their
architecture-specific designs hinder adaptability across diverse scenarios with
different accuracy and efficiency requirements. In this work, we systematically
investigate the generalization capability of pretrained depth
representations-learned from millions of diverse images-for image dehazing. Our
empirical analysis reveals that the learned deep depth features maintain
remarkable consistency across varying haze levels. Building on this insight, we
propose a plug-and-play RGB-D fusion module that seamlessly integrates with
diverse dehazing architectures. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks validate both the effectiveness and broad applicability of our
approach.

Abstract: Despite growing interest in hallucination in Multimodal Large Language
Models, existing studies primarily focus on single-image settings, leaving
hallucination in multi-image scenarios largely unexplored. To address this gap,
we conduct the first systematic study of hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs
and propose MIHBench, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating
object-related hallucinations across multiple images. MIHBench comprises three
core tasks: Multi-Image Object Existence Hallucination, Multi-Image Object
Count Hallucination, and Object Identity Consistency Hallucination, targeting
semantic understanding across object existence, quantity reasoning, and
cross-view identity consistency. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key
factors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations,
including: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and
the likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between
single-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image
contexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional
placement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of
object identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we
propose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image
attention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention
proportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that
our method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic
integration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.

Abstract: We propose YOLO-Count, a differentiable open-vocabulary object counting model
that tackles both general counting challenges and enables precise quantity
control for text-to-image (T2I) generation. A core contribution is the
'cardinality' map, a novel regression target that accounts for variations in
object size and spatial distribution. Leveraging representation alignment and a
hybrid strong-weak supervision scheme, YOLO-Count bridges the gap between
open-vocabulary counting and T2I generation control. Its fully differentiable
architecture facilitates gradient-based optimization, enabling accurate object

Motivation: 现有3D目标检测方法多依赖复杂骨干网络，轻量级设计在3D领域研究不足。

Method: 设计Dense Backbone，结合高速处理、轻量结构和鲁棒精度，适配现有检测器如PillarNet。

Result: DensePillarNet在nuScenes测试集上参数减少29%，延迟降低28%，精度仅下降2%。

Conclusion: Dense Backbone为3D点云目标检测提供高效解决方案，易于集成到现有架构。

Abstract: Recent advancements in LiDAR-based 3D object detection have significantly
accelerated progress toward the realization of fully autonomous driving in
real-world environments. Despite achieving high detection performance, most of
the approaches still rely on a VGG-based or ResNet-based backbone for feature
exploration, which increases the model complexity. Lightweight backbone design
is well-explored for 2D object detection, but research on 3D object detection
still remains limited. In this work, we introduce Dense Backbone, a lightweight
backbone that combines the benefits of high processing speed, lightweight
architecture, and robust detection accuracy. We adapt multiple SoTA 3d object
detectors, such as PillarNet, with our backbone and show that with our
backbone, these models retain most of their detection capability at a
significantly reduced computational cost. To our knowledge, this is the first
dense-layer-based backbone tailored specifically for 3D object detection from
point cloud data. DensePillarNet, our adaptation of PillarNet, achieves a 29%
reduction in model parameters and a 28% reduction in latency with just a 2%
drop in detection accuracy on the nuScenes test set. Furthermore, Dense
Backbone's plug-and-play design allows straightforward integration into
existing architectures, requiring no modifications to other network components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督视觉基础模型能捕捉语义对应，但缺乏对3D几何的感知，GECO旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用最优传输的训练框架，生成几何一致的特征，支持遮挡和去遮挡情况下的监督。

Result: GECO在PFPascal、APK和CUB数据集上表现优异，PCK分别提升6.0%、6.2%和4.1%，运行速度达30 fps。

Conclusion: GECO不仅提升了性能，还指出PCK指标的局限性，并提出了新的几何感知特征学习指标。

Abstract: Recent advances in feature learning have shown that self-supervised vision
foundation models can capture semantic correspondences but often lack awareness
of underlying 3D geometry. GECO addresses this gap by producing geometrically
coherent features that semantically distinguish parts based on geometry (e.g.,
left/right eyes, front/back legs). We propose a training framework based on
optimal transport, enabling supervision beyond keypoints, even under occlusions
and disocclusions. With a lightweight architecture, GECO runs at 30 fps, 98.2%
faster than prior methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on
PFPascal, APK, and CUB, improving PCK by 6.0%, 6.2%, and 4.1%, respectively.
Finally, we show that PCK alone is insufficient to capture geometric quality
and introduce new metrics and insights for more geometry-aware feature
learning. Link to project page:

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved realistic
super-resolution (SR) of images however, they lack semantic consistency and
per-pixel confidence, limiting their credibility in critical remote sensing
applications such as disaster response, urban planning and agriculture. This
paper introduces Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN (SU-ESRGAN), the first
SR framework designed for satellite imagery to integrate the ESRGAN,
segmentation loss via DeepLabv3 for class detail preservation and Monte Carlo
dropout to produce pixel-wise uncertainty maps. The SU-ESRGAN produces results
(PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) comparable to the Baseline ESRGAN on aerial imagery. This
novel model is valuable in satellite systems or UAVs that use wide
field-of-view (FoV) cameras, trading off spatial resolution for coverage. The
modular design allows integration in UAV data pipelines for on-board or
post-processing SR to enhance imagery resulting due to motion blur, compression
and sensor limitations. Further, the model is fine-tuned to evaluate its
performance on cross domain applications. The tests are conducted on two drone
based datasets which differ in altitude and imaging perspective. Performance
evaluation of the fine-tuned models show a stronger adaptation to the Aerial
Maritime Drone Dataset, whose imaging characteristics align with the training
data, highlighting the importance of domain-aware training in SR-applications.

Result: 在13个工业和医学基准测试中，PILOT在域偏移下的异常检测和定位性能达到最优。

Conclusion: PILOT通过动态提示学习和测试时适应，显著提升了零样本异常检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) enables identifying and localizing defects
in unseen categories by relying solely on generalizable features rather than
requiring any labeled examples of anomalies. However, existing ZSAD methods,
whether using fixed or learned prompts, struggle under domain shifts because
their training data are derived from limited training domains and fail to
generalize to new distributions. In this paper, we introduce PILOT, a framework
designed to overcome these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a novel
dual-branch prompt learning mechanism that dynamically integrates a pool of
learnable prompts with structured semantic attributes, enabling the model to
adaptively weight the most relevant anomaly cues for each input image; and (2)
a label-free test-time adaptation strategy that updates the learnable prompt
parameters using high-confidence pseudo-labels from unlabeled test data.
Extensive experiments on 13 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that
PILOT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and
localization under domain shift.

Abstract: This study analyzes semantic segmentation performance across heterogeneously

in unifying differently labeled 3D data. Our methodology employs a graded

performance, suggesting potential for navigational context, while smaller
safety-critical features exhibit lower recognition rates. Performance is
impacted by class imbalance and the limited geometric distinction of smaller
objects in typical lidar scans, indicating limitations in detecting certain
safety-relevant features using current point-cloud methods. Key identified
challenges include insufficient labeled data, difficulties in unifying class
labels across datasets, and the need for standardization. Potential directions
include automated labeling and multi-dataset learning strategies. We conclude
that reliable point-cloud semantic segmentation for public safety necessitates
standardized annotation protocols and improved labeling techniques to address
data heterogeneity and the detection of small, safety-critical elements.

Abstract: The discipline of physics stands as a cornerstone of human intellect, driving
the evolution of technology and deepening our understanding of the fundamental
principles of the cosmos. Contemporary literature includes some works centered
on the task of solving physics problems - a crucial domain of natural language
reasoning. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of frontier LLMs in
solving physics problems, both mathematical and descriptive. We also employ a
plethora of inference-time techniques and agentic frameworks to improve the
performance of the models. This includes the verification of proposed solutions
in a cumulative fashion by other, smaller LLM agents, and we perform a
comparative analysis of the performance that the techniques entail. There are
significant improvements when the multi-agent framework is applied to problems
that the models initially perform poorly on. Furthermore, we introduce a new
evaluation benchmark for physics problems, ${\rm P{\small HYSICS}E{\small
VAL}}$, consisting of 19,609 problems sourced from various physics textbooks
and their corresponding correct solutions scraped from physics forums and
educational websites. Our code and data are publicly available at

### [91] [Do LLMs produce texts with "human-like" lexical diversity?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00086)
*Kelly Kendro,Jeffrey Maloney,Scott Jarvis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了四种ChatGPT模型与人类写作的词汇多样性，发现LLM生成的文本在词汇多样性上与人类写作有显著差异，且新模型更不接近人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM生成的文本是否真正接近人类写作，特别是从词汇多样性的角度。

Method: 测量了六种词汇多样性维度，比较了四种ChatGPT模型与240名L1和L2英语参与者的文本。

Result: LLM生成的文本在词汇多样性上与人类写作显著不同，新模型差异更大。

Conclusion: LLM在词汇多样性上未能模拟人类写作，新模型表现更差，对语言教学有启示。

Abstract: The degree to which LLMs produce writing that is truly human-like remains
unclear despite the extensive empirical attention that this question has
received. The present study addresses this question from the perspective of
lexical diversity. Specifically, the study investigates patterns of lexical
diversity in LLM-generated texts from four ChatGPT models (-3.5, -4, -o4 mini,
and -4.5) in comparison with texts written by L1 and L2 English participants (n
= 240) across four education levels. Six dimensions of lexical diversity were
measured in each text: volume, abundance, variety-repetition, evenness,
disparity, and dispersion. Results from one-way MANOVAs, one-way ANOVAS, and
Support Vector Machines revealed that the LLM-generated texts differed
significantly from human-written texts for each variable, with ChatGPT-o4 mini
and -4.5 differing the most. Within these two groups, ChatGPT-4.5 demonstrated
higher levels of lexical diversity despite producing fewer tokens. The human
writers' lexical diversity did not differ across subgroups (i.e., education,
language status). Altogether, the results indicate that LLMs do not produce
human-like texts in relation to lexical diversity, and the newer LLMs produce
less human-like texts than older models. We discuss the implications of these
results for language pedagogy and related applications.

Result: 指出当前建模实践中因忽视符号复杂性而导致的翻译错误，并提出改进建议。

Conclusion: 强调理论化的重要性，并提供具体建议以解决建模中的认识论问题。

Abstract: Greater theorizing of methods in the computational humanities is needed for
epistemological and interpretive clarity, and therefore the maturation of the
field. In this paper, we frame such modeling work as engaging in translation
work from a cultural, linguistic domain into a computational, mathematical
domain, and back again. Translators benefit from articulating the theory of
their translation process, and so do computational humanists in their work --
to ensure internal consistency, avoid subtle yet consequential translation
errors, and facilitate interpretive transparency. Our contribution in this
paper is to lay out a particularly consequential dimension of the lack of
theorizing and the sorts of translation errors that emerge in our modeling
practices as a result. Along these lines we introduce the idea of semiotic
complexity as the degree to which the meaning of some text may vary across
interpretive lenses, and make the case that dominant modeling practices --
especially around evaluation -- commit a translation error by treating
semiotically complex data as semiotically simple when it seems
epistemologically convenient by conferring superficial clarity. We then lay out
several recommendations for researchers to better account for these
epistemological issues in their own work.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准缺乏人工验证，可能导致质量不足，需要更可靠的评估工具。

Method: 采用模型辅助开发并人工优化，构建FACTORY提示集，并对6个SOTA模型进行人工评估。

Result: FACTORY显示40%的SOTA模型回答不准确，远高于其他数据集的10%。

Conclusion: FACTORY是一个可靠且具有挑战性的基准，突显了模型在长尾事实推理上的不足。

Abstract: Long-form factuality evaluation assesses the ability of models to generate
accurate, comprehensive responses to short prompts. Existing benchmarks often
lack human verification, leading to potential quality issues. To address this
limitation, we introduce FACTORY, a large-scale, human-verified prompt set.
Developed using a model-in-the-loop approach and refined by humans, FACTORY
includes challenging prompts that are fact-seeking, answerable, and
unambiguous. We conduct human evaluations on 6 state-of-the-art language models
using FACTORY and existing datasets. Our results show that FACTORY is a
challenging benchmark: approximately 40% of the claims made in the responses of
SOTA models are not factual, compared to only 10% for other datasets. Our
analysis identifies the strengths of FACTORY over prior benchmarks, emphasizing
its reliability and the necessity for models to reason across long-tailed
facts.

Motivation: 研究神经语义解析器是否能处理强上下文敏感现象，尤其是动词短语省略。

Method: 构建包含120个省略案例及其完整语义表示的语料库，用于测试多种神经语义解析器。

Result: 解析器在标准测试集上表现良好，但在省略案例中表现失败。

Conclusion: 数据增强可能有助于改进解析器在省略现象中的表现。

Abstract: Neural semantic parsers have shown good overall performance for a variety of
linguistic phenomena, reaching semantic matching scores of more than 90%. But
how do such parsers perform on strongly context-sensitive phenomena, where
large pieces of semantic information need to be duplicated to form a meaningful
semantic representation? A case in point is English verb phrase ellipsis, a
construct where entire verb phrases can be abbreviated by a single auxiliary
verb. Are the otherwise known as powerful semantic parsers able to deal with
ellipsis or aren't they? We constructed a corpus of 120 cases of ellipsis with
their fully resolved meaning representation and used this as a challenge set
for a large battery of neural semantic parsers. Although these parsers
performed very well on the standard test set, they failed in the instances with
ellipsis. Data augmentation

Result: 提供了一个公开的、持续更新的模型比较列表，发布在GitLab上。

Conclusion: 本文为LLM的选择提供了实用工具，并计划持续更新以适应快速发展的技术环境。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers
(GPTs) are revolutionizing the generation of human-like text, producing
contextually relevant and syntactically correct content. Despite challenges
like biases and hallucinations, these Artificial Intelligence (AI) models excel
in tasks, such as content creation, translation, and code generation.
Fine-tuning and novel architectures, such as Mixture of Experts (MoE), address
these issues. Over the past two years, numerous open-source foundational and
fine-tuned models have been introduced, complicating the selection of the
optimal LLM for researchers and companies regarding licensing and hardware
requirements. To navigate the rapidly evolving LLM landscape and facilitate LLM
selection, we present a comparative list of foundational and domain-specific
models, focusing on features, such as release year, licensing, and hardware
requirements. This list is published on GitLab and will be continuously
updated.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了表格在大型语言模型中的重要性，提出了表格理解的分类和任务，并指出了当前研究的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格因其复杂和灵活的结构在LLMs和MLLMs中备受关注，但缺乏通用方法，导致表格理解任务具有挑战性。

Method: 通过分类表格输入表示和介绍表格理解任务，提出关键概念。

Result: 指出了当前研究的三个主要不足：检索任务主导、处理复杂表格的挑战以及模型泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究以解决表格理解中的关键问题。

Abstract: Tables have gained significant attention in large language models (LLMs) and
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to their complex and flexible
structure. Unlike linear text inputs, tables are two-dimensional, encompassing
formats that range from well-structured database tables to complex,
multi-layered spreadsheets, each with different purposes. This diversity in
format and purpose has led to the development of specialized methods and tasks,
instead of universal approaches, making navigation of table understanding tasks
challenging. To address these challenges, this paper introduces key concepts
through a taxonomy of tabular input representations and an introduction of
table understanding tasks. We highlight several critical gaps in the field that
indicate the need for further research: (1) the predominance of
retrieval-focused tasks that require minimal reasoning beyond mathematical and
logical operations; (2) significant challenges faced by models when processing
complex table structures, large-scale tables, length context, or multi-table
scenarios; and (3) the limited generalization of models across different
tabular representations and formats.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了离散小波变换（DWT）在词和句子嵌入中的应用，展示了其在多分辨率分析和压缩嵌入表示中的能力，同时保持语义质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小波变换在信号和图像处理中已广泛应用，但其在自然语言处理（NLP）中的潜力尚未充分挖掘。本文旨在探索DWT在NLP中的应用，特别是在语义相似性任务中的表现。

Method: 通过将DWT应用于词和句子嵌入，分析不同分辨率下的表示，并评估其在语义相似性任务中的效果。实验使用了多种嵌入模型，包括大型语言模型。

Result: DWT能将嵌入维度降低50-93%，同时几乎不影响语义相似性任务的性能，并在多数下游任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 研究证明了DWT在NLP中的有效性，为提升NLP应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Wavelet transforms, a powerful mathematical tool, have been widely used in
different domains, including Signal and Image processing, to unravel intricate
patterns, enhance data representation, and extract meaningful features from
data. Tangible results from their application suggest that Wavelet transforms
can be applied to NLP capturing a variety of linguistic and semantic
properties. In this paper, we empirically leverage the application of Discrete
Wavelet Transforms (DWT) to word and sentence embeddings. We aim to showcase
the capabilities of DWT in analyzing embedding representations at different
levels of resolution and compressing them while maintaining their overall
quality. We assess the effectiveness of DWT embeddings on semantic similarity
tasks to show how DWT can be used to consolidate important semantic information
in an embedding vector. We show the efficacy of the proposed paradigm using
different embedding models, including large language models, on downstream
tasks. Our results show that DWT can reduce the dimensionality of embeddings by
50-93% with almost no change in performance for semantic similarity tasks,
while achieving superior accuracy in most downstream tasks. Our findings pave
the way for applying DWT to improve NLP applications.

*Bryce Anderson,Riley Galpin,Tom S. Juzek*

TL;DR: 研究发现，2022年后人类语言中与大型语言模型（LLM）相关的词汇使用显著增加，表明人类语言选择与LLM模式趋同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLM）是否对人类语言系统本身产生广泛影响。

Method: 构建2200万单词的非脚本口语数据集，分析ChatGPT发布前后的词汇趋势。

Result: 2022年后与LLM相关的词汇使用显著增加，而基线同义词无明显变化。

Conclusion: 这可能标志着语言使用的显著变化，但变化是自然语言演变还是AI驱动的尚不明确。

Abstract: In recent years, written language, particularly in science and education, has
undergone remarkable shifts in word usage. These changes are widely attributed
to the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely
on a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target
audience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are
often linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to
generate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes
in the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a
dataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from
conversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends
before and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated
words. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of
these words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and
LLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no
significant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of
words affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language
use. Whether this represents natural language change or a novel shift driven by
AI exposure remains an open question. Similarly, although the shifts may stem
from broader adoption patterns, it may also be that upstream training
misalignments ultimately contribute to changes in human language use. These
findings parallel ethical concerns that misaligned models may shape social and
moral beliefs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在医学文本理解和生成方面表现出色，但其在复杂临床诊断中的可靠性有限，因此需要提升其诊断准确性和临床推理能力。

Method: 研究构建了基于权威指南的临床推理支架（CRS），开发了病因感知头识别算法，并引入推理引导的参数高效微调方法，通过推理引导损失函数优化模型。

Result: 在一致性诊断队列中，框架将平均诊断准确率提高了15.65%，推理聚焦分数提升了31.6%，外部验证也证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将模型注意力与结构化CRS对齐，为构建更可解释和可靠的AI诊断系统提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Objective: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant capabilities
in medical text understanding and generation. However, their diagnostic
reliability in complex clinical scenarios remains limited. This study aims to
enhance LLMs' diagnostic accuracy and clinical reasoning ability. Method: We
propose an Etiology-Aware Attention Steering Framework to integrate structured
clinical reasoning into LLM-based diagnosis. Specifically, we first construct
Clinical Reasoning Scaffolding (CRS) based on authoritative clinical guidelines
for three representative acute abdominal emergencies: acute appendicitis, acute
pancreatitis, and acute cholecystitis. Next, we develop the Etiology-Aware Head
Identification algorithm to pinpoint attention heads crucial for the model's
etiology reasoning. To ensure reliable clinical reasoning alignment, we
introduce the Reasoning-Guided Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning that embeds
etiological reasoning cues into input representations and steers the selected
Etiology-Aware Heads toward critical information through a Reasoning-Guided
Loss function. Result: On the Consistent Diagnosis Cohort, our framework
improves average diagnostic accuracy by 15.65% and boosts the average Reasoning
Focus Score by 31.6% over baselines. External validation on the Discrepant
Diagnosis Cohort further confirms its effectiveness in enhancing diagnostic
accuracy. Further assessments via Reasoning Attention Frequency indicate that
our models exhibit enhanced reliability when faced with real-world complex
scenarios. Conclusion: This study presents a practical and effective approach
to enhance clinical reasoning in LLM-based diagnosis. By aligning model
attention with structured CRS, the proposed framework offers a promising
paradigm for building more interpretable and reliable AI diagnostic systems in
complex clinical settings.

Result: 实验发现，组合优化算法可能因累积近似误差对大型模型产生负面影响，且仅依赖F1分数会掩盖问答任务中的精度-召回权衡。

Conclusion: 通过结合系统级分析和任务特定见解，本研究为LLM实践者和研究者提供了平衡效率、准确性和扩展性的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse natural language processing
tasks but face resource demands and limited context windows. Although
techniques like pruning, quantization, and token dropping can mitigate these
issues, their efficacy in long-context scenarios and system evaluation remains
underexplored. This paper systematically benchmarks these optimizations,
characterizing memory usage, latency, and throughput, and studies how these
methods impact the quality of text generation. We first analyze individual
optimization methods for two LLM architectures supporting long context and then
systematically evaluate combinations of these techniques to assess how this
deeper analysis impacts performance metrics. We subsequently study the
scalability of individual optimization methods on a larger variant with 70
billion-parameter model. Our novel insights reveal that naive combination
inference optimization algorithms can adversely affect larger models due to
compounded approximation errors, as compared to their smaller counterparts.
Experiments show that relying solely on F1 obscures these effects by hiding
precision-recall trade-offs in question answering tasks. By integrating
system-level profiling with task-specific insights, this study helps LLM
practitioners and researchers explore and balance efficiency, accuracy, and
scalability across tasks and hardware configurations.

TL;DR: MCSEO提出了一种通过细粒度对象-短语对齐增强多模态句子嵌入的方法，利用分割和对象检测模型提取对象-短语对，优化对比学习目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态句子嵌入模型训练中，图像-标题对常包含冗余或无关信息，影响模型性能。

Method: MCSEO利用分割和对象检测模型提取对象-短语对，优化对比学习目标。

Result: 在语义文本相似性任务中，MCSEO优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 细粒度对象-短语对齐对多模态表示学习具有重要意义。

Abstract: Multimodal sentence embedding models typically leverage image-caption pairs
in addition to textual data during training. However, such pairs often contain
noise, including redundant or irrelevant information on either the image or
caption side. To mitigate this issue, we propose MCSEO, a method that enhances
multimodal sentence embeddings by incorporating fine-grained object-phrase
alignment alongside traditional image-caption alignment. Specifically, MCSEO
utilizes existing segmentation and object detection models to extract accurate
object-phrase pairs, which are then used to optimize a contrastive learning
objective tailored to object-phrase correspondence. Experimental results on
semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks across different backbone models
demonstrate that MCSEO consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting
the significance of precise object-phrase alignment in multimodal
representation learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AdaPlan的自适应全局规划代理范式，结合了PilotRL训练框架，以提升LLM在复杂任务中的长期决策能力。实验显示其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在复杂任务中表现受限，主要因单步推理与执行模式（如ReAct）无法支持长期规划，且监督微调导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出AdaPlan范式，结合全局规划与执行；设计PilotRL框架，通过渐进式强化学习优化规划和执行协调。

Result: LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + PilotRL性能超越GPT-4o 3.60%，对比GPT-4o-mini提升55.78%。

Conclusion: AdaPlan和PilotRL显著提升了LLM代理在复杂任务中的表现，验证了全局规划与执行协同优化的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in tackling
agent-oriented tasks. Despite their potential, existing work faces challenges
when deploying LLMs in agent-based environments. The widely adopted agent
paradigm ReAct centers on integrating single-step reasoning with immediate
action execution, which limits its effectiveness in complex tasks requiring
long-term strategic planning. Furthermore, the coordination between the planner
and executor during problem-solving is also a critical factor to consider in
agent design. Additionally, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised
fine-tuning, which often leads models to memorize established task completion
trajectories, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted
with novel problem contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce an
adaptive global plan-based agent paradigm AdaPlan, aiming to synergize
high-level explicit guidance with execution to support effective long-horizon
decision-making. Based on the proposed paradigm, we further put forward
PilotRL, a global planning-guided training framework for LLM agents driven by
progressive reinforcement learning. We first develop the model's ability to
follow explicit guidance from global plans when addressing agent tasks.
Subsequently, based on this foundation, we focus on optimizing the quality of
generated plans. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's planning
and execution coordination. Experiments indicate that PilotRL could achieve
state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + PilotRL surpassing
closed-sourced GPT-4o by 3.60%, while showing a more substantial gain of 55.78%
comparing to GPT-4o-mini at a comparable parameter scale.

Motivation: 解决小语言模型在知识密集型任务中的性能限制，探索动态推理机制以提升表现。

Method: 提出动态任务向量机器范式，利用<think>和</think>标签标记内部推理，并通过RLVR优化。

Result: Lucy（1.7B参数）在SimpleQA基准测试中达到78.3%准确率，与更大模型性能相当。

Conclusion: 小模型通过结构化、自构建的任务推理机制，可以媲美大模型性能。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are inherently limited in knowledge-intensive
tasks due to their constrained capacity. While test-time computation offers a
path to enhanced performance, most approaches treat reasoning as a fixed or
heuristic process. In this work, we propose a new paradigm: viewing the model's
internal reasoning, delimited by <think> and </think> tags, as a dynamic task
vector machine. Rather than treating the content inside these tags as a mere
trace of thought, we interpret the generation process itself as a mechanism
through which the model \textbf{constructs and refines its own task vectors} on
the fly. We developed a method to optimize this dynamic task vector machine
through RLVR and successfully trained an agentic web-search model. We present
Lucy, a 1.7B-parameter SLM that leverages this dynamic reasoning mechanism with
MCP integration to achieve 78.3% accuracy on the SimpleQA benchmark, performing
on par with much larger models such as DeepSeek-V3. This demonstrates that
small models can rival large ones when equipped with structured,
self-constructed task reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的边缘设备上部署基于Transformer的大语言模型（LLM）面临计算和内存效率的挑战，现有方法难以兼顾时间效率和性能。

Method: 提出EdgeInfinite-Instruct，采用S-SFT策略和PTQ优化，结合固定形状计算图，定制输入令牌和缓存大小。

Result: 在长上下文基准测试和实际移动任务中，该方法提升了领域性能并保持了边缘设备的效率。

Conclusion: EdgeInfinite-Instruct为长序列任务在边缘设备上的高效部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained edge devices for long-sequence tasks remains challenging
due to the quadratic time complexity of self-attention and growing Key-Value
(KV) cache demands. While existing KV cache optimizations improve memory
efficiency, they often fail to reduce time to first token (TTFT) and may
degrade performance through token pruning. Alternative sequence modeling
architectures address some of these limitations, but typically require full
retraining and lack infrastructure support. EdgeInfinite offers an efficient
solution by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, maintaining quality
while reducing both computational and memory costs, including improved TTFT.
However, its instruction-following ability is limited, and it lacks
mobile-specific optimizations. To address these issues, we propose
EdgeInfinite-Instruct, which introduces a Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning
(S-SFT) strategy tailored to long-sequence tasks such as summarization and
question answering. We further optimized EdgeInfinite-Instruct for efficient
deployment on edge NPUs by employing fine-grained post-training quantization
(PTQ) to reduce computational demands while maintaining accuracy, and by
implementing a fixed-shape computation graph that balances memory usage and
on-device efficiency through scenario-specific customization of input token and
cache sizes. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and real-world mobile tasks
show that our approach improves domain-specific performance while maintaining

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了演示在上下文学习（ICL）中无效的原因，提出了一种基于梯度流的演示选择方法GradS，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多假设ICL中的演示有效，但实际并非所有演示都能提升性能，因此探究无效原因并提出改进方法。

Method: 通过梯度流和线性自注意力模型分析，提出GradS方法，利用梯度流幅度选择有效演示。

Result: 实验验证了演示有效性随模型层数增加而分化的现象，GradS在多个数据集上平均提升6.8%。

Conclusion: GradS通过梯度流选择演示，显著提升ICL性能，为演示选择提供了新思路。

Abstract: Numerous studies have investigated the underlying mechanisms of in-context
learning (ICL) effectiveness to inspire the design of related methods. However,
existing work predominantly assumes the effectiveness of the demonstrations
provided within ICL, while many research indicates that not all demonstrations
are effective, failing to yielding any performance improvement during ICL.
Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the reasons behind demonstration
ineffectiveness. Our analysis is based on gradient flow and linear
self-attention models. By setting the gradient flow to zero, we deduce that a
demonstration becomes ineffective if its information has either been learned by
the model or is irrelevant to the user query. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
in multi-layer models, the disparity in effectiveness among demonstrations is
amplified with layer increasing, causing the model to focus more on effective
ones. Considering that current demonstration selection methods primarily focus
on the relevance to the user query while overlooking the information that the
model has already assimilated, we propose a novel method called GradS, which
leverages gradient flow for demonstration selection. We use the magnitude of
the gradient flow of the demonstration with respect to a given user query as
the criterion, thereby ensuring the effectiveness of the chosen ones. We
validate our derivation and GradS on four prominent LLMs across five mainstream
datasets. The experimental results confirm that the disparity in effectiveness
among demonstrations is magnified as the model layer increases, substantiating
our derivations. Moreover, GradS achieves a relative improvement of $6.8\%$ on
average over the strongest baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SA-GCS的训练框架，通过结合课程学习与强化学习，优化无人机视觉语言导航任务的训练效率与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在无人机视觉语言导航任务中存在训练数据利用效率低、收敛慢及未充分考虑样本难度差异的问题。

Method: 提出SA-GCS框架，包括语义感知难度估计器（SA-DE）和高斯课程调度器（GCS），动态调整训练样本分布。

Result: 在CityNav基准测试中，SA-GCS在所有指标上均优于基线方法，收敛更快且更稳定。

Conclusion: SA-GCS框架显著提升了训练效率和模型性能，具有鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to enable
agents to accurately localize targets and plan flight paths in complex
environments based on natural language instructions, with broad applications in
intelligent inspection, disaster rescue, and urban monitoring. Recent progress
in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has provided strong semantic understanding for
this task, while reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising
post-training strategy to further improve generalization. However, existing RL
methods often suffer from inefficient use of training data, slow convergence,
and insufficient consideration of the difficulty variation among training
samples, which limits further performance improvement. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{Semantic-Aware Gaussian Curriculum Scheduling
(SA-GCS)}, a novel training framework that systematically integrates Curriculum
Learning (CL) into RL. SA-GCS employs a Semantic-Aware Difficulty Estimator
(SA-DE) to quantify the complexity of training samples and a Gaussian
Curriculum Scheduler (GCS) to dynamically adjust the sampling distribution,
enabling a smooth progression from easy to challenging tasks. This design
significantly improves training efficiency, accelerates convergence, and
enhances overall model performance. Extensive experiments on the CityNav
benchmark demonstrate that SA-GCS consistently outperforms strong baselines
across all metrics, achieves faster and more stable convergence, and
generalizes well across models of different scales, highlighting its robustness
and scalability. The implementation of our approach is publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了将离散小波变换（DWT）应用于词和句子嵌入的方法，结合离散余弦变换（DCT）提出了一种非参数化模型，用于压缩句子信息，并在下游任务中表现出色。


<details>

Motivation: 小波技术在图像和信号处理中表现优异，作者希望将其扩展到自然语言处理（NLP）任务中，以捕捉多种语言特性。

Method: 使用DWT对词向量进行降维和信息整合，并结合DCT提出非参数化模型，压缩句子信息为固定大小的向量。

Result: 提出的方法在下游任务中表现优异，部分任务甚至优于原始嵌入。

Conclusion: 小波变换在NLP中具有潜力，能够有效压缩信息并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Wavelets have emerged as a cutting edge technology in a number of fields.
Concrete results of their application in Image and Signal processing suggest
that wavelets can be effectively applied to Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tasks that capture a variety of linguistic properties. In this paper, we
leverage the power of applying Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) to word and
sentence embeddings. We first evaluate, intrinsically and extrinsically, how
wavelets can effectively be used to consolidate important information in a word
vector while reducing its dimensionality. We further combine DWT with Discrete
Cosine Transform (DCT) to propose a non-parameterized model that compresses a
sentence with a dense amount of information in a fixed size vector based on
locally varying word features. We show the efficacy of the proposed paradigm on
downstream applications models yielding comparable and even superior (in some
tasks) results to original embeddings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReaGAN提出了一种基于代理的图神经网络框架，通过节点级自主决策和检索增强生成，解决了传统GNN在节点信息不平衡和全局语义关系捕获上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN的固定聚合机制无法处理节点信息不平衡和全局语义关系，限制了模型的性能。

Method: ReaGAN为每个节点赋予代理能力，使其能独立决策和自适应传播信息，并结合检索增强生成技术捕获全局语义关系。

Result: ReaGAN在少样本情境下表现优异，无需微调即可利用冻结的LLM骨干网络实现竞争性性能。

Conclusion: ReaGAN展示了代理规划和局部-全局检索在图学习中的潜力，为GNN提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in graph-based
learning by propagating information among neighbor nodes via predefined
aggregation mechanisms. However, such fixed schemes often suffer from two key
limitations. First, they cannot handle the imbalance in node informativeness --
some nodes are rich in information, while others remain sparse. Second,
predefined message passing primarily leverages local structural similarity
while ignoring global semantic relationships across the graph, limiting the
model's ability to capture distant but relevant information. We propose
Retrieval-augmented Graph Agentic Network (ReaGAN), an agent-based framework
that empowers each node with autonomous, node-level decision-making. Each node
acts as an agent that independently plans its next action based on its internal
memory, enabling node-level planning and adaptive message propagation.
Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows nodes to access
semantically relevant content and build global relationships in the graph.
ReaGAN achieves competitive performance under few-shot in-context settings
using a frozen LLM backbone without fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of
agentic planning and local-global retrieval in graph learning.

Motivation: 当前基于LLM的对话评估方法存在偏见和计算成本高的问题，需要一种更高效且可靠的解决方案。

Method: 通过聚合多个LLM评委的偏好知识到单一模型中，实现高效的多轮对话评估。

Result: 在七个对话评估基准测试中表现优于现有基线，证明了方法的效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了评估成本，同时保持了多评委反馈的优势，适用于快速灵活的对话质量评估。

Abstract: Evaluating the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs)
remains a challenging task. Current mainstream approaches primarily rely on the
``LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where an LLM is prompted to serve as an evaluator
to assess dialogue quality. However, such methods often suffer from various
biases, which undermine the reliability and consistency of the evaluation
results. To mitigate these biases, recent methods employ multiple LLMs as
judges and aggregate their judgments to select the optimal assessment. Although
effective, this multi-judge approach incurs significant computational overhead
during inference. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-turn dialogue
evaluator that captures the collective wisdom of multiple LLM judges by
aggregating their preference knowledge into a single model. Our approach
preserves the advantages of diverse multi-judge feedback while drastically
reducing the evaluation cost, enabling fast and flexible dialogue quality
assessment. Extensive experiments on seven single rating and pairwise
comparison dialogue evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing baselines across diverse scenarios, showcasing its
efficiency and robustness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了半真检测任务和PolitiFact-Hidden基准数据集，并开发了TRACER框架，用于识别基于遗漏的虚假信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查系统无法处理因遗漏关键上下文而导致的半真问题。

Method: 提出TRACER框架，通过证据对齐、意图推断和隐藏内容因果影响估计来检测遗漏型虚假信息。

Result: TRACER显著提升了半真分类性能（F1分数提高16分），并可与现有事实核查系统集成。

Conclusion: 建模遗漏信息对可信事实核查至关重要，TRACER为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fact verification systems typically assess whether a claim is supported by
retrieved evidence, assuming that truthfulness depends solely on what is
stated. However, many real-world claims are half-truths, factually correct yet
misleading due to the omission of critical context. Existing models struggle
with such cases, as they are not designed to reason about what is left unsaid.
We introduce the task of half-truth detection, and propose PolitiFact-Hidden, a
new benchmark with 15k political claims annotated with sentence-level evidence
alignment and inferred claim intent. To address this challenge, we present
TRACER, a modular re-assessment framework that identifies omission-based
misinformation by aligning evidence, inferring implied intent, and estimating
the causal impact of hidden content. TRACER can be integrated into existing
fact-checking pipelines and consistently improves performance across multiple
strong baselines. Notably, it boosts Half-True classification F1 by up to 16
points, highlighting the importance of modeling omissions for trustworthy fact
verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LoRA的表达能力与泛化能力之间的关联，并填补现有方法在平坦最小值与泛化关系研究上的空白。

Method: 提出Flat-LoRA和EFlat-LoRA，理论证明全参数空间的扰动可转移到低秩子空间，避免多矩阵干扰。

Result: 在GLUE和视觉语言模型上，EFlat-LoRA表现优于LoRA和全微调，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: EFlat-LoRA在保持高效的同时提升性能，验证了LoRA泛化与平坦性的紧密关联。

Abstract: Little research explores the correlation between the expressive ability and
generalization ability of the low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Sharpness-Aware
Minimization (SAM) improves model generalization for both Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers by encouraging convergence to locally flat
minima. However, the connection between sharpness and generalization has not
been fully explored for LoRA due to the lack of tools to either empirically
seek flat minima or develop theoretical methods. In this work, we propose
Flat-LoRA and its efficient version i.e., EFlat-LoRA, to seek flat minima for
LoRA. Concretely, we theoretically demonstrate that perturbations in the full
parameter space can be transferred to the low-rank subspace. This approach
eliminates the potential interference introduced by perturbations across
multiple matrices in the low-rank subspace. Our extensive experiments on large
language models and vision-language models demonstrate that EFlat-LoRA achieves
optimize efficiency comparable to that of LoRA while simultaneously attaining
comparable or even better performance. For example, on the GLUE dataset with
RoBERTa-large, EFlat-LoRA outperforms LoRA and full fine-tuning by 1.0% and
0.5% on average, respectively. On vision-language models e.g., Qwen-VL-Chat
shows performance improvements of 1.5% and 1.0% on SQA and VizWiz datasets,
respectively. These empirical results also verify that the generalization of
LoRA is closely related to sharpness, which is omitted by previous methods.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了表情符号如何影响语音中的韵律实现以及听者如何通过韵律线索理解表情符号的含义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在文本交流中，韵律特征（如音高、节奏和语调）缺失，表情符号作为视觉替代品传递情感和语用信息。研究旨在直接关联韵律和表情符号，填补此前研究的空白。

Method: 通过结构化的开放式生产和感知任务收集真实人类语音数据，分析表情符号如何塑造语音表达和感知。

Result: 说话者会根据表情符号调整韵律，听者能通过韵律变化识别表情符号，且表情符号语义差异越大，韵律差异越明显。

Conclusion: 表情符号能有效传递韵律意图，揭示了其在数字媒介中的交际作用。

Abstract: Prosodic features such as pitch, timing, and intonation are central to spoken
communication, conveying emotion, intent, and discourse structure. In
text-based settings, where these cues are absent, emojis act as visual
surrogates that add affective and pragmatic nuance. This study examines how
emojis influence prosodic realisation in speech and how listeners interpret
prosodic cues to recover emoji meanings. Unlike previous work, we directly link
prosody and emoji by analysing actual human speech data, collected through
structured but open-ended production and perception tasks. This provides
empirical evidence of how emoji semantics shape spoken delivery and perception.
Results show that speakers adapt their prosody based on emoji cues, listeners
can often identify the intended emoji from prosodic variation alone, and
greater semantic differences between emojis correspond to increased prosodic
divergence. These findings suggest that emojis can act as meaningful carriers
of prosodic intent, offering insight into their communicative role in digitally
mediated contexts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PaPaformer的并行路径解码器变压器架构，通过单独训练低维路径并合并为更大模型，显著减少训练时间和参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型语言模型训练耗时且计算资源密集，即使是小型模型也需要多GPU和数天时间。本文旨在缩短训练时间至小时级别。

Method: 采用并行路径结构的PaPaformer，低维路径可单独训练并合并为更大模型，支持不同训练数据和任务定制。

Result: 减少了总参数数量和训练时间，同时性能提升，并行结构还支持任务定制化。

Conclusion: PaPaformer为高效训练语言模型提供了新思路，兼具性能和时间优势。

Abstract: The training of modern large-language models requires an increasingly amount
of computation power and time. Even smaller variants, such as small-language
models (SLMs), take several days to train in the best-case scenarios, often
requiring multiple GPUs. This paper explores methods to train and evaluate
decoder-only transformer-based language models in hours instead of days/weeks.
We introduces \textit{PaPaformer}, a decoder-only transformer architecture
variant, whose lower-dimensional parallel paths are combined into larger model.
The paper shows that these lower-dimensional paths can be trained individually
with different types of training data and then combined into one larger model.
This method gives the option to reduce the total number of model parameters and
the training time with increasing performance. Moreover, the use of parallel
path structure opens interesting possibilities to customize paths to
accommodate specific task requirements.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SynAdapt的高效推理框架，通过生成合成连续思维链（CCoT）作为对齐目标，并结合难度分类器提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续思维链（CCoT）方法存在间接微调、对齐不足或目标不一致的问题，限制了推理效率。

Method: SynAdapt生成合成CCoT作为对齐目标，并引入难度分类器识别难题，自适应地提示模型重新思考。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个基准测试中实现了最佳的准确性与效率平衡。

Conclusion: SynAdapt通过合成CCoT和难度分类器，显著提升了推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves model performance, it incurs
significant time costs due to the generation of discrete CoT tokens (DCoT).
Continuous CoT (CCoT) offers a more efficient alternative, but existing CCoT
methods are hampered by indirect fine-tuning, limited alignment, or
inconsistent targets. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textit{SynAdapt}, an innovative efficient reasoning framework. Specifically,
\textit{SynAdapt} generates the synthetic CCoT to serve as a precise and
effective alignment target for LLMs. This synthetic CCoT explicitly guides the
LLM to learn CCoT and derive accurate answers directly. Furthermore, relying
solely on CCoT is insufficient for solving hard questions. To address this,
\textit{SynAdapt} integrates a difficulty classifier that leverages both
question context and CCoT to identify hard questions. CCoT can effectively help
identify hard questions after some brief reasoning. We then adaptively prompt
the LLM to re-think these hard questions for improved performance. Extensive
experimental results across various benchmarks from different difficulty levels
strongly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving the best
accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM置信度估计方法忽略了响应与上下文信息的相关性，这在输出质量评估中至关重要，尤其是在提供背景知识的场景中。

Method: 提出CRUX框架，通过上下文熵减少（衡量数据不确定性）和统一一致性检查（捕捉模型不确定性）来估计置信度。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（CoQA、SQuAD、QuAC）和领域数据集（BioASQ、EduQG）上，CRUX的AUROC表现最优。

Conclusion: CRUX通过整合上下文信息，显著提升了LLM置信度估计的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate confidence estimation is essential for trustworthy large language
models (LLMs) systems, as it empowers the user to determine when to trust
outputs and enables reliable deployment in safety-critical applications.
Current confidence estimation methods for LLMs neglect the relevance between
responses and contextual information, a crucial factor in output quality
evaluation, particularly in scenarios where background knowledge is provided.
To bridge this gap, we propose CRUX (Context-aware entropy Reduction and
Unified consistency eXamination), the first framework that integrates context
faithfulness and consistency for confidence estimation via two novel metrics.
First, contextual entropy reduction represents data uncertainty with the
information gain through contrastive sampling with and without context. Second,
unified consistency examination captures potential model uncertainty through
the global consistency of the generated answers with and without context.
Experiments across three benchmark datasets (CoQA, SQuAD, QuAC) and two
domain-specific datasets (BioASQ, EduQG) demonstrate CRUX's effectiveness,
achieving the highest AUROC than existing baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图卷积网络（GCN）的混合主题模型GHTM，用于解决孟加拉语主题建模的挑战，并在实验中优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语因其形态复杂性和资源匮乏，主题建模研究较少，需要更有效的模型。

Method: 使用GCN生成语义丰富的文档嵌入，再通过非负矩阵分解（NMF）提取主题。

Result: GHTM在主题一致性和多样性上优于传统和现代方法，并引入新的孟加拉语数据集NCTBText。

Conclusion: GHTM为孟加拉语主题建模提供了有效解决方案，并丰富了数据集资源。

Abstract: Topic modeling is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that is used
to identify latent themes and extract topics from text corpora by grouping
similar documents based on their most significant keywords. Although widely
researched in English, topic modeling remains understudied in Bengali due to
its morphological complexity, lack of adequate resources and initiatives. In
this contribution, a novel Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based model called
GHTM (Graph-Based Hybrid Topic Model) is proposed. This model represents input
vectors of documents as nodes in the graph, which GCN uses to produce
semantically rich embeddings. The embeddings are then decomposed using
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to get the topical representations of
the underlying themes of the text corpus. This study compares the proposed
model against a wide range of Bengali topic modeling techniques, from
traditional methods such as LDA, LSA, and NMF to contemporary frameworks such
as BERTopic and Top2Vec on three Bengali datasets. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model by outperforming other
models in topic coherence and diversity. In addition, we introduce a novel
Bengali dataset called "NCTBText" sourced from Bengali textbook materials to
enrich and diversify the predominantly newspaper-centric Bengali corpora.

Conclusion: 简单的提示变化可能不如预期有效，尤其是在解决难题时。

Abstract: This is the third in a series of short reports that seek to help business,
education, and policy leaders understand the technical details of working with
AI through rigorous testing. In this report, we investigate two commonly held
prompting beliefs: a) offering to tip the AI model and b) threatening the AI
model. Tipping was a commonly shared tactic for improving AI performance and
threats have been endorsed by Google Founder Sergey Brin (All-In, May 2025,
8:20) who observed that 'models tend to do better if you threaten them,' a
claim we subject to empirical testing here. We evaluate model performance on
GPQA (Rein et al. 2024) and MMLU-Pro (Wang et al. 2024).
  We demonstrate two things:
  - Threatening or tipping a model generally has no significant effect on
benchmark performance.
  - Prompt variations can significantly affect performance on a per-question
level. However, it is hard to know in advance whether a particular prompting
approach will help or harm the LLM's ability to answer any particular question.
  Taken together, this suggests that simple prompting variations might not be
as effective as previously assumed, especially for difficult problems. However,
as reported previously (Meincke et al. 2025a), prompting approaches can yield
significantly different results for individual questions.

Conclusion: NusaAksara填补了印尼语言脚本NLP研究的空白，突显了现有技术的不足。

Abstract: Indonesia is rich in languages and scripts. However, most NLP progress has
been made using romanized text. In this paper, we present NusaAksara, a novel
public benchmark for Indonesian languages that includes their original scripts.
Our benchmark covers both text and image modalities and encompasses diverse

language identification. Our data is constructed by human experts through
rigorous steps. NusaAksara covers 8 scripts across 7 languages, including
low-resource languages not commonly seen in NLP benchmarks. Although
unsupported by Unicode, the Lampung script is included in this dataset. We
benchmark our data across several models, from LLMs and VLMs such as GPT-4o,
Llama 3.2, and Aya 23 to task-specific systems such as PP-OCR and LangID, and
show that most NLP technologies cannot handle Indonesia's local scripts, with
many achieving near-zero performance.

Abstract: Existing AIG (AI-generated) text detectors struggle in real-world settings
despite succeeding in internal testing, suggesting that they may not be robust
enough. We rigorously examine the machine-learning procedure to build these
detectors to address this. Most current AIG text detection datasets focus on
zero-shot generations, but little work has been done on few-shot or one-shot
generations, where LLMs are given human texts as an example. In response, we
introduce the Diverse Adversarial Corpus of Texts Yielded from Language models
(DACTYL), a challenging AIG text detection dataset focusing on
one-shot/few-shot generations. We also include texts from domain-specific
continued-pre-trained (CPT) language models, where we fully train all
parameters using a memory-efficient optimization approach. Many existing AIG
text detectors struggle significantly on our dataset, indicating a potential
vulnerability to one-shot/few-shot and CPT-generated texts. We also train our
own classifiers using two approaches: standard binary cross-entropy (BCE)
optimization and a more recent approach, deep X-risk optimization (DXO). While
BCE-trained classifiers marginally outperform DXO classifiers on the DACTYL
test set, the latter excels on out-of-distribution (OOD) texts. In our mock
deployment scenario in student essay detection with an OOD student essay
dataset, the best DXO classifier outscored the best BCE-trained classifier by
50.56 macro-F1 score points at the lowest false positive rates for both. Our
results indicate that DXO classifiers generalize better without overfitting to
the test set. Our experiments highlight several areas of improvement for AIG
text detectors.

Motivation: 医学实践中需要系统、透明和可验证的推理能力，而现有LLMs在此方面存在不足，因此需要专门设计用于医学推理的模型。

Method: 提出了一种分类法，包括训练时策略（如监督微调、强化学习）和测试时机制（如提示工程、多智能体系统），并分析了这些技术在多种数据模态和临床应用中的应用。

Result: 通过分析60项研究，总结了医学推理LLMs的发展趋势，并识别了关键挑战，如忠实性与合理性之间的差距和多模态推理的需求。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in medicine has enabled
impressive capabilities, yet a critical gap remains in their ability to perform
systematic, transparent, and verifiable reasoning, a cornerstone of clinical
practice. This has catalyzed a shift from single-step answer generation to the
development of LLMs explicitly designed for medical reasoning. This paper
provides the first systematic review of this emerging field. We propose a
taxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, categorized into training-time
strategies (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time
mechanisms (e.g., prompt engineering, multi-agent systems). We analyze how
these techniques are applied across different data modalities (text, image,
code) and in key clinical applications such as diagnosis, education, and
treatment planning. Furthermore, we survey the evolution of evaluation
benchmarks from simple accuracy metrics to sophisticated assessments of
reasoning quality and visual interpretability. Based on an analysis of 60
seminal studies from 2022-2025, we conclude by identifying critical challenges,
including the faithfulness-plausibility gap and the need for native multimodal
reasoning, and outlining future directions toward building efficient, robust,
and sociotechnically responsible medical AI.

Motivation: 现有LLM评估资源主要针对英语和西方文化，缺乏对其他语言和文化背景的覆盖，尤其是波斯语和伊朗文化。

Method: 研究设计了19个评估数据集，涵盖伊朗法律、波斯语法、波斯习语和大学入学考试等内容，并用于测试41个LLMs。

Result: 通过新数据集对LLMs进行了基准测试，填补了文化和语言评估的空白。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLMs在非西方语言和文化背景下的评估提供了重要资源，有助于提升模型的多样性和可靠性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in our daily
lives, evaluating their quality and reliability across diverse contexts has
become essential. While comprehensive benchmarks exist for assessing LLM
performance in English, there remains a significant gap in evaluation resources
for other languages. Moreover, because most LLMs are trained primarily on data
rooted in European and American cultures, they often lack familiarity with
non-Western cultural contexts. To address this limitation, our study focuses on
the Persian language and Iranian culture. We introduce 19 new evaluation
datasets specifically designed to assess LLMs on topics such as Iranian law,
Persian grammar, Persian idioms, and university entrance exams. Using these
datasets, we benchmarked 41 prominent LLMs, aiming to bridge the existing
cultural and linguistic evaluation gap in the field.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于预训练语言模型和双向LSTM的序列句子对分类器（SSPC），用于检测文档中的风格变化，并在PAN 2025任务中取得了优于基线的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风格变化检测是计算作者分析中的重要且具有挑战性的问题，尤其是在句子级别检测风格切换。

Method: 使用预训练语言模型（PLM）获取句子表示，通过双向LSTM（BiLSTM）上下文化句子，并将相邻句子的向量拼接后输入多层感知机进行预测。

Result: 在PAN-2025测试数据集上，模型在EASY、MEDIUM和HARD数据上的宏F1分数分别为0.923、0.828和0.724，优于随机基线和Claude-3.7-sonnet的零样本性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过上下文信息有效解决了短句子风格变化检测的挑战，表现优于基线模型。

Abstract: Style change detection - identifying the points in a document where writing
style shifts - remains one of the most important and challenging problems in
computational authorship analysis. At PAN 2025, the shared task challenges
participants to detect style switches at the most fine-grained level:
individual sentences. The task spans three datasets, each designed with
controlled and increasing thematic variety within documents. We propose to
address this problem by modeling the content of each problem instance - that
is, a series of sentences - as a whole, using a Sequential Sentence Pair
Classifier (SSPC). The architecture leverages a pre-trained language model
(PLM) to obtain representations of individual sentences, which are then fed
into a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) to contextualize them within the document.
The BiLSTM-produced vectors of adjacent sentences are concatenated and passed
to a multi-layer perceptron for prediction per adjacency. Building on the work
of previous PAN participants classical text segmentation, the approach is
relatively conservative and lightweight. Nevertheless, it proves effective in
leveraging contextual information and addressing what is arguably the most
challenging aspect of this year's shared task: the notorious problem of
"stylistically shallow", short sentences that are prevalent in the proposed
benchmark data. Evaluated on the official PAN-2025 test datasets, the model
achieves strong macro-F1 scores of 0.923, 0.828, and 0.724 on the EASY, MEDIUM,
and HARD data, respectively, outperforming not only the official random
baselines but also a much more challenging one: claude-3.7-sonnet's zero-shot
performance.

TL;DR: TraceRetriever提出了一种基于有限案例信息的法律先例检索方法，结合多种模型和修辞标注，解决了传统检索方法在复杂法律文档中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律先例检索在普通法体系中至关重要，但传统方法难以应对日益复杂的法律文档。

Method: 结合BM25、向量数据库和Cross-Encoder模型，通过Reciprocal Rank Fusion整合结果，并使用Hierarchical BiLSTM CRF生成修辞标注。

Result: 在IL-PCR和COLIEE 2025数据集上验证，TraceRetriever能有效应对文档量增长和实际搜索限制。

Conclusion: TraceRetriever为法律研究提供了可靠且可扩展的先例检索基础，尤其在仅有部分案例信息时表现优异。

Abstract: Legal precedent retrieval is a cornerstone of the common law system, governed
by the principle of stare decisis, which demands consistency in judicial
decisions. However, the growing complexity and volume of legal documents
challenge traditional retrieval methods. TraceRetriever mirrors real-world
legal search by operating with limited case information, extracting only
rhetorically significant segments instead of requiring complete documents. Our
pipeline integrates BM25, Vector Database, and Cross-Encoder models, combining
initial results through Reciprocal Rank Fusion before final re-ranking.
Rhetorical annotations are generated using a Hierarchical BiLSTM CRF classifier
trained on Indian judgments. Evaluated on IL-PCR and COLIEE 2025 datasets,
TraceRetriever addresses growing document volume challenges while aligning with
practical search constraints, reliable and scalable foundation for precedent
retrieval enhancing legal research when only partial case knowledge is
available.

Abstract: This article explores the zero-shot performance of state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) on one of the most challenging tasks in authorship
analysis: sentence-level style change detection. Benchmarking four LLMs on the
official PAN~2024 and 2025 "Multi-Author Writing Style Analysis" datasets, we
present several observations. First, state-of-the-art generative models are
sensitive to variations in writing style - even at the granular level of
individual sentences. Second, their accuracy establishes a challenging baseline
for the task, outperforming suggested baselines of the PAN competition.
Finally, we explore the influence of semantics on model predictions and present
evidence suggesting that the latest generation of LLMs may be more sensitive to
content-independent and purely stylistic signals than previously reported.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在印度法律背景下常忽略成文法条文和判例的重要性，NyayaRAG旨在填补这一空白，模拟真实法庭场景。

Method: 提出NyayaRAG框架，整合案件描述、法律条文和语义检索的判例，通过领域特定流程评估输入组合的效果。

Result: 实验表明，结合结构化法律知识显著提高了预测准确性和解释质量。

Conclusion: NyayaRAG为法律判决预测提供了更全面的方法，尤其在依赖成文法和判例的体系中表现优异。

Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) has emerged as a key area in AI for law,
aiming to automate judicial outcome forecasting and enhance interpretability in
legal reasoning. While previous approaches in the Indian context have relied on
internal case content such as facts, issues, and reasoning, they often overlook
a core element of common law systems, which is reliance on statutory provisions
and judicial precedents. In this work, we propose NyayaRAG, a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that simulates realistic
courtroom scenarios by providing models with factual case descriptions,
relevant legal statutes, and semantically retrieved prior cases. NyayaRAG
evaluates the effectiveness of these combined inputs in predicting court
decisions and generating legal explanations using a domain-specific pipeline
tailored to the Indian legal system. We assess performance across various input
configurations using both standard lexical and semantic metrics as well as
LLM-based evaluators such as G-Eval. Our results show that augmenting factual
inputs with structured legal knowledge significantly improves both predictive
accuracy and explanation quality.

Result: 在多个KGQA基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DAMR通过自适应路径评估和动态训练机制，实现了高效且上下文感知的KGQA。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to interpret natural language
queries and perform structured reasoning over knowledge graphs by leveraging
their relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Recent
KGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on
GNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation
strategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly
perform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited
adaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement,
while the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate
path evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM
calls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive
MCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search
with adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR
employs a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based
planner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search
space. To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight
Transformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by
jointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention,
enabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop
reasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision,
DAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically
generates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing
the scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning
trajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 探究LLM是否能在缺乏直接训练数据的情况下，通过训练数据中的相关信息进行推理。

Method: 设计实验研究LLM的上下文外推理能力，训练模型学习虚构聊天机器人的名称和行为描述，但不提供对话示例。

Result: GPT 4o能正确推断聊天机器人名称，并在行为描述训练后更准确地模拟其行为。

Conclusion: 结果表明LLM具备情境感知能力，对AI安全有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on large corpora, yet it is unclear
whether they can reason about the information present within their training
data. We design experiments to study out-of-context abduction in LLMs, the
ability to infer the most plausible explanations for observations using
relevant facts present in training data. We train treatment LLMs on names and
behavior descriptions of fictitious chatbots, but not on examples of dialogue
with the chatbots. We find that OpenAI's GPT 4o LLM can correctly infer at
least one chatbot's name after observing example responses characteristic of
that chatbot. We also find that previously training GPT 4o on descriptions of a
chatbot's behavior allows it to display behaviors more characteristic of the
chatbot when iteratively trained to display such behaviors. Our results have
implications for situational awareness in LLMs and, therefore, for AI safety.

Motivation: 研究生成代理能否作为人类参与者的替代品，用于社会科学研究，验证其人格特质的代表性和可靠性。

Method: 通过调查310个GPT-4驱动的代理，进行因子分析，并与2004年HEXACO原始研究结果对比。

Result: 1）代理响应中可恢复一致的人格结构，部分符合HEXACO框架；2）GPT-4内人格维度一致且可靠；3）跨模型分析显示模型特定偏差。

Conclusion: 生成代理在社会科学研究中具有潜力，但需注意模型偏差和设计一致性，以最大化人类特质的覆盖和代表性。

Abstract: Generative agents powered by Large Language Models demonstrate human-like
characteristics through sophisticated natural language interactions. Their
ability to assume roles and personalities based on predefined character
biographies has positioned them as cost-effective substitutes for human
participants in social science research. This paper explores the validity of
such persona-based agents in representing human populations; we recreate the
HEXACO personality inventory experiment by surveying 310 GPT-4 powered agents,
conducting factor analysis on their responses, and comparing these results to
the original findings presented by Ashton, Lee, & Goldberg in 2004. Our results
found 1) a coherent and reliable personality structure was recoverable from the
agents' responses demonstrating partial alignment to the HEXACO framework. 2)
the derived personality dimensions were consistent and reliable within GPT-4,
when coupled with a sufficiently curated population, and 3) cross-model
analysis revealed variability in personality profiling, suggesting
model-specific biases and limitations. We discuss the practical considerations
and challenges encountered during the experiment. This study contributes to the
ongoing discourse on the potential benefits and limitations of using generative
agents in social science research and provides useful guidance on designing
consistent and representative agent personas to maximise coverage and
representation of human personality traits.

Motivation: 传统单步检索的RAG系统在复杂临床推理任务中表现有限，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用代理RAG框架，评估24种不同架构和规模的LLM，使用104个专家问题测试。

Result: 代理检索显著提升诊断准确性（73% vs. 64%），减少幻觉（9.4%），并在46%的案例中检索到相关临床背景。

Conclusion: 代理框架能有效提升放射学QA的事实性和准确性，尤其对中型LLM效果显著，值得进一步临床验证。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial
intelligence (AI), particularly through large language models (LLMs). However,
traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question
answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability
to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG
framework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions,
iteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia, and
dynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 24 LLMs spanning
diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms
(general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104
expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and
ExtendedQA datasets. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic
accuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P<0.001) and conventional
online RAG (73% vs. 68%; P<0.001). The greatest gains occurred in mid-sized
models (e.g., Mistral Large improved from 72% to 81%) and small-scale models
(e.g., Qwen 2.5-7B improved from 55% to 71%), while very large models (>200B
parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally,
agentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically
relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even
clinically fine-tuned models exhibited meaningful improvements (e.g.,
MedGemma-27B improved from 71% to 81%), indicating complementary roles of
retrieval and fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of agentic
frameworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA,
particularly among mid-sized LLMs, warranting future studies to validate their
clinical utility.

Conclusion: GLiDRE是一种高效的文档级关系抽取模型，尤其在少样本场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Relation Extraction (RE) is a fundamental task in Natural Language
Processing, and its document-level variant poses significant challenges, due to
the need to model complex interactions between entities across sentences.
Current approaches, largely based on the ATLOP architecture, are commonly
evaluated on benchmarks like DocRED and Re-DocRED. However, their performance
in zero-shot or few-shot settings remains largely underexplored due to the
task's complexity. Recently, the GLiNER model has shown that a compact NER
model can outperform much larger Large Language Models. With a similar
motivation, we introduce GLiDRE, a new model for document-level relation
extraction that builds on the key ideas of GliNER. We benchmark GLiDRE against
state-of-the-art models across various data settings on the Re-DocRED dataset.
Our results demonstrate that GLiDRE achieves state-of-the-art performance in
few-shot scenarios. Our code is publicly available.

Result: 在多个中文仇恨言论数据集中，MMBERT显著优于微调的BERT模型、LLM及上下文学习方法。

Conclusion: MMBERT通过多模态整合和渐进训练，有效提升了中文仇恨言论检测的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Hate speech detection on Chinese social networks presents distinct
challenges, particularly due to the widespread use of cloaking techniques
designed to evade conventional text-based detection systems. Although large
language models (LLMs) have recently improved hate speech detection
capabilities, the majority of existing work has concentrated on English
datasets, with limited attention given to multimodal strategies in the Chinese
context. In this study, we propose MMBERT, a novel BERT-based multimodal
framework that integrates textual, speech, and visual modalities through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. To address the instability associated
with directly integrating MoE into BERT-based models, we develop a progressive
three-stage training paradigm. MMBERT incorporates modality-specific experts, a
shared self-attention mechanism, and a router-based expert allocation strategy
to enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. Empirical results in
several Chinese hate speech datasets show that MMBERT significantly surpasses
fine-tuned BERT-based encoder models, fine-tuned LLMs, and LLMs utilizing
in-context learning approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval-2025 Task 8: DataBench,
Question-Answering over Tabular Data. The primary objective of this task is to
perform question answering on given tabular datasets from diverse domains under
two subtasks: DataBench QA (Subtask I) and DataBench Lite QA (Subtask II). To
tackle both subtasks, we developed a zero-shot solution with a particular
emphasis on leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-based code generation.
Specifically, we propose a Python code generation framework utilizing
state-of-the-art open-source LLMs to generate executable Pandas code via
optimized prompting strategies. Our experiments reveal that different LLMs
exhibit varying levels of effectiveness in Python code generation.
Additionally, results show that Python code generation achieves superior
performance in tabular question answering compared to alternative approaches.
Although our ranking among zero-shot systems is unknown at the time of this
paper's submission, our system achieved eighth place in Subtask I and sixth
place in Subtask~II among the 30 systems that outperformed the baseline in the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公平和包容性是AI部署中的关键问题，代词使用（特别是性别中立和新代词）是重要挑战。现有研究（如MISGENDERED基准）存在模型过时和评估有限的问题，因此需要更新的研究。

Method: 引入MISGENDERED+基准，测试五种LLMs（GPT-4o、Claude 4、DeepSeek-V3、Qwen Turbo和Qwen2.5）在零样本、少样本和性别身份推理任务中的表现。

Result: 结果显示在二元和性别中立代词上表现显著提升，但在新代词和反向推理任务上仍不一致，表明身份敏感推理存在持续差距。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在代词使用上的进步与不足，为未来包容性AI研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive contexts
where fairness and inclusivity are critical. Pronoun usage, especially
concerning gender-neutral and neopronouns, remains a key challenge for
responsible AI. Prior work, such as the MISGENDERED benchmark, revealed
significant limitations in earlier LLMs' handling of inclusive pronouns, but
was constrained to outdated models and limited evaluations. In this study, we
introduce MISGENDERED+, an extended and updated benchmark for evaluating LLMs'
pronoun fidelity. We benchmark five representative LLMs, GPT-4o, Claude 4,
DeepSeek-V3, Qwen Turbo, and Qwen2.5, across zero-shot, few-shot, and gender
identity inference. Our results show notable improvements compared with
previous studies, especially in binary and gender-neutral pronoun accuracy.
However, accuracy on neopronouns and reverse inference tasks remains
inconsistent, underscoring persistent gaps in identity-sensitive reasoning. We
discuss implications, model-specific observations, and avenues for future

### [135] [Beyond Fixed: Variable-Length Denoising for Diffusion Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00819)
*Jinsong Li,Xiaoyi Dong,Yuhang Zang,Yuhang Cao,Jiaqi Wang,Dahua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DAEDAL是一种无需训练的动态自适应长度扩展策略，解决了扩散大语言模型（DLLMs）静态长度分配的问题，提升了生成效率与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLLMs在应用中受限于静态预定义生成长度，导致性能与计算效率的权衡问题。

Method: DAEDAL分两阶段：1）通过序列完成度量迭代扩展初始长度；2）在去噪过程中动态插入掩码标记扩展不足区域。

Result: 实验显示DAEDAL性能媲美或优于固定长度基线，同时提高计算效率。

Conclusion: DAEDAL解决了DLLMs的静态长度限制，为其与自回归模型的竞争铺平了道路。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) are emerging as a powerful
alternative to the dominant Autoregressive Large Language Models, offering
efficient parallel generation and capable global context modeling. However, the
practical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural
constraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static
length allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths
cripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant
computational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While
the inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses
internal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given
task. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce
DAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive
Length Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two
phases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial
length and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided
by a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL
dynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation
regions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully
developed. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves
performance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned
fixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency
by achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length
constraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap
with their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient
and capable generation.

### [136] [Occlusion-robust Stylization for Drawing-based 3D Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00398)
*Sunjae Yoon,Gwanhyeong Koo,Younghwan Lee,Ji Woo Hong,Chang D. Yoo*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为OSF的遮挡鲁棒风格化框架，用于基于绘图的3D动画，解决了风格化网络在遮挡情况下的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于绘图的3D动画方法在遮挡情况下会导致风格属性（如粗糙轮廓和独特笔触）的质量下降，这是由于训练与推理时的姿态差异（即'风格化姿态间隙'）造成的。

Method: 提出OSF框架，利用光流提供遮挡鲁棒的边缘引导，确保在遮挡情况下仍能保持一致的风格化效果，同时采用单阶段方法提升效率。

Result: OSF在遮挡情况下表现更稳定，推理速度提升2.4倍，内存占用减少2.1倍。

Conclusion: OSF有效解决了风格化网络在遮挡情况下的性能问题，提升了基于绘图的3D动画的质量和效率。

Abstract: 3D animation aims to generate a 3D animated video from an input image and a
target 3D motion sequence. Recent advances in image-to-3D models enable the
creation of animations directly from user-hand drawings. Distinguished from
conventional 3D animation, drawing-based 3D animation is crucial to preserve
artist's unique style properties, such as rough contours and distinct stroke
patterns. However, recent methods still exhibit quality deterioration in style
properties, especially under occlusions caused by overlapping body parts,
leading to contour flickering and stroke blurring. This occurs due to a
`stylization pose gap' between training and inference in stylization networks
designed to preserve drawing styles in drawing-based 3D animation systems. The
stylization pose gap denotes that input target poses used to train the
stylization network are always in occlusion-free poses, while target poses
encountered in an inference include diverse occlusions under dynamic motions.
To this end, we propose Occlusion-robust Stylization Framework (OSF) for
drawing-based 3D animation. We found that while employing object's edge can be
effective input prior for guiding stylization, it becomes notably inaccurate
when occlusions occur at inference. Thus, our proposed OSF provides
occlusion-robust edge guidance for stylization network using optical flow,
ensuring a consistent stylization even under occlusions. Furthermore, OSF
operates in a single run instead of the previous two-stage method, achieving
2.4x faster inference and 2.1x less memory.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: CrossSet是一种用于联合分析两个集合类型维度及其交互的新方法，通过多尺度交互式可视化探索，支持从概览到细节的深入分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集合类型数据的交互式可视化分析是一个有价值的研究领域，但现有方法主要关注单一维度，缺乏对两个维度交互的联合研究。

Method: 采用分层矩阵布局联合可视化两个集合类型维度，支持多尺度交互探索，包括概览、细化维度和深入元素交互。

Result: CrossSet在多个应用场景中验证了其有效性和效率，能够详细分析单一维度、两维度交互以及具体元素关系。

Conclusion: CrossSet为集合类型数据的交互式可视化提供了一种高效的多尺度分析方法，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: The interactive visual analysis of set-typed data, i.e., data with attributes
that are of type set, is a rewarding area of research and applications.
Valuable prior work has contributed solutions that enable the study of such
data with individual set-typed dimensions. In this paper, we present CrossSet,
a novel method for the joint study of two set-typed dimensions and their
interplay. Based on a task analysis, we describe a new, multi-scale approach to
the interactive visual exploration and analysis of such data. Two set-typed
data dimensions are jointly visualized using a hierarchical matrix layout,
enabling the analysis of the interactions between two set-typed attributes at
several levels, in addition to the analysis of individual such dimensions.
CrossSet is anchored at a compact, large-scale overview that is complemented by
drill-down opportunities to study the relations between and within the
set-typed dimensions, enabling an interactive visual multi-scale exploration
and analysis of bivariate set-typed data. Such an interactive approach makes it
possible to study single set-typed dimensions in detail, to gain an overview of
the interaction and association between two such dimensions, to refine one of
the dimensions to gain additional details at several levels, and to drill down
to the specific interactions of individual set-elements from the set-typed
dimensions. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CrossSet, we
have evaluated the new method in the context of several application scenarios.

Motivation: 解决文本到3D生成中因盲目尝试导致的不可预测结果问题，提升多视图一致性和空间理解能力。

Method: 采用双分支结构（检索与生成结合）、多视图混合评分（结合MLLMs和高层次指标）和视觉分析套件。

Result: 在测试和用户研究中，Sel3DCraft在支持设计师创造力方面优于其他系统。

Conclusion: Sel3DCraft通过结构化方法显著提升了文本到3D生成的效率和质量。

Abstract: Text-to-3D (T23D) generation has transformed digital content creation, yet
remains bottlenecked by blind trial-and-error prompting processes that yield
unpredictable results. While visual prompt engineering has advanced in
text-to-image domains, its application to 3D generation presents unique
challenges requiring multi-view consistency evaluation and spatial
understanding. We present Sel3DCraft, a visual prompt engineering system for
T23D that transforms unstructured exploration into a guided visual process. Our
approach introduces three key innovations: a dual-branch structure combining
retrieval and generation for diverse candidate exploration; a multi-view hybrid
scoring approach that leverages MLLMs with innovative high-level metrics to
assess 3D models with human-expert consistency; and a prompt-driven visual
analytics suite that enables intuitive defect identification and refinement.
Extensive testing and user studies demonstrate that Sel3DCraft surpasses other
T23D systems in supporting creativity for designers.

### [139] [SpA2V: Harnessing Spatial Auditory Cues for Audio-driven Spatially-aware Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00782)
*Kien T. Pham,Yingqing He,Yazhou Xing,Qifeng Chen,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SpA2V是一个新框架，通过利用音频中的空间和语义线索生成与输入音频高度对应的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注语义信息，忽略了声音的空间属性（如位置和运动方向），而人类能自然识别这些信息。SpA2V旨在填补这一空白。

Method: SpA2V分两阶段：1）音频引导的视频规划，利用MLLM构建视频场景布局（VSL）；2）布局引导的视频生成，将VSL作为条件输入预训练扩散模型。

Result: 实验表明，SpA2V能生成语义和空间上与输入音频对齐的逼真视频。

Conclusion: SpA2V通过显式利用空间听觉线索，显著提升了视频生成的准确性和真实性。

Abstract: Audio-driven video generation aims to synthesize realistic videos that align
with input audio recordings, akin to the human ability to visualize scenes from
auditory input. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring
semantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the
audio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and
spatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the
semantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded
spatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful
information can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators
derived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or
frequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the
first framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to
generate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes
the generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We
meticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing
spatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts
(VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between
the audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop
an efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional
guidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video
generation in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SpA2V excels in generating realistic videos with semantic and spatial alignment
to the input audios.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Vision-Language-Action models has created an urgent
need for large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration datasets. Although
teleoperation is the predominant method for data collection, current approaches
suffer from limited scalability, complex setup procedures, and suboptimal data
quality. This paper presents XRoboToolkit, a cross-platform framework for
extended reality based robot teleoperation built on the OpenXR standard. The
system features low-latency stereoscopic visual feedback, optimization-based
inverse kinematics, and support for diverse tracking modalities including head,
controller, hand, and auxiliary motion trackers. XRoboToolkit's modular
architecture enables seamless integration across robotic platforms and
simulation environments, spanning precision manipulators, mobile robots, and
dexterous hands. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through precision
manipulation tasks and validate data quality by training VLA models that
exhibit robust autonomous performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in teleoperation have demonstrated robots performing complex

joint-level teleoperation for humanoid robots, limiting the diversity of tasks
that can be accomplished. This work presents Controller for Humanoid Imitation

standard baby carrier, allowing the operator control over all four limbs, and
supports both direct joint mapping for full-body control and loco-manipulation.
Adaptive force feedback is incorporated to enhance operator experience and
prevent unsafe joint movements. We validate the capabilities of this system by
conducting loco-manipulation and full-body control examples on a humanoid robot
and multiple dual-arm systems. Lastly, we open-source the design of the
hardware promoting accessibility and reproducibility. Additional details and

Abstract: This paper presents a topology-inspired morphological descriptor for soft
continuum robots by combining a pseudo-rigid-body (PRB) model with Morse theory
to achieve a quantitative characterization of robot morphologies. By counting
critical points of directional projections, the proposed descriptor enables a
discrete representation of multimodal configurations and facilitates
morphological classification. Furthermore, we apply the descriptor to
morphology control by formulating the target configuration as an optimization
problem to compute actuation parameters that generate equilibrium shapes with
desired topological features. The proposed framework provides a unified
methodology for quantitative morphology description, classification, and
control of soft continuum robots, with the potential to enhance their precision
and adaptability in medical applications such as minimally invasive surgery and
endovascular interventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VLN依赖顺序语言指令，限制了可扩展性和自主性。UAV-ON通过语义目标导航填补这一空白，推动空中智能体在复杂环境中的自主性研究。

Method: UAV-ON包含14个高保真Unreal Engine环境，涵盖多样语义区域和复杂布局，定义了1270个标注目标对象，每个对象通过实例级指令描述。基准测试中实现了Aerial ObjectNav Agent（AOA）等基线方法。

Result: 所有基线方法在UAV-ON中表现不佳，突显了空中导航与语义目标结合的挑战。

Conclusion: UAV-ON为复杂现实环境中基于语义目标的无人机自主性研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Aerial navigation is a fundamental yet underexplored capability in embodied
intelligence, enabling agents to operate in large-scale, unstructured
environments where traditional navigation paradigms fall short. However, most
existing research follows the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) paradigm,
which heavily depends on sequential linguistic instructions, limiting its
scalability and autonomy. To address this gap, we introduce UAV-ON, a benchmark
for large-scale Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) by aerial agents in
open-world environments, where agents operate based on high-level semantic
goals without relying on detailed instructional guidance as in VLN. UAV-ON
comprises 14 high-fidelity Unreal Engine environments with diverse semantic
regions and complex spatial layouts, covering urban, natural, and mixed-use
settings. It defines 1270 annotated target objects, each characterized by an
instance-level instruction that encodes category, physical footprint, and
visual descriptors, allowing grounded reasoning. These instructions serve as
semantic goals, introducing realistic ambiguity and complex reasoning
challenges for aerial agents. To evaluate the benchmark, we implement several
baseline methods, including Aerial ObjectNav Agent (AOA), a modular policy that
integrates instruction semantics with egocentric observations for long-horizon,
goal-directed exploration. Empirical results show that all baselines struggle
in this setting, highlighting the compounded challenges of aerial navigation
and semantic goal grounding. UAV-ON aims to advance research on scalable UAV
autonomy driven by semantic goal descriptions in complex real-world
environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces TopoDiffuser, a diffusion-based framework for
multimodal trajectory prediction that incorporates topometric maps to generate
accurate, diverse, and road-compliant future motion forecasts. By embedding
structural cues from topometric maps into the denoising process of a
conditional diffusion model, the proposed approach enables trajectory
generation that naturally adheres to road geometry without relying on explicit
constraints. A multimodal conditioning encoder fuses LiDAR observations,
historical motion, and route information into a unified bird's-eye-view (BEV)
representation. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that
TopoDiffuser outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining strong
geometric consistency. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of
each input modality, as well as the impact of denoising steps and the number of
trajectory samples. To support future research, we publicly release our code at

Motivation: 传统3D物体扫描方法受限于多相机阵列或激光扫描仪的工作空间，Omni-Scan旨在通过机器人抓取和旋转物体解决这一问题。

Method: 使用双手机器人抓取物体并旋转，结合DepthAnything、Segment Anything和RAFT光流模型去除背景和夹持器遮挡，改进3DGS训练流程以支持遮挡数据集。

Result: 在12种工业和家用物体上检测视觉或几何缺陷，平均准确率达到83%。

Conclusion: Omni-Scan提供了一种高效的全方位3D建模方法，适用于缺陷检测等应用。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGSs) are 3D object models derived from multi-view
images. Such "digital twins" are useful for simulations, virtual reality,
marketing, robot policy fine-tuning, and part inspection. 3D object scanning
usually requires multi-camera arrays, precise laser scanners, or robot
wrist-mounted cameras, which have restricted workspaces. We propose Omni-Scan,
a pipeline for producing high-quality 3D Gaussian Splat models using a
bi-manual robot that grasps an object with one gripper and rotates the object
with respect to a stationary camera. The object is then re-grasped by a second
gripper to expose surfaces that were occluded by the first gripper. We present
the Omni-Scan robot pipeline using DepthAny-thing, Segment Anything, as well as
RAFT optical flow models to identify and isolate objects held by a robot
gripper while removing the gripper and the background. We then modify the 3DGS
training pipeline to support concatenated datasets with gripper occlusion,
producing an omni-directional (360 degree view) model of the object. We apply
Omni-Scan to part defect inspection, finding that it can identify visual or
geometric defects in 12 different industrial and household objects with an
average accuracy of 83%. Interactive videos of Omni-Scan 3DGS models can be

Conclusion: TOP方法有效解决了快速上半身运动导致的平衡问题，提升了人形机器人的操作能力。

Abstract: Humanoid robots have the potential capability to perform a diverse range of
manipulation tasks, but this is based on a robust and precise standing
controller. Existing methods are either ill-suited to precisely control
high-dimensional upper-body joints, or difficult to ensure both robustness and
accuracy, especially when upper-body motions are fast. This paper proposes a
novel time optimization policy (TOP), to train a standing manipulation control
model that ensures balance, precision, and time efficiency simultaneously, with
the idea of adjusting the time trajectory of upper-body motions but not only
strengthening the disturbance resistance of the lower-body. Our approach
consists of three parts. Firstly, we utilize motion prior to represent
upper-body motions to enhance the coordination ability between the upper and
lower-body by training a variational autoencoder (VAE). Then we decouple the
whole-body control into an upper-body PD controller for precision and a
lower-body RL controller to enhance robust stability. Finally, we train TOP
method in conjunction with the decoupled controller and VAE to reduce the
balance burden resulting from fast upper-body motions that would destabilize
the robot and exceed the capabilities of the lower-body RL policy. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated via both simulation and
real world experiments, which demonstrate the superiority on standing
manipulation tasks stably and accurately. The project page can be found at

Abstract: Motion imitation is a pivotal and effective approach for humanoid robots to
achieve a more diverse range of complex and expressive movements, making their
performances more human-like. However, the significant differences in
kinematics and dynamics between humanoid robots and humans present a major
challenge in accurately imitating motion while maintaining balance. In this
paper, we propose a novel whole-body motion imitation framework for a full-size
humanoid robot. The proposed method employs contact-aware whole-body motion
retargeting to mimic human motion and provide initial values for reference
trajectories, and the non-linear centroidal model predictive controller ensures
the motion accuracy while maintaining balance and overcoming external
disturbances in real time. The assistance of the whole-body controller allows
for more precise torque control. Experiments have been conducted to imitate a
variety of human motions both in simulation and in a real-world humanoid robot.
These experiments demonstrate the capability of performing with accuracy and
adaptability, which validates the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: The rapid iteration of autonomous vehicle (AV) deployments leads to
increasing needs for building realistic and scalable multi-agent traffic
simulators for efficient evaluation. Recent advances in this area focus on
closed-loop simulators that enable generating diverse and interactive
scenarios. This paper introduces Neural Interactive Agents (NIVA), a
probabilistic framework for multi-agent simulation driven by a hierarchical
Bayesian model that enables closed-loop, observation-conditioned simulation
through autoregressive sampling from a latent, finite mixture of Gaussian
distributions. We demonstrate how NIVA unifies preexisting sequence-to-sequence
trajectory prediction models and emerging closed-loop simulation models trained
on Next-token Prediction (NTP) from a Bayesian inference perspective.
Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that NIVA attains
competitive performance compared to the existing method while providing
embellishing control over intentions and driving styles.

Motivation: 现有集体决策方法需要所有机器人参与，资源消耗大且无法同时执行其他任务。

Conclusion: SubCDM是一种资源高效的集体决策方法，适用于机器人群体。

Abstract: Collective decision-making is a key function of autonomous robot swarms,
enabling them to reach a consensus on actions based on environmental features.
Existing strategies require the participation of all robots in the
decision-making process, which is resource-intensive and prevents the swarm
from allocating the robots to any other tasks. We propose Subset-Based
Collective Decision-Making (SubCDM), which enables decisions using only a swarm
subset. The construction of the subset is dynamic and decentralized, relying
solely on local information. Our method allows the swarm to adaptively
determine the size of the subset for accurate decision-making, depending on the
difficulty of reaching a consensus. Simulation results using one hundred robots
show that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to using the entire swarm
while reducing the number of robots required to perform collective
decision-making, making it a resource-efficient solution for collective
decision-making in swarm robotics.

Method: 提出了HannesImitationPolicy方法，利用模仿学习从演示数据中训练扩散策略，预测手腕方向和手部闭合动作。同时，构建了HannesImitationDataset数据集，包含多种场景的抓取演示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种物体和条件下均能成功抓取，且在非结构化场景中表现优于基于分割的视觉伺服控制器。

Abstract: Recent advancements in control of prosthetic hands have focused on increasing
autonomy through the use of cameras and other sensory inputs. These systems aim
to reduce the cognitive load on the user by automatically controlling certain
degrees of freedom. In robotics, imitation learning has emerged as a promising
approach for learning grasping and complex manipulation tasks while simplifying
data collection. Its application to the control of prosthetic hands remains,
however, largely unexplored. Bridging this gap could enhance dexterity
restoration and enable prosthetic devices to operate in more unconstrained
scenarios, where tasks are learned from demonstrations rather than relying on
manually annotated sequences. To this end, we present HannesImitationPolicy, an
imitation learning-based method to control the Hannes prosthetic hand, enabling
object grasping in unstructured environments. Moreover, we introduce the
HannesImitationDataset comprising grasping demonstrations in table, shelf, and
human-to-prosthesis handover scenarios. We leverage such data to train a single
diffusion policy and deploy it on the prosthetic hand to predict the wrist
orientation and hand closure for grasping. Experimental evaluation demonstrates
successful grasps across diverse objects and conditions. Finally, we show that
the policy outperforms a segmentation-based visual servo controller in
unstructured scenarios. Additional material is provided on our project page:

Result: 模型像素准确率达80.37%，推理时间673毫秒，适合机器人部署。

Conclusion: OmniUnet在多模态地形感知中表现优异，公开了软件和数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Robot navigation in unstructured environments requires multimodal perception
systems that can support safe navigation. Multimodality enables the integration
of complementary information collected by different sensors. However, this
information must be processed by machine learning algorithms specifically
designed to leverage heterogeneous data. Furthermore, it is necessary to
identify which sensor modalities are most informative for navigation in the
target environment. In Martian exploration, thermal imagery has proven valuable
for assessing terrain safety due to differences in thermal behaviour between
soil types. This work presents OmniUnet, a transformer-based neural network
architecture for semantic segmentation using RGB, depth, and thermal (RGB-D-T)
imagery. A custom multimodal sensor housing was developed using 3D printing and
mounted on the Martian Rover Testbed for Autonomy (MaRTA) to collect a
multimodal dataset in the Bardenas semi-desert in northern Spain. This location
serves as a representative environment of the Martian surface, featuring
terrain types such as sand, bedrock, and compact soil. A subset of this dataset
was manually labeled to support supervised training of the network. The model
was evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving a pixel accuracy
of 80.37% and demonstrating strong performance in segmenting complex
unstructured terrain. Inference tests yielded an average prediction time of 673
ms on a resource-constrained computer (Jetson Orin Nano), confirming its
suitability for on-robot deployment. The software implementation of the network
and the labeled dataset have been made publicly available to support future
research in multimodal terrain perception for planetary robotics.

Abstract: In this work, a control scheme for human-robot collaborative object
transportation is proposed, considering a quadruped robot equipped with the
MIGHTY suction cup that serves both as a gripper for holding the object and a
force/torque sensor. The proposed control scheme is based on the notion of
admittance control, and incorporates a variable damping term aiming towards
increasing the controllability of the human and, at the same time, decreasing
her/his effort. Furthermore, to ensure that the object is not detached from the
suction cup during the collaboration, an additional control signal is proposed,
which is based on a barrier artificial potential. The proposed control scheme
is proven to be passive and its performance is demonstrated through
experimental evaluations conducted using the Unitree Go1 robot equipped with
the MIGHTY suction cup.

Motivation: 解决卒中后步态缺陷患者外骨骼控制的挑战，如人群异质性和数据缺乏。

Method: 使用多任务时间卷积网络（TCN）结合健康人和卒中后患者数据训练模型。

Result: 模型在四名卒中后患者数据上表现良好（R²=0.74±0.13），并在一名患者中验证了实时控制可行性。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法为卒中后外骨骼控制提供了潜在解决方案，但仍需进一步验证。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that exoskeletons controlled through data-driven
methods can dynamically adapt assistance to various tasks for healthy young
adults. However, applying these methods to populations with neuromotor gait
deficits, such as post-stroke hemiparesis, is challenging. This is due not only
to high population heterogeneity and gait variability but also to a lack of
post-stroke gait datasets to train accurate models. Despite these challenges,
data-driven methods offer a promising avenue for control, potentially allowing
exoskeletons to function safely and effectively in unstructured community
settings. This work presents a first step towards enabling adaptive
plantarflexion and dorsiflexion assistance from data-driven torque estimation
during post-stroke walking. We trained a multi-task Temporal Convolutional
Network (TCN) using collected data from four post-stroke participants walking
on a treadmill ($R^2$ of $0.74 \pm 0.13$). The model uses data from three
inertial measurement units (IMU) and was pretrained on healthy walking data
from 6 participants. We implemented a wearable prototype for our ankle torque
estimation approach for exoskeleton control and demonstrated the viability of
real-time sensing, estimation, and actuation with one post-stroke participant.

Motivation: Diffusion Policies在资源受限的移动平台上应用时存在计算效率低和内存占用大的问题。

Result: 实验表明，LightDP在移动设备上实现实时动作预测，性能与现有Diffusion Policies相当。

Conclusion: LightDP为资源受限环境中扩散策略的实际部署迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Diffusion Policies have significantly advanced robotic manipulation tasks via
imitation learning, but their application on resource-constrained mobile
platforms remains challenging due to computational inefficiency and extensive
memory footprint. In this paper, we propose LightDP, a novel framework
specifically designed to accelerate Diffusion Policies for real-time deployment
on mobile devices. LightDP addresses the computational bottleneck through two
core strategies: network compression of the denoising modules and reduction of
the required sampling steps. We first conduct an extensive computational
analysis on existing Diffusion Policy architectures, identifying the denoising
network as the primary contributor to latency. To overcome performance
degradation typically associated with conventional pruning methods, we
introduce a unified pruning and retraining pipeline, optimizing the model's
post-pruning recoverability explicitly. Furthermore, we combine pruning
techniques with consistency distillation to effectively reduce sampling steps
while maintaining action prediction accuracy. Experimental evaluations on the
standard datasets, \ie, PushT, Robomimic, CALVIN, and LIBERO, demonstrate that
LightDP achieves real-time action prediction on mobile devices with competitive
performance, marking an important step toward practical deployment of
diffusion-based policies in resource-limited environments. Extensive real-world
experiments also show the proposed LightDP can achieve performance comparable
to state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies.

Conclusion: 通过大规模视频生成模型，实现了比传统行为克隆更优的性能，为可扩展和数据高效的机器人策略学习铺平了道路。

Abstract: Despite tremendous progress in dexterous manipulation, current visuomotor
policies remain fundamentally limited by two challenges: they struggle to
generalize under perceptual or behavioral distribution shifts, and their
performance is constrained by the size of human demonstration data. In this
paper, we use video generation as a proxy for robot policy learning to address
both limitations simultaneously. We propose Video Policy, a modular framework
that combines video and action generation that can be trained end-to-end. Our
results demonstrate that learning to generate videos of robot behavior allows
for the extraction of policies with minimal demonstration data, significantly
improving robustness and sample efficiency. Our method shows strong
generalization to unseen objects, backgrounds, and tasks, both in simulation
and the real world. We further highlight that task success is closely tied to
the generated video, with action-free video data providing critical benefits
for generalizing to novel tasks. By leveraging large-scale video generative
models, we achieve superior performance compared to traditional behavior
cloning, paving the way for more scalable and data-efficient robot policy
learning.

Motivation: HealthBench依赖专家意见可能引入区域偏见和个体差异，尤其在低收入地区问题更突出，需更公平的评估标准。

Method: 提出基于版本控制临床指南（CPGs）的奖励函数，结合系统评价和GRADE证据评级，改进评分逻辑。

Result: 通过证据加权评分和上下文覆盖逻辑，提升医疗语言模型的临床可信度和全球适用性。

Conclusion: 改进后的方法旨在使医疗AI更透明、可信、伦理合规且全球适用。

Abstract: HealthBench, a benchmark designed to measure the capabilities of AI systems
for health better (Arora et al., 2025), has advanced medical language model
evaluation through physician-crafted dialogues and transparent rubrics.
However, its reliance on expert opinion, rather than high-tier clinical
evidence, risks codifying regional biases and individual clinician
idiosyncrasies, further compounded by potential biases in automated grading
systems. These limitations are particularly magnified in low- and middle-income
settings, where issues like sparse neglected tropical disease coverage and
region-specific guideline mismatches are prevalent.
  The unique challenges of the African context, including data scarcity,
inadequate infrastructure, and nascent regulatory frameworks, underscore the
urgent need for more globally relevant and equitable benchmarks. To address
these shortcomings, we propose anchoring reward functions in version-controlled
Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) that incorporate systematic reviews and
GRADE evidence ratings.
  Our roadmap outlines "evidence-robust" reinforcement learning via
rubric-to-guideline linkage, evidence-weighted scoring, and contextual override
logic, complemented by a focus on ethical considerations and the integration of
delayed outcome feedback. By re-grounding rewards in rigorously vetted CPGs,
while preserving HealthBench's transparency and physician engagement, we aim to
foster medical language models that are not only linguistically polished but
also clinically trustworthy, ethically sound, and globally relevant.

Conclusion: HyperTWTL约束的安全强化学习方法在机器人任务中表现出色，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperproperties for Time Window Temporal Logic (HyperTWTL) is a
domain-specific formal specification language known for its effectiveness in
compactly representing security, opacity, and concurrency properties for
robotics applications. This paper focuses on HyperTWTL-constrained secure
reinforcement learning (SecRL). Although temporal logic-constrained safe
reinforcement learning (SRL) is an evolving research problem with several
existing literature, there is a significant research gap in exploring
security-aware reinforcement learning (RL) using hyperproperties. Given the
dynamics of an agent as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and opacity/security
constraints formalized as HyperTWTL, we propose an approach for learning
security-aware optimal policies using dynamic Boltzmann softmax RL while
satisfying the HyperTWTL constraints. The effectiveness and scalability of our
proposed approach are demonstrated using a pick-up and delivery robotic mission
case study. We also compare our results with two other baseline RL algorithms,
showing that our proposed method outperforms them.

Abstract: The uptake of Artificial Intelligence (AI) impacts the way we work, interact,
do business, and conduct research. However, organizations struggle to apply AI
successfully in industrial settings where the focus is on end-to-end
operational processes. Here, we consider generative, predictive, and
prescriptive AI and elaborate on the challenges of diagnosing and improving
such processes. We show that AI needs to be grounded using Object-Centric
Process Mining (OCPM). Process-related data are structured and
organization-specific and, unlike text, processes are often highly dynamic.
OCPM is the missing link connecting data and processes and enables different
forms of AI. We use the term Process Intelligence (PI) to refer to the
amalgamation of process-centric data-driven techniques able to deal with a
variety of object and event types, enabling AI in an organizational context.
This paper explains why AI requires PI to improve operational processes and
highlights opportunities for successfully combining OCPM and generative,
predictive, and prescriptive AI.

Abstract: In Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, Rank Reversals are a serious problem
that can greatly affect the results of a Multi-Criteria Decision Method against
a particular set of alternatives. It is therefore useful to have a mechanism
that allows one to measure the performance of a method on a set of
alternatives. This idea could be taken further to build a global ranking of the
effectiveness of different methods to solve a problem. In this paper, we
present three tests that detect the presence of Rank Reversals, along with
their implementation in the Scikit-Criteria library. We also address the
complications that arise when implementing these tests for general scenarios
and the design considerations we made to handle them. We close with a
discussion about how these additions could play a major role in the judgment of
multi-criteria decision methods for problem solving.

Abstract: SHACL (SHApe Constraint Language) is a W3C standardized constraint language
for RDF graphs. In this paper, we study SHACL validation in RDF graphs under
updates. We present a SHACL-based update language that can capture intuitive
and realistic modifications on RDF graphs and study the problem of static
validation under such updates. This problem asks to verify whether every graph
that validates a SHACL specification will still do so after applying a given
update sequence. More importantly, it provides a basis for further services for
reasoning about evolving RDF graphs. Using a regression technique that embeds
the update actions into SHACL constraints, we show that static validation under
updates can be reduced to (un)satisfiability of constraints in (a minor
extension of) SHACL. We analyze the computational complexity of the static
validation problem for SHACL and some key fragments. Finally, we present a
prototype implementation that performs static validation and other static
analysis tasks on SHACL constraints and demonstrate its behavior through
preliminary experiments.

Abstract: Despite efforts to mitigate the inherent risks and biases of artificial
intelligence (AI) algorithms, these algorithms can disproportionately impact
culturally marginalized groups. A range of approaches has been proposed to
address or reduce these risks, including the development of ethical guidelines
and principles for responsible AI, as well as technical solutions that promote
algorithmic fairness. Drawing on design justice, expansive learning theory, and
recent empirical work on participatory AI, we argue that mitigating these harms
requires a fundamental re-architecture of the AI production pipeline. This
re-design should center co-production, diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI), and
multidisciplinary collaboration. We introduce an augmented AI lifecycle
consisting of five interconnected phases: co-framing, co-design,
co-implementation, co-deployment, and co-maintenance. The lifecycle is informed
by four multidisciplinary workshops and grounded in themes of distributed
authority and iterative knowledge exchange. Finally, we relate the proposed
lifecycle to several leading ethical frameworks and outline key research
questions that remain for scaling participatory governance.

Result: 这些方法能生成更有效的训练数据，提升模型对学生学习的预测性和实用性。

Conclusion: 呼吁重新思考标注质量，优先考虑有效性和教育影响，而非仅依赖一致性。

Abstract: Humans can be notoriously imperfect evaluators. They are often biased,
unreliable, and unfit to define "ground truth." Yet, given the surging need to
produce large amounts of training data in educational applications using AI,
traditional inter-rater reliability (IRR) metrics like Cohen's kappa remain
central to validating labeled data. IRR remains a cornerstone of many machine
learning pipelines for educational data. Take, for example, the classification
of tutors' moves in dialogues or labeling open responses in machine-graded
assessments. This position paper argues that overreliance on human IRR as a
gatekeeper for annotation quality hampers progress in classifying data in ways
that are valid and predictive in relation to improving learning. To address
this issue, we highlight five examples of complementary evaluation methods,
such as multi-label annotation schemes, expert-based approaches, and
close-the-loop validity. We argue that these approaches are in a better
position to produce training data and subsequent models that produce improved
student learning and more actionable insights than IRR approaches alone. We
also emphasize the importance of external validity, for example, by
establishing a procedure of validating tutor moves and demonstrating that it
works across many categories of tutor actions (e.g., providing hints). We call
on the field to rethink annotation quality and ground truth--prioritizing
validity and educational impact over consensus alone.

Abstract: Power is a key concept in AI safety: power-seeking as an instrumental goal,
sudden or gradual disempowerment of humans, power balance in human-AI
interaction and international AI governance. At the same time, power as the
ability to pursue diverse goals is essential for wellbeing.
  This paper explores the idea of promoting both safety and wellbeing by
forcing AI agents explicitly to empower humans and to manage the power balance
between humans and AI agents in a desirable way. Using a principled, partially
axiomatic approach, we design a parametrizable and decomposable objective
function that represents an inequality- and risk-averse long-term aggregate of
human power. It takes into account humans' bounded rationality and social
norms, and, crucially, considers a wide variety of possible human goals.
  We derive algorithms for computing that metric by backward induction or
approximating it via a form of multi-agent reinforcement learning from a given
world model. We exemplify the consequences of (softly) maximizing this metric
in a variety of paradigmatic situations and describe what instrumental
sub-goals it will likely imply. Our cautious assessment is that softly
maximizing suitable aggregate metrics of human power might constitute a
beneficial objective for agentic AI systems that is safer than direct
utility-based objectives.

However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of
the base LLM, due to its inherently on-policy strategy with LLM's immense
action space and sparse reward. Further, RLVR can lead to the capability
boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this
problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel approach that synergizes internal
exploitation (i.e., Thinking) with external data (i.e., Learning) to achieve
stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models.
RL-PLUS integrates two core components: Multiple Importance Sampling to address
for distributional mismatch from external data, and an Exploration-Based
Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning
paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to
demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. The results
show that RL-PLUS achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing
RLVR methods on six math reasoning benchmarks and exhibits superior performance
on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks. It also achieves consistent and
significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative
improvements ranging from 21.1\% to 69.2\%. Moreover, Pass@k curves across
multiple benchmarks indicate that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability
boundary collapse problem.

*Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MetaAgent是一个基于学习-实践原则的智能代理范式，通过持续自我改进和工具学习提升能力，无需调整模型参数或额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决知识发现任务中传统工作流和端到端代理的局限性，通过自我演化的代理系统实现更鲁棒和通用的性能。

Method: MetaAgent从基础推理和自适应求助能力出发，通过生成自然语言请求、工具路由、自我反思和知识库构建逐步提升能力。

Result: 在GAIA、WebWalkerQA和BrowseCamp等基准测试中，MetaAgent优于工作流基线，并与端到端训练代理性能相当或更优。

Conclusion: MetaAgent展示了自我演化代理系统在知识发现任务中的潜力，为通用智能代理的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this work, we propose MetaAgent, an agentic paradigm inspired by the
principle of learning-by-doing, where expertise is developed through hands-on
practice and continual self-improvement. MetaAgent starts with a minimal
workflow, equipped only with basic reasoning and adaptive help-seeking
abilities. When a knowledge gap is encountered, MetaAgent generates natural
language help requests, which are routed to the most suitable external tool by
a dedicated tool router. As MetaAgent solves tasks, it continually conducts
self-reflection and answer verification, distilling actionable experience into
concise texts that are dynamically incorporated into future task contexts.
Besides, MetaAgent autonomously builds in-house tools and a persistent
knowledge base by organizing its tool-use history, further enhancing its
ability to retrieve and integrate relevant information We term this continual,
data-driven process as \textit{meta tool learning}, through which MetaAgent
incrementally refines its reasoning and tool-use strategies, without changing
model parameters or requiring further post-training. Evaluated on challenging
knowledge discovery benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalkerQA, and BrowseCamp,
MetaAgent consistently outperforms workflow-based baselines and matches or
exceeds end-to-end trained agents, demonstrating the promise of self-evolving
agentic systems for robust, general-purpose knowledge discovery. We provide our
source codes in https://github.com/qhjqhj00/MetaAgent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨生成式代理（如LLM）是否能模拟人类基于内在动机的复杂行为。

Method: 通过任务生成实验，比较人类和LLM（GPT-4o）的响应，分析心理驱动因素对行为的影响。

Result: 人类任务生成受心理驱动因素影响，而LLM生成的任务缺乏社会性和物理性，偏向抽象主题。

Conclusion: LLM与人类认知存在核心差距，需在设计中融入内在动机和物理基础以实现更人性化的代理。

Abstract: Humans constantly generate a diverse range of tasks guided by internal
motivations. While generative agents powered by large language models (LLMs)
aim to simulate this complex behavior, it remains uncertain whether they
operate on similar cognitive principles. To address this, we conducted a
task-generation experiment comparing human responses with those of an LLM agent
(GPT-4o). We find that human task generation is consistently influenced by
psychological drivers, including personal values (e.g., Openness to Change) and
cognitive style. Even when these psychological drivers are explicitly provided
to the LLM, it fails to reflect the corresponding behavioral patterns. They
produce tasks that are markedly less social, less physical, and thematically
biased toward abstraction. Interestingly, while the LLM's tasks were perceived
as more fun and novel, this highlights a disconnect between its linguistic
proficiency and its capacity to generate human-like, embodied goals.We conclude
that there is a core gap between the value-driven, embodied nature of human
cognition and the statistical patterns of LLMs, highlighting the necessity of
incorporating intrinsic motivation and physical grounding into the design of
more human-aligned agents.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注简单图形推理，而VLMs在复杂图形推理和抽象问题解决方面表现不足，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 提出ReasonBench基准，包含1,613个现实智力测试问题，涵盖位置、属性、数量和多元素任务，评估11种主流VLMs，并提出DiaCoT和ReasonTune优化策略。

Result: 实验显示当前VLMs在复杂推理任务中存在显著局限性，优化策略将模型性能提升33.5%。

Conclusion: ReasonBench为VLM评估提供了新工具，优化策略显著提升了模型性能，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of visual language models (VLMs) in graphic
reasoning tasks has become an important research topic. However, VLMs still
show obvious deficiencies in simulating human-level graphic reasoning
capabilities, especially in complex graphic reasoning and abstract problem
solving, which are less studied and existing studies only focus on simple
graphics. To evaluate the performance of VLMs in complex graphic reasoning, we
propose ReasonBench, the first evaluation benchmark focused on structured
graphic reasoning tasks, which includes 1,613 questions from real-world
intelligence tests. ReasonBench covers reasoning dimensions related to
location, attribute, quantity, and multi-element tasks, providing a
comprehensive evaluation of the performance of VLMs in spatial, relational, and
abstract reasoning capabilities. We benchmark 11 mainstream VLMs (including
closed-source and open-source models) and reveal significant limitations of
current models. Based on these findings, we propose a dual optimization
strategy: Diagrammatic Reasoning Chain (DiaCoT) enhances the interpretability
of reasoning by decomposing layers, and ReasonTune enhances the task
adaptability of model reasoning through training, all of which improves VLM
performance by 33.5\%. All experimental data and code are in the repository:

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在执行有害指令时存在安全隐患，研究发现模型已具备安全知识但未在推理中激活。

Method: 提出R1-Act，一种简单高效的后训练方法，通过结构化推理显式触发安全知识。

Result: R1-Act显著提升安全性且保持推理性能，优于现有对齐方法，仅需少量训练资源和时间。

Conclusion: R1-Act在多个LRM模型中验证了其鲁棒性、可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Although large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities on complex tasks, recent studies reveal that these models
frequently fulfill harmful user instructions, raising significant safety
concerns. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of LRM safety
risks and find that models already possess sufficient safety knowledge but fail
to activate it during reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose R1-Act, a
simple and efficient post-training method that explicitly triggers safety
knowledge through a structured reasoning process. R1-Act achieves strong safety
improvements while preserving reasoning performance, outperforming prior
alignment methods. Notably, it requires only 1,000 training examples and 90
minutes of training on a single RTX A6000 GPU. Extensive experiments across
multiple LRM backbones and sizes demonstrate the robustness, scalability, and
practical efficiency of our approach.

TL;DR: CoRGI框架通过视觉验证改进视觉语言模型的多步推理，减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CoT提示在视觉语言模型中生成流畅但缺乏视觉依据的解释，需引入验证机制。

Method: CoRGI采用三阶段流程：生成文本推理链、提取视觉证据、结合文本与视觉生成验证答案。

Result: 在VCR基准测试中，CoRGI提升了Qwen-2.5VL和LLaVA-1.6的性能，生成更事实性解释。

Conclusion: 视觉验证能增强多模态推理的鲁棒性，但事后验证框架存在潜在限制。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise in improving reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs), but it often produces explanations that are
linguistically fluent yet lack grounding in visual content. We observe that
such hallucinations arise in part from the absence of an explicit verification
mechanism during multi-step reasoning. To address this, we propose
\textbf{CoRGI}(\textbf{C}hain \textbf{o}f \textbf{R}easoning with
\textbf{G}rounded \textbf{I}nsights), a modular framework that introduces
visual verification into the reasoning process. CoRGI follows a three-stage
pipeline: it first generates a textual reasoning chain, then extracts
supporting visual evidence for each reasoning step via a dedicated module
(VEVM), and finally synthesizes the textual rationale with visual evidence to
generate a grounded, verified answer. The framework can be integrated with
existing VLMs without end-to-end retraining. We evaluate CoRGI on the VCR
benchmark and find that it improves reasoning performance on two representative
open-source VLM backbones, Qwen-2.5VL and LLaVA-1.6. Ablation studies confirm
the contribution of each step in the verification module, and human evaluations
suggest that CoRGI leads to more factual and helpful explanations. We also
examine alternative designs for the visual verification step and discuss
potential limitations of post-hoc verification frameworks. These findings
highlight the importance of grounding intermediate reasoning steps in visual
evidence to enhance the robustness of multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 传统多智能体协作方法依赖共享模型或通信，限制了通用性。心智理论能帮助智能体理解他人信念和目标，提升协作效率。

Method: 在主动推理框架中，智能体维护自身与他人信念和目标的独立表示，并扩展推理树规划算法以递归探索联合策略空间。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅推动了人工智能的实际应用，还为心智理论提供了计算层面的新见解。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to multi-agent cooperation by implementing theory
of mind (ToM) within active inference. ToM - the ability to understand that
others can have differing knowledge and goals - enables agents to reason about
others' beliefs while planning their own actions. Unlike previous active
inference approaches to multi-agent cooperation, our method neither relies on
task-specific shared generative models nor requires explicit communication,
while being generalisable. In our framework, the ToM-equipped agent maintains
distinct representations of its own and others' beliefs and goals. We extend
the sophisticated inference tree-based planning algorithm to systematically
explore joint policy spaces through recursive reasoning. Our approach is
evaluated through collision avoidance and foraging task simulations. Results
demonstrate that ToM-equipped agents cooperate better compared to non-ToM
counterparts by being able to avoid collisions and reduce redundant efforts.
Crucially, ToM agents accomplish this by inferring others' beliefs solely from
observable behaviour. This work advances practical applications in artificial
intelligence while providing computational insights into ToM.

construction of queries, trajectories, and verifiable answers across four key
domains: web, file, code, and general reasoning. Furthermore, we explore novel
strategies for agent test-time reflection and voting to enhance agent
robustness and performance. We evaluate Cognitive Kernel-Pro on GAIA, achieving
state-of-the-art results among open-source and free agents. Notably, our

Result: 发现形式化数学证明对LLMs更具挑战性，揭示了其推理机制的局限性。

Conclusion: 论文旨在明确当前技术的边界，并提出可能的扩展方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in structured
reasoning and symbolic tasks, with coding emerging as a particular area of
strength. This success has sparked growing interest in applying LLMs to
mathematics, both in informal problem-solving and formal theorem proving.
However, progress in formal mathematics has proven to be significantly more
difficult, despite surface-level similarities between programming and proof
construction. This discrepancy raises important questions about how LLMs
``reason'', how they are supervised, and whether they internally track a notion
of computational or deductive state. In this article, we address the
state-of-the-art of the discipline, focusing on recent models and benchmarks,
and explore three central issues at the intersection of machine learning and
mathematical cognition: (i) the trade-offs between formal and informal
mathematics as training domains; (ii) the deeper reasons why proof generation
remains more brittle than code synthesis; (iii) and the question of whether
LLMs represent, or merely mimic, a notion of evolving logical state. Our goal
is not to draw hard boundaries, but to identify where the current limits lie,
and how they might be extended.

TL;DR: Pro2Guard是一种基于概率可达性分析的主动运行时安全框架，用于预测和预防LLM代理的不安全行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于规则的安全系统（如AgentSpec）缺乏预见性，难以应对长期依赖和分布变化，导致安全风险。

Method: Pro2Guard将代理行为抽象为符号状态，从执行轨迹中学习离散时间马尔可夫链（DTMC），并在运行时预测不安全状态的概率。

Result: 在家庭代理和自动驾驶场景中，Pro2Guard分别实现了93.6%和100%的安全预测成功率，并能提前干预。

Conclusion: Pro2Guard通过主动预测和干预，显著提升了LLM代理的安全性，同时保持任务完成率。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents exhibit powerful autonomous capabilities
across domains such as robotics, virtual assistants, and web automation.
However, their stochastic behavior introduces significant safety risks that are
difficult to anticipate. Existing rule-based enforcement systems, such as
AgentSpec, focus on developing reactive safety rules, which typically respond
only when unsafe behavior is imminent or has already occurred. These systems
lack foresight and struggle with long-horizon dependencies and distribution
shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Pro2Guard, a proactive runtime
enforcement framework grounded in probabilistic reachability analysis.
Pro2Guard abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states and learns a
Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from execution traces. At runtime, it
anticipates future risks by estimating the probability of reaching unsafe
states, triggering interventions before violations occur when the predicted
risk exceeds a user-defined threshold. By incorporating semantic validity
checks and leveraging PAC bounds, Pro2Guard ensures statistical reliability
while approximating the underlying ground-truth model. We evaluate Pro2Guard
extensively across two safety-critical domains: embodied household agents and
autonomous vehicles. In embodied agent tasks, Pro2Guard enforces safety early
on up to 93.6% of unsafe tasks using low thresholds, while configurable modes
(e.g., reflect) allow balancing safety with task success, maintaining up to
80.4% task completion. In autonomous driving scenarios, Pro2Guard achieves 100%
prediction of traffic law violations and collisions, anticipating risks up to
38.66 seconds ahead.

Motivation: 多模态AI模型的“黑盒”特性在高风险应用中限制了其部署，现有解释方法无法精确量化模态间的协同效应。

Method: 提出MultiSHAP框架，基于Shapley交互指数，对细粒度视觉和文本元素的交互进行量化，提供实例级和数据集级解释。

Result: 实验证实MultiSHAP能准确捕捉跨模态推理机制，并在实际案例中展示实用性。

Conclusion: MultiSHAP为复杂多模态AI模型提供了一种通用解释方案，并可扩展至超过两种模态。

Abstract: Multimodal AI models have achieved impressive performance in tasks that
require integrating information from multiple modalities, such as vision and
language. However, their "black-box" nature poses a major barrier to deployment
in high-stakes applications where interpretability and trustworthiness are
essential. How to explain cross-modal interactions in multimodal AI models
remains a major challenge. While existing model explanation methods, such as
attention map and Grad-CAM, offer coarse insights into cross-modal
relationships, they cannot precisely quantify the synergistic effects between
modalities, and are limited to open-source models with accessible internal
weights. Here we introduce MultiSHAP, a model-agnostic interpretability
framework that leverages the Shapley Interaction Index to attribute multimodal
predictions to pairwise interactions between fine-grained visual and textual
elements (such as image patches and text tokens), while being applicable to
both open- and closed-source models. Our approach provides: (1) instance-level
explanations that reveal synergistic and suppressive cross-modal effects for
individual samples - "why the model makes a specific prediction on this input",
and (2) dataset-level explanation that uncovers generalizable interaction
patterns across samples - "how the model integrates information across
modalities". Experiments on public multimodal benchmarks confirm that MultiSHAP
faithfully captures cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, while real-world case
studies demonstrate its practical utility. Our framework is extensible beyond
two modalities, offering a general solution for interpreting complex multimodal
AI models.

Abstract: Pre-consultation is a critical component of effective healthcare delivery.
However, generating comprehensive pre-consultation questionnaires from complex,
voluminous Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) is a challenging task. Direct
Large Language Model (LLM) approaches face difficulties in this task,
particularly regarding information completeness, logical order, and
disease-level synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-stage
LLM-driven framework: Stage 1 extracts atomic assertions (key facts with
timing) from EMRs; Stage 2 constructs personal causal networks and synthesizes
disease knowledge by clustering representative networks from an EMR corpus;
Stage 3 generates tailored personal and standardized disease-specific
questionnaires based on these structured representations. This framework
overcomes limitations of direct methods by building explicit clinical
knowledge. Evaluated on a real-world EMR dataset and validated by clinical
experts, our method demonstrates superior performance in information coverage,
diagnostic relevance, understandability, and generation time, highlighting its
practical potential to enhance patient information collection.

Motivation: 解决当前AI在生成交互式多媒体内容（如游戏）时缺乏自动化评估指标和复杂内容生成能力的挑战。

Method: 提出AVR-Eval评估指标（基于音视频记录）和AVR-Agent多代理系统（生成和优化JavaScript代码）。

Result: AVR-Agent生成的内容在实验中表现优于单次生成，但模型未能有效利用自定义资源和反馈。

Conclusion: 当前模型在利用高质量资源和音视频反馈方面与人类存在差距，揭示了机器与人类内容创作的根本差异。

Abstract: While AI excels at generating text, audio, images, and videos, creating
interactive audio-visual content such as video games remains challenging.
Current LLMs can generate JavaScript games and animations, but lack automated
evaluation metrics and struggle with complex content that normally requires
teams of humans working for many months (multi-shot, multi-agents) using assets
made by artists. To tackle these issues, we built a new metric and a
multi-agent system.
  We propose AVR-Eval, a relative metric for multimedia content quality using
Audio-Visual Recordings (AVRs). An omni-modal model (processing text, video,
and audio) compares the AVRs of two contents, with a text model reviewing
evaluations to determine superiority. We show that AVR-Eval properly identifies
good from broken or mismatched content.
  We built AVR-Agent, a multi-agent system generating JavaScript code from a
bank of multimedia assets (audio, images, 3D models). The coding agent selects
relevant assets, generates multiple initial codes, uses AVR-Eval to identify
the best version, and iteratively improves it through omni-modal agent feedback
from the AVR.
  We run experiments on games and animations with AVR-Eval (win rate of content
A against B). We find that content generated by AVR-Agent has a significantly
higher win rate against content made through one-shot generation. However,
models struggle to leverage custom assets and AVR feedback effectively, showing
no higher win rate. This reveals a critical gap: while humans benefit from
high-quality assets and audio-visual feedback, current coding models do not
seem to utilize these resources as effectively, highlighting fundamental
differences between human and machine content creation approaches.

Motivation: 传统Granger因果性方法假设固定的滞后时间，而变滞后Granger因果性（VLGC）虽然允许时间延迟变化，但未考虑频率依赖性。本文旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: 提出MB-VLGC框架，明确建模频率依赖性因果延迟，并提供理论证明和高效推理流程。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，MB-VLGC显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MB-VLGC框架具有广泛适用性，适用于任何类型的时间序列数据。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in time series is fundamental to many
domains, including neuroscience, economics, and behavioral science. Granger
causality is one of the well-known techniques for inferring causality in time
series. Typically, Granger causality frameworks have a strong fix-lag
assumption between cause and effect, which is often unrealistic in complex
systems. While recent work on variable-lag Granger causality (VLGC) addresses
this limitation by allowing a cause to influence an effect with different time
lags at each time point, it fails to account for the fact that causal
interactions may vary not only in time delay but also across frequency bands.
For example, in brain signals, alpha-band activity may influence another region
with a shorter delay than slower delta-band oscillations. In this work, we
formalize Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality (MB-VLGC) and propose a
novel framework that generalizes traditional VLGC by explicitly modeling
frequency-dependent causal delays. We provide a formal definition of MB-VLGC,
demonstrate its theoretical soundness, and propose an efficient inference
pipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that our
framework significantly outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and
real-world datasets, confirming its broad applicability to any type of time
series data. Code and datasets are publicly available.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence-driven adaptive learning systems are reshaping

neglect user roles and comprehension. This paper proposes a hybrid framework
that integrates traditional XAI techniques with generative AI models and user
personalisation to generate multimodal, personalised explanations tailored to
user needs. We redefine explainability as a dynamic communication process
tailored to user roles and learning goals. We outline the framework's design,
key XAI limitations in education, and research directions on accuracy,
fairness, and personalisation. Our aim is to move towards explainable AI that
enhances transparency while supporting user-centred experiences.

Method: 设计了一个视觉解释系统，结合用户需求和上下文，提供不同风格（视觉vs数字）和粒度（专家vs普通用户）的解释。

Result: 通过30名X用户的公开试点验证其对决策和信任的影响。

Conclusion: 该框架首次在单一流程中联合调整解释风格和粒度，有望提升推荐系统的用户理解和信任。

Abstract: Social media platforms today strive to improve user experience through AI
recommendations, yet the value of such recommendations vanishes as users do not
understand the reasons behind them. This issue arises because explainability in
social media is general and lacks alignment with user-specific needs. In this
vision paper, we outline a user-segmented and context-aware explanation layer
by proposing a visual explanation system with diverse explanation methods. The
proposed system is framed by the variety of user needs and contexts, showing
explanations in different visualized forms, including a technically detailed
version for AI experts and a simplified one for lay users. Our framework is the
first to jointly adapt explanation style (visual vs. numeric) and granularity
(expert vs. lay) inside a single pipeline. A public pilot with 30 X users will
validate its impact on decision-making and trust.

Abstract: Generative models achieve remarkable results in multiple data domains,
including images and texts, among other examples. Unfortunately, malicious
users exploit synthetic media for spreading misinformation and disseminating
deepfakes. Consequently, the need for robust and stable fake detectors is
pressing, especially when new generative models appear everyday. While the
majority of existing work train classifiers that discriminate between real and
fake information, such tools typically generalize only within the same family
of generators and data modalities, yielding poor results on other generative
classes and data domains. Towards a universal classifier, we propose the use of
large pre-trained multi-modal models for the detection of generative content.
Effectively, we show that the latent code of these models naturally captures
information discriminating real from fake. Building on this observation, we
demonstrate that linear classifiers trained on these features can achieve
state-of-the-art results across various modalities, while remaining
computationally efficient, fast to train, and effective even in few-shot
settings. Our work primarily focuses on fake detection in audio and images,
achieving performance that surpasses or matches that of strong baseline
methods.
