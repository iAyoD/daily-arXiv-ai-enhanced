### [1] [Puppeteer: Rig and Animate Your 3D Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10898)
*Chaoyue Song,Xiu Li,Fan Yang,Zhongcong Xu,Jiacheng Wei,Fayao Liu,Jiashi Feng,Guosheng Lin,Jianfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Puppeteer是一个自动化3D模型绑定和动画生成的框架，通过预测骨骼结构和优化动画流程，显著提升了效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决静态3D模型动态化过程中依赖专家干预的问题，推动自动化和高效化的内容生成。

Method: 使用自回归变换器预测骨骼结构，结合注意力机制推断皮肤权重，并通过可微分优化生成动画。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，骨骼预测和皮肤权重质量显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: Puppeteer能够高效处理多样化的3D内容，生成稳定且高质量的动画，解决了现有方法的抖动问题。

Abstract: Modern interactive applications increasingly demand dynamic 3D content, yet
the transformation of static 3D models into animated assets constitutes a
significant bottleneck in content creation pipelines. While recent advances in
generative AI have revolutionized static 3D model creation, rigging and
animation continue to depend heavily on expert intervention. We present
Puppeteer, a comprehensive framework that addresses both automatic rigging and
animation for diverse 3D objects. Our system first predicts plausible skeletal
structures via an auto-regressive transformer that introduces a joint-based
tokenization strategy for compact representation and a hierarchical ordering
methodology with stochastic perturbation that enhances bidirectional learning
capabilities. It then infers skinning weights via an attention-based
architecture incorporating topology-aware joint attention that explicitly
encodes inter-joint relationships based on skeletal graph distances. Finally,
we complement these rigging advances with a differentiable optimization-based
animation pipeline that generates stable, high-fidelity animations while being
computationally more efficient than existing approaches. Extensive evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both skeletal prediction accuracy
and skinning quality. The system robustly processes diverse 3D content, ranging
from professionally designed game assets to AI-generated shapes, producing
temporally coherent animations that eliminate the jittering issues common in
existing methods.

### [2] [Stochastic-based Patch Filtering for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10066)
*Javier Rodenas,Eduardo Aguilar,Petia Radeva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于随机性补丁过滤的少样本学习方法（SPFF），用于解决食物图像因视觉复杂性和多样性导致的分类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食物图像的视觉复杂性和多样性（如不同装饰、光照和视角）导致少样本学习模型难以聚焦关键特征，从而造成误分类。

Method: SPFF通过随机过滤补丁嵌入，保留与类别表示相关性高的补丁，并使用相似性矩阵量化查询图像与支持图像的关系。

Result: 实验表明，SPFF能有效聚焦于类别特异性特征，并在Food-101、VireoFood-172和UECFood-256数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPFF通过过滤无关补丁并聚焦关键特征，显著提升了少样本食物图像分类的性能。

Abstract: Food images present unique challenges for few-shot learning models due to
their visual complexity and variability. For instance, a pasta dish might
appear with various garnishes on different plates and in diverse lighting
conditions and camera perspectives. This problem leads to losing focus on the
most important elements when comparing the query with support images, resulting
in misclassification. To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch
Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that
show greater correlation with the class representation. The key concept of SPFF
involves the stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, where patches less
similar to the class-aware embedding are more likely to be discarded. With
patch embedding filtered according to the probability of appearance, we use a
similarity matrix that quantifies the relationship between the query image and
its respective support images. Through a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate
that SPFF effectively focuses on patches where class-specific food features are
most prominent while successfully filtering out non-relevant patches. We
validate our approach through extensive experiments on few-shot classification
benchmarks: Food-101, VireoFood-172 and UECFood-256, outperforming the existing
SoA methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv3是一种自监督学习模型，通过数据扩展、Gram锚定和后期优化策略，实现了高质量密集特征提取，无需微调即可超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消除手动标注需求，实现跨领域视觉表示学习，推动自监督学习的发展。

Method: 采用数据扩展与模型规模优化，引入Gram锚定解决特征退化问题，应用后期策略增强模型灵活性。

Result: DINOv3在多种视觉任务中表现优异，显著超越现有自监督和弱监督模型。

Conclusion: DINOv3为视觉基础模型提供了可扩展解决方案，适用于多样化任务和资源场景。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of eliminating the need for manual
data annotation, enabling models to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and
larger architectures. By not being tailored to specific tasks or domains, this
training paradigm has the potential to learn visual representations from
diverse sources, ranging from natural to aerial images -- using a single
algorithm. This technical report introduces DINOv3, a major milestone toward
realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies. First, we
leverage the benefit of scaling both dataset and model size by careful data
preparation, design, and optimization. Second, we introduce a new method called
Gram anchoring, which effectively addresses the known yet unsolved issue of
dense feature maps degrading during long training schedules. Finally, we apply
post-hoc strategies that further enhance our models' flexibility with respect
to resolution, model size, and alignment with text. As a result, we present a
versatile vision foundation model that outperforms the specialized state of the
art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces
high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various
vision tasks, significantly surpassing previous self- and weakly-supervised
foundation models. We also share the DINOv3 suite of vision models, designed to
advance the state of the art on a wide spectrum of tasks and data by providing
scalable solutions for diverse resource constraints and deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态学习方法，用于生成变形攻击检测的文本描述，并通过零样本评估展示了其泛化能力和文本预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变形攻击检测是确保人脸识别系统可靠性的关键，本文旨在通过多模态学习提供可理解的文本描述。

Method: 使用对比语言-图像预训练（CLIP）进行零样本评估，设计了十种文本提示，并在公开数据集上进行了广泛实验。

Result: 框架在五种变形生成技术和三种媒介中表现出色，同时能预测最相关的文本片段。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅实现了通用的变形攻击检测，还提供了人类可理解的文本描述，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Morphing attack detection has become an essential component of face
recognition systems for ensuring a reliable verification scenario. In this
paper, we present a multimodal learning approach that can provide a textual
description of morphing attack detection. We first show that zero-shot
evaluation of the proposed framework using Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP) can yield not only generalizable morphing attack detection,
but also predict the most relevant text snippet. We present an extensive
analysis of ten different textual prompts that include both short and long
textual prompts. These prompts are engineered by considering the human
understandable textual snippet. Extensive experiments were performed on a face
morphing dataset that was developed using a publicly available face biometric
dataset. We present an evaluation of SOTA pre-trained neural networks together
with the proposed framework in the zero-shot evaluation of five different
morphing generation techniques that are captured in three different mediums.

### [5] [Interpretable Oracle Bone Script Decipherment through Radical and Pictographic Analysis with LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10113)
*Kaixin Peng,Mengyang Zhao,Haiyang Yu,Teng Fu,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型视觉语言模型的可解释甲骨文破译方法，结合部首分析和象形语义理解，显著提升了零样本破译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在甲骨文破译中忽略了字形与语义的复杂联系，导致泛化性和可解释性不足。

Method: 采用渐进式训练策略，从部首识别到象形分析，并设计部首-象形双匹配机制。

Result: 在公开基准测试中取得Top-10准确率，零样本破译能力优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为未破译甲骨文提供考古参考，具有数字人文和历史研究的应用潜力。

Abstract: As the oldest mature writing system, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) has long posed
significant challenges for archaeological decipherment due to its rarity,
abstractness, and pictographic diversity. Current deep learning-based methods
have made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing
approaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the
semantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability,
especially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this
end, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large
Vision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and
pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings
of OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides
the model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and
mutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design
a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis
results, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment
performance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic
Decipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated
with OBS images and pictographic analysis texts. Experimental results on public
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10
accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. More importantly,
our model delivers logical analysis processes, possibly providing
archaeologically valuable reference results for undeciphered OBS, and thus has
potential applications in digital humanities and historical research. The
dataset and code will be released in https://github.com/PKXX1943/PD-OBS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于深度学习的自动标记方法，用于全身双X射线吸收测量（TBDXA）扫描，并在外部测试数据集中达到99.5%的关键点正确率。该方法用于形状和外观建模（SAM），并与健康标志物关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TBDXA是一种低成本的全身体成像技术，广泛用于身体成分评估，但手动标记关键点耗时且易出错。

Method: 使用1,683个手动标注的TBDXA扫描开发和验证深度学习模型，自动放置关键点。

Result: 在外部测试数据集中达到99.5%的关键点正确率，并成功用于35,928次扫描的SAM建模，与健康标志物关联。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且准确，为身体成分与健康标志物的关系提供了新见解，并开源了相关工具。

Abstract: Total-body dual X-ray absorptiometry (TBDXA) imaging is a relatively low-cost
whole-body imaging modality, widely used for body composition assessment. We
develop and validate a deep learning method for automatic fiducial point
placement on TBDXA scans using 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans. The method
achieves 99.5% percentage correct keypoints in an external testing dataset. To
demonstrate the value for shape and appearance modeling (SAM), our method is
used to place keypoints on 35,928 scans for five different TBDXA imaging modes,
then associations with health markers are tested in two cohorts not used for
SAM model generation using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. SAM feature
distributions associated with health biomarkers are shown to corroborate
existing evidence and generate new hypotheses on body composition and shape's
relationship to various frailty, metabolic, inflammation, and cardiometabolic
health markers. Evaluation scripts, model weights, automatic point file
generation code, and triangulation files are available at

### [7] [MANGO: Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow Approach to Fusion Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10133)
*Thanh-Dat Truong,Christophe Bobda,Nitin Agarwal,Khoa Luu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型多模态注意力归一化流（MANGO）方法，通过可逆交叉注意力层（ICA）和三种新的交叉注意力机制，显式、可解释地学习多模态融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态融合方法依赖Transformer的注意力机制隐式学习特征关联，难以捕捉模态本质特征和复杂结构。

Method: 提出可逆交叉注意力层（ICA）及三种新机制（MMCA、IMCA、LICA），构建归一化流模型。

Result: 在语义分割、图像翻译和电影分类任务中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: MANGO方法显式、可解释地学习多模态融合，性能优越。

Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained much success in recent years. However, current
multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to
implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a
result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each
modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations
of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be
publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable
multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible
Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for
multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in
multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose
three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention
(MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality
Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to
high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different
multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image
translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the
state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.

### [8] [Improving watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) disease classification with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based synthetic and real-field images via a custom EfficientNetV2-L model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10156)
*Nitin Rai,Nathan S. Boyd,Gary E. Vallad,Arnold W. Schumann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了结合少量真实图像与合成图像是否能提升西瓜病害分类模型的性能，发现混合使用效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估生成式AI合成的图像与真实图像结合对农业病害分类模型性能的影响，减少对资源密集型数据收集的依赖。

Method: 使用EfficientNetV2-L模型，比较五种不同比例的真实与合成图像训练集（H0-H4），并采用微调和迁移学习技术。

Result: H3和H4（少量真实图像与大量合成图像结合）的F1分数从0.65提升至1.00，显著提高模型性能。

Conclusion: 合成图像无法完全替代真实图像，混合使用能最大化病害分类模型的性能。

Abstract: The current advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models
have paved the way for new possibilities for generating high-resolution
synthetic images, thereby offering a promising alternative to traditional image
acquisition for training computer vision models in agriculture. In the context
of crop disease diagnosis, GenAI models are being used to create synthetic
images of various diseases, potentially facilitating model creation and
reducing the dependency on resource-intensive in-field data collection.
However, limited research has been conducted on evaluating the effectiveness of
integrating real with synthetic images to improve disease classification
performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether combining a
limited number of real images with synthetic images can enhance the prediction
accuracy of an EfficientNetV2-L model for classifying watermelon
\textit{(Citrullus lanatus)} diseases. The training dataset was divided into
five treatments: H0 (only real images), H1 (only synthetic images), H2 (1:1
real-to-synthetic), H3 (1:10 real-to-synthetic), and H4 (H3 + random images to
improve variability and model generalization). All treatments were trained
using a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and
transfer learning techniques. Models trained on H2, H3, and H4 treatments
demonstrated high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the
weighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying
that the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume
of synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability. Overall,
this validates the findings that synthetic images alone cannot adequately
substitute for real images; instead, both must be used in a hybrid manner to
maximize model performance for crop disease classification.

### [9] [SynSpill: Improved Industrial Spill Detection With Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10171)
*Aaditya Baranwal,Abdul Mueez,Jason Voelker,Guneet Bhatia,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于合成数据的框架，用于提升视觉语言模型（VLMs）在工业泄漏检测等安全关键领域的性能，解决了真实数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私、数据敏感性和事件罕见性，工业泄漏检测等领域的真实数据稀缺，导致传统微调方法难以应用。

Method: 通过高质量合成数据生成管道，结合参数高效微调（PEFT）技术，提升VLM和目标检测器的性能。

Result: 合成数据显著提升了VLM和检测器的性能，使其在未见泄漏场景中表现接近。

Conclusion: 高保真合成数据是解决安全关键领域数据稀缺的有效手段，结合轻量级适配为工业环境提供了一种经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed general-purpose
visual recognition through strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their
performance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as
industrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and
difficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data
sensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional
fine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.
  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a
high-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this
synthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of
VLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object
detectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data
(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than
these detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked
improvements, with their performance becoming comparable.
  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means
to bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of
synthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective,
scalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where
real data is scarce/impractical to obtain.

### [10] [EntropyGS: An Efficient Entropy Coding on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10227)
*Yuning Huang,Jiahao Pang,Fengqing Zhu,Dong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）是一种新兴的视图合成方法，具有快速训练/渲染和高质量视觉效果的优点。本文提出了一种名为EntropyGS的因子化和参数化熵编码方法，用于压缩3DGS高斯属性，实现了30倍的码率降低，同时保持相似的渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS的高斯创建和视图渲染通常在不同时间或设备上进行，因此需要存储/传输和压缩高斯属性。本文旨在通过分析高斯属性的统计特性，提出高效的压缩方法。

Method: 首先对3DGS高斯属性进行相关性和统计分析，发现球谐AC属性遵循拉普拉斯分布，而旋转、缩放和不透明度可以用高斯混合模型近似。基于此，提出了EntropyGS方法，通过估计每个属性的分布参数进行熵编码，并根据属性类型自适应量化。

Result: EntropyGS在基准数据集上实现了约30倍的码率降低，同时保持与输入3DGS数据相似的渲染质量，且编码和解码速度快。

Conclusion: EntropyGS是一种高效的3DGS高斯属性压缩方法，适用于实际应用中的存储和传输需求。

Abstract: As an emerging novel view synthesis approach, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
demonstrates fast training/rendering with superior visual quality. The two
tasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated
over time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of
3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical
analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals
that spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions,
while mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and
opacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with
other attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A
factorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter
proposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute
are estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy
coding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types. EntropyGS
demonstrates about 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining
similar rendering quality compared to input 3DGS data, with a fast encoding and
decoding time.

Abstract: Xenium, a new spatial transcriptomics platform, enables
subcellular-resolution profiling of complex tumor tissues. Despite the rich
morphological information in histology images, extracting robust cell-level
features and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data remains a
critical challenge. We introduce CellSymphony, a flexible multimodal framework
that leverages foundation model-derived embeddings from both Xenium
transcriptomic profiles and histology images at true single-cell resolution. By
learning joint representations that fuse spatial gene expression with
morphological context, CellSymphony achieves accurate cell type annotation and
uncovers distinct microenvironmental niches across three cancer types. This
work highlights the potential of foundation models and multimodal fusion for
deciphering the physiological and phenotypic orchestration of cells within
complex tissue ecosystems.

Abstract: Crack detection plays a crucial role in civil infrastructures, including
inspection of pavements, buildings, etc., and deep learning has significantly
advanced this field in recent years. While numerous technical and review papers
exist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape. These shifts
include transitions in learning paradigms (from fully supervised learning to
semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, domain adaptation
and fine-tuning foundation models), improvements in generalizability (from
single-dataset performance to cross-dataset evaluation), and diversification in
dataset reacquisition (from RGB images to specialized sensor-based data). In
this review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight
representative works. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset collected with
3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive
benchmarking experiments to establish baselines for commonly used deep learning
methodologies, including recent foundation models. Our findings provide
insights into the evolving methodologies and future directions in deep
learning-based crack detection. Project page:

*Haonan Ge,Yiwei Wang,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRFD是一种无需训练的解码方法，通过多区域融合减少视觉语言模型中的幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）因区域信息验证能力有限而产生的文本与视觉输入不一致（幻觉）问题。

Method: 提出Multi-Region Fusion Decoding（MRFD），利用交叉注意力识别显著区域，生成初始响应，基于Jensen-Shannon Divergence（JSD）计算可靠性权重，并通过一致性感知融合区域预测。

Result: 实验表明，MRFD显著减少幻觉现象，提高响应的事实性，且无需模型更新。

Conclusion: MRFD是一种有效的训练无关方法，能显著提升LVLMs的事实性表现。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is
inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify
information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose
Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that
improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD
identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses
for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence
(JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of
per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD
significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without
requiring model updates.

*Yujie Zhao,Jiabei Zeng,Shiguang Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于外观的视线估计（PoG）在个体差异和头部姿态变化下的鲁棒性问题，提出了动态校准策略以提高估计器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于个体差异和头部姿态变化，现有的PoG估计器需要个性化校准，但对头部姿态变化敏感。

Method: 构建MobilePoG基准数据集，分析校准点和头部姿态多样性对估计精度的影响，提出动态校准策略。

Result: 实验表明，校准过程中引入更多头部姿态变化能提升估计器的鲁棒性，动态校准策略优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 动态校准策略通过自然引入头部姿态变化，显著提高了PoG估计器的鲁棒性和用户友好性。

Abstract: Although appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation has improved, the
estimators still struggle to generalize across individuals due to personal
differences. Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate
PoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head
pose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing
calibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.
Specifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial
images from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or
continuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically
analyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences
estimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of
head poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose
variation. Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy
in which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones. This
strategy naturally introduces head pose variation during a user-friendly and
efficient calibration process, ultimately producing a better calibrated PoG
estimator that is less sensitive to head pose variations than those using
conventional calibration strategies. Codes and datasets are available at our
project page.

Abstract: This paper addresses the performance bottlenecks of existing text-driven
image generation methods in terms of semantic alignment accuracy and structural
consistency. A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating
text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The
approach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong
cross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and
image. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge
sketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling.
This enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated
images. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive
loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A
multi-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic
consistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic
experiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are
performed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance
strength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed
method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method
effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity
without increasing computational complexity. It demonstrates a strong ability
to generate semantically clear and structurally complete images, offering a
viable technical path for joint text-image modeling and image generation.

Method: 提出VIFSS方法，结合对比学习和动作分类，并构建FS-Jump3D数据集；引入细粒度标注方案。

Conclusion: 新框架有效解决了花样滑冰跳跃识别的挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Understanding human actions from videos plays a critical role across various
domains, including sports analytics. In figure skating, accurately recognizing
the type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective
performance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level
knowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While
recent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action
Segmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:
the annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the
inherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In
this work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that
explicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic
procedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure
Skating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines
contrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.
For view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first
publicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.
Second, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry
(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the
procedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on
element-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation
levels. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant contrastive pre-training is
particularly effective when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the
practicality of our approach in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI
agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer
from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity,
offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task
customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning
annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning
complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable
questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and
extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric
relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for
visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable
fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment
of visual-language models across reasoning levels.

*Tao Huang,Hongbo Pan,Nanxi Zhou,Shun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于相位一致性加权最小绝对偏差（PCWLAD）的亚像素模板匹配方法，显著提高了多模态光学图像的匹配精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态光学图像匹配因光谱响应的非线性辐射和几何变形差异导致精度下降，需改进匹配方法。

Method: 分两步：粗匹配（SSIM）和精匹配（WLAD），结合相位一致性（PC）和互结构滤波。

Result: 在三种数据集上表现优于现有八种方法，平均匹配精度约0.4像素。

Conclusion: PCWLAD方法在多模态图像匹配中具有高精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: High-accuracy matching of multimodal optical images is the basis of geometric
processing. However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the
nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different
spectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency
weighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method
to improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method
consists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity
index measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,
PCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural
details, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine
matching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models
between two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,
mutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of
noise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the
WLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the
performance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to
infrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and
visible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images. PCWLAD outperformed
existing state-of-the-art eight methods in terms of correct matching rate (CMR)
and root mean square error (RMSE) and reached an average matching accuracy of
approximately 0.4 pixels across all three datasets. Our software and datasets
are publicly available at https://github.com/huangtaocsu/PCWLAD.

Method: InterSyn包含两个模块：INS（联合建模单人及交互行为）和REC（优化角色间的动态协调）。

Result: 实验表明，InterSyn生成的动作序列在文本对齐性和多样性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InterSyn为动作合成设定了新标准，未来将开源代码以推动研究。

Abstract: We present Interleaved Learning for Motion Synthesis (InterSyn), a novel
framework that targets the generation of realistic interaction motions by
learning from integrated motions that consider both solo and multi-person
dynamics. Unlike previous methods that treat these components separately,
InterSyn employs an interleaved learning strategy to capture the natural,
dynamic interactions and nuanced coordination inherent in real-world scenarios.
Our framework comprises two key modules: the Interleaved Interaction Synthesis
(INS) module, which jointly models solo and interactive behaviors in a unified
paradigm from a first-person perspective to support multiple character
interactions, and the Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) module, which
refines mutual dynamics and ensures synchronized motions among characters.
Experimental results show that the motion sequences generated by InterSyn
exhibit higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity compared with
recent methods, setting a new benchmark for robust and natural motion
synthesis. Additionally, our code will be open-sourced in the future to promote
further research and development in this area.

Conclusion: 论文总结了OoD分割的现状，并探讨了未来的研究方向。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and segmentation have attracted growing
attention as concerns about AI security rise. Conventional OoD detection
methods identify the existence of OoD objects but lack spatial localization,
limiting their usefulness in downstream tasks. OoD segmentation addresses this
limitation by localizing anomalous objects at pixel-level granularity. This
capability is crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous
driving, where perception modules must not only detect but also precisely
segment OoD objects, enabling targeted control actions and enhancing overall
system robustness. In this survey, we group current OoD segmentation approaches
into four categories: (i) test-time OoD segmentation, (ii) outlier exposure for
supervised training, (iii) reconstruction-based methods, (iv) and approaches
that leverage powerful models. We systematically review recent advances in OoD
segmentation for autonomous-driving scenarios, identify emerging challenges,
and discuss promising future research directions.

Conclusion: 总结了RL与生成模型交叉领域的开放挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing visual
content, including images, videos, and 3D/4D structures. However, they are
typically trained with surrogate objectives such as likelihood or
reconstruction loss, which often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic
accuracy, or physical realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled
framework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally
structured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in
enhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative
tasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for
visual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control
to its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration
into image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not
only as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning
generation with complex, high-level goals. We conclude with open challenges and
future research directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling.

Result: 在10多个基准上验证，平均性能提升0.9%，技能聚焦子集提升1.5%。

Conclusion: 强调了在指令选择中平衡概念知识与视觉技能的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-language instruction tuning achieves two main purposes: learning
visual concepts and learning visual skills. In this paper, we found that
vision-language benchmarks fall into the dichotomy of mainly benefiting from
training on instructions with similar skills or visual concepts. Inspired by
the discovery, we designed a simple targeted training data selection method to
optimize the performance of a given benchmark. We first extract the
concepts/skills from the benchmark, determine whether the benchmark
predominantly benefits from similar concepts or skills, and finally select
instructions with the most matching concepts/skills. Experiments on 10+
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our targeted data selection method,
showing +0.9\% over the best existing baseline averaged over all benchmarks and
+1.5\% on the skill-focused subset. Our findings underscore the importance of
recognizing the inherent trade-off within instruction selection, which requires
balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge against visual skill.

Abstract: Complex and diverse ultrastructural features can indicate the type,
progression, and prognosis of kidney diseases. Recently, computational
pathology combined with deep learning methods has shown tremendous potential in
advancing automatic morphological analysis of glomerular ultrastructure.
However, current research predominantly focuses on the recognition of
individual ultrastructure, which makes it challenging to meet practical
diagnostic needs. In this study, we propose the glomerular morphometry
framework of ultrastructural characterization (Glo-DMU), which is grounded on
three deep models: the ultrastructure segmentation model, the glomerular
filtration barrier region classification model, and the electron-dense deposits
detection model. Following the conventional protocol of renal biopsy diagnosis,
this framework simultaneously quantifies the three most widely used
ultrastructural features: the thickness of glomerular basement membrane, the
degree of foot process effacement, and the location of electron-dense deposits.
We evaluated the 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types in real-world
diagnostic scenarios, demonstrating good consistency between automatic
quantification results and morphological descriptions in the pathological
reports. Glo-DMU possesses the characteristics of full automation, high
precision, and high throughput, quantifying multiple ultrastructural features
simultaneously, and providing an efficient tool for assisting renal
pathologists.

Conclusion: 雷达融合在安全关键场景中有效提升运动理解和长时轨迹预测能力。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems promise stronger performance through
unified optimization of perception, motion forecasting, and planning. However,
vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather
conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical
challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding
and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance.
To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end
camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through
sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve
strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines
and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the
state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving
tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA),
online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory
planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal
consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop
nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive. We
show the effectiveness of radar-based fusion in safety-critical scenarios where
accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are
essential for collision avoidance. The source code of all experiments is

Conclusion: AtomDiffuser为原子分辨率下材料动态建模提供了新工具，解决了STEM数据解释中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) plays a critical role in
modern materials science, enabling direct imaging of atomic structures and
their evolution under external interferences. However, interpreting
time-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation
effects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and
beam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort
both geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it
difficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model
material dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser,
a time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and
radiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially
varying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or
registration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically
heuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural
evolutions across time. Trained on synthetic degradation processes,
AtomDiffuser also generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data. It further
supports high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment, offering
tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns that correlate with
radiation-induced atomic instabilities.

Abstract: Assessing the alignment of multimodal vision-language models~(VLMs) with
human perception is essential to understand how they perceive low-level visual
features. A key characteristic of human vision is the contrast sensitivity
function (CSF), which describes sensitivity to spatial frequency at
low-contrasts. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired
method to estimate the CSF of chat-based VLMs by directly prompting them to
judge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency. This
methodology is closer to the real experiments in psychophysics than the
previously reported. Using band-pass filtered noise images and a diverse set of
prompts, we assess model responses across multiple architectures. We find that
while some models approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, none fully
replicate both. Notably, prompt phrasing has a large effect on the responses,
raising concerns about prompt stability. Our results provide a new framework
for probing visual sensitivity in multimodal models and reveal key gaps between
their visual representations and human perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成模型因缺乏底层结构信息，常生成空间不一致或扭曲的图像。本文利用内在场景属性（如深度、分割图）来捕捉场景结构，提升生成质量。

Method: 通过预训练估计器从图像数据集中提取内在属性，并用自编码器将其聚合为单一潜在变量。基于预训练的潜在扩散模型（LDM），同时去噪图像和内在属性域，共享信息以保持一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能纠正空间不一致性，生成更自然的场景布局，同时保持基础模型（如Stable Diffusion）的保真度和文本对齐性。

Conclusion: 联合生成图像和内在属性能有效提升空间一致性，为高质量图像生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality
images but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to
limited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In
this work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation
maps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior
approaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as
conditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their
corresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the
underlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic
images. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a
large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for
additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate
various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an
autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models
(LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by
carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect
each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural
layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the
base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

TL;DR: NSegment+ 是一种新颖的数据增强框架，通过解耦图像和标签变换来处理语义分割中的隐式标签噪声，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据集中存在隐式标签噪声（如模糊边界和标注者差异），传统数据增强方法可能放大这些噪声，影响模型泛化能力。

Method: 提出 NSegment+，仅对标签施加弹性变形而不改变图像，以增强模型对标签不一致的鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个数据集（Vaihingen、LoveDA、Cityscapes、PASCAL VOC）上平均 mIoU 提升显著（最高 +3.39）。

Conclusion: NSegment+ 有效解决了隐式标签噪声问题，且可与其他训练技巧结合进一步提升性能。

Abstract: While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or
explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit)
label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous
object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present,
such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data
augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and
its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's
generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel
augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to
address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing
controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving
the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust
representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves
performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in
average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even
without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit
label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other
training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.

Motivation: 现有模型在真实场景中泛化能力不足，主要因数据标注成本高和训练与部署域差异大。

Method: 采用渐进条件扩散模型（PCDMs）生成多样训练样本，并利用CogVLM视觉语言模型过滤低质量样本。

Result: 实验表明PQ-DAF显著提升了少样本条件下的模型性能。

Conclusion: PQ-DAF通过高质量数据增强有效解决了少样本和跨域挑战。

Abstract: Driver distraction detection is essential for improving traffic safety and
reducing road accidents. However, existing models often suffer from degraded
generalization when deployed in real-world scenarios. This limitation primarily
arises from the few-shot learning challenge caused by the high cost of data
annotation in practical environments, as well as the substantial domain shift
between training datasets and target deployment conditions. To address these
issues, we propose a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework
(PQ-DAF) that leverages a vision-language model for sample filtering to
cost-effectively expand training data and enhance cross-domain robustness.
Specifically, we employ a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to
accurately capture key driver pose features and synthesize diverse training
examples. A sample quality assessment module, built upon the CogVLM
vision-language model, is then introduced to filter out low-quality synthetic
samples based on a confidence threshold, ensuring the reliability of the
augmented dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQ-DAF substantially
improves performance in few-shot driver distraction detection, achieving
significant gains in model generalization under data-scarce conditions.

### [31] [Translation of Text Embedding via Delta Vector to Suppress Strongly Entangled Content in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10407)
*Eunseo Koh,Seunghoo Hong,Tae-Young Kim,Simon S. Woo,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，通过在文本嵌入空间中引入delta向量，抑制扩散模型中与特定词强关联的内容，并进一步优化为SSDV方法，显著提升了生成图像的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I扩散模型在生成图像时难以抑制与特定词强关联的内容（如‘查理·卓别林’与‘胡子’），影响了生成图像的准确性。

Method: 提出delta向量修改文本嵌入，削弱不想要内容的影响，并开发SSDV方法将其融入交叉注意力机制，实现更精准的抑制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量和定性指标上均显著优于现有方法，尤其在个性化T2I模型中表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过delta向量和SSDV方法，有效解决了T2I模型中内容抑制的难题，为高质量图像生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant progress in
generating diverse high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these
models still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled
with specific words. For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie
Chaplin", a ``mustache" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not
to include it, as the concept of ``mustache" is strongly entangled with
``Charlie Chaplin". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to
directly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of
diffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text
embedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image,
and we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained
through a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression
with Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention
mechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions
where it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise
suppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which
previous baselines were unable to achieve. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, both
in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics.

TL;DR: SC-Lane是一种新颖的3D车道检测框架，通过自适应融合坡度特征和时序一致性提升高度图估计的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定坡度锚点，难以适应多样化的道路几何形状，因此需要一种更灵活且鲁棒的高度图估计方法。

Method: 提出Slope-Aware Adaptive Feature模块动态预测多坡度特征的融合权重，并通过Height Consistency Module确保时序一致性。

Result: 在OpenLane基准测试中，SC-Lane以64.3%的F-score显著优于现有方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SC-Lane通过自适应坡度特征融合和时序一致性，显著提升了3D车道检测的准确性和稳定性。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SC-Lane, a novel slope-aware and temporally
consistent heightmap estimation framework for 3D lane detection. Unlike
previous approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively
determines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness
to diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive
Feature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image
cues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.
Additionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring
stable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is
crucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of
SC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common
in surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height
assessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work
[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a
rigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane
benchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height
estimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin. For

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于ControlNet的方法在DiTs中引入过多参数和计算成本，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用Flux作为主干网络，设计LoRA风格控制模块和KV-Context增强机制，直接学习控制信号并融合条件特征。

Result: 仅增加0.024%参数和0.029% GFLOPs，实现高效可控生成，性能优于传统方法。

Conclusion: NanoControl在减少计算开销的同时，提升了生成质量和可控性。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in
text-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image
generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet
paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm
introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To
address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer
(NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while
incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in
GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically,
rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style
(low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from
raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation
mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the
backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of
conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that
NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to
conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality
and achieving improved controllability.

TL;DR: STRIDE-QA是一个针对自动驾驶视觉语言模型（VLMs）的大规模视觉问答数据集，填补了现有模型在动态交通场景时空推理上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs基于静态网络图像文本对训练，难以满足动态交通场景的精确时空推理需求。

Method: 构建STRIDE-QA数据集，包含100小时东京多传感器驾驶数据，提供1600万QA对和285K帧，支持物体中心和自我中心推理。

Result: 微调后的VLMs在空间定位和未来运动预测上表现显著提升（55%和28%），而通用VLMs接近零分。

Conclusion: STRIDE-QA为开发更可靠的自动驾驶VLMs奠定了基础。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to
support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their
training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the
precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic
traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale
visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from
an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving
data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the
largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16
million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated
annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object
tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric
reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and
temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle
significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In
contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains,
achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future
motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs.
Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more
reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Conclusion: CRISP通过多层面优化，有效解决了持续视频实例分割的挑战，代码已开源。

Abstract: Continual video instance segmentation demands both the plasticity to absorb
new object categories and the stability to retain previously learned ones, all
while preserving temporal consistency across frames. In this work, we introduce
Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier
attempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise
confusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning,
we model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which
emphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the
specificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an
adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a
learnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an
adjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship
between the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt.
Meanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is
introduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual
prompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the
correlation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a
concise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive
experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that
CRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the
long-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/01upup10/CRISP.

Result: 在DroneVehicle数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DOD-SA通过单模态标注和协作设计，实现了高效的红外-可见光目标检测。

Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection has shown great potential in real-world
applications, enabling robust all-day perception by leveraging the
complementary information of infrared and visible images. However, existing
methods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results
for both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object
Detection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The
architecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative
Teacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality
branch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The
teacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality,
simultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative
design enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to
the unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision.
To further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label
quality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST)
that trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding
the learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch. In
addition, we design a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) to align and pair labels
across modalities, explicitly addressing modality misalignment during training.
Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA).

Motivation: 传统建筑电气布局图缺乏机器可读性，导致大规模解析耗时且易出错，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用预训练的目标检测模型（如YOLOv8）在DELP数据集上进行符号识别，并开发工具SkeySpot。

Result: YOLOv8在DELP数据集上达到82.5%的mAP，SkeySpot实现了实时检测与标准化输出。

Conclusion: 该方法降低了CAD系统依赖和人工标注成本，支持建筑行业的标准化与可持续发展。

Abstract: Legacy floor plans, often preserved only as scanned documents, remain
essential resources for architecture, urban planning, and facility management
in the construction industry. However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans
render large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone.
Automated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the
identification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting
workflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory
compliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans
(DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with
2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation
framework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP
dataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance
with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop
SkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection,
classification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces
structured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable
building information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across
downstream applications and regulatory platforms. By lowering dependency on
proprietary CAD systems and reducing manual annotation effort, this approach
makes the digitisation of electrical layouts more accessible to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, while supporting
broader goals of standardisation, interoperability, and sustainability in the
built environment.

Motivation: 探索人类视觉感知是否源于图像统计，以及生物启发模型能否在没有人类监督的情况下学习感知指标。

Method: 使用PerceptNet架构，端到端优化图像重建任务（如自编码、去噪、去模糊和稀疏正则化）。

Result: 编码器阶段（V1-like层）与人类感知判断高度相关，且在中等噪声、模糊和稀疏性水平下表现最佳。

Conclusion: 视觉系统可能针对特定失真和稀疏性水平进行优化，生物启发模型无需人类监督即可学习感知指标。

Abstract: A number of scientists suggested that human visual perception may emerge from
image statistics, shaping efficient neural representations in early vision. In
this work, a bio-inspired architecture that can accommodate several known facts
in the retina-V1 cortex, the PerceptNet, has been end-to-end optimized for
different tasks related to image reconstruction: autoencoding, denoising,
deblurring, and sparsity regularization. Our results show that the encoder
stage (V1-like layer) consistently exhibits the highest correlation with human
perceptual judgments on image distortion despite not using perceptual
information in the initialization or training. This alignment exhibits an
optimum for moderate noise, blur and sparsity. These findings suggest that the
visual system may be tuned to remove those particular levels of distortion with
that level of sparsity and that biologically inspired models can learn
perceptual metrics without human supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线VSR方法仅利用相邻前一帧进行时间对齐，限制了长时视频建模能力。SSMs因其线性计算复杂度和全局感受野被引入以提升效率和性能。

Method: TS-Mamba通过构建视频轨迹选择相似token，并设计移位SSMs模块（TSMA）进行聚合，辅以轨迹感知损失函数监督轨迹生成。

Result: 在三个VSR测试数据集上，TS-Mamba在多数情况下优于六种基准模型，计算复杂度降低22.7%。

Conclusion: TS-Mamba通过轨迹感知和移位SSMs实现了高效且高性能的在线VSR。

Abstract: Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many
real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current
high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the
existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to
achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of
videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear
computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly
improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper
presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs
(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity
Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.
Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to
select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a
Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed
shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted
SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift
operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial
continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function
to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token
selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used
VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark
models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and
over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will
be available at https://github.com.

Conclusion: 领域随机化与自动编码器质量控制结合，为极有限标注数据的半监督分割提供了有效策略，减轻标注负担。

Abstract: Deep learning segmentation relies heavily on labeled data, but manual
labeling is laborious and time-consuming, especially for volumetric images such
as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While recent domain-randomization
techniques alleviate the dependency on labeled data by synthesizing diverse
training images from label maps, they offer limited anatomical variability when
very few label maps are available. Semi-supervised self-training addresses
label scarcity by iteratively incorporating model predictions into the training
set, enabling networks to learn from unlabeled data. In this work, we combine
domain randomization with self-training to train three-dimensional
skull-stripping networks using as little as a single labeled example. First, we
automatically bin voxel intensities, yielding labels we use to synthesize
images for training an initial skull-stripping model. Second, we train a
convolutional autoencoder (AE) on the labeled example and use its
reconstruction error to assess the quality of brain masks predicted for
unlabeled data. Third, we select the top-ranking pseudo-labels to fine-tune the
network, achieving skull-stripping performance on out-of-distribution data that
approaches models trained with more labeled images. We compare AE-based ranking
to consistency-based ranking under test-time augmentation, finding that the AE
approach yields a stronger correlation with segmentation accuracy. Our results
highlight the potential of combining domain randomization and AE-based quality
control to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation from extremely limited
labeled data. This strategy may ease the labeling burden that slows progress in
studies involving new anatomical structures or emerging imaging techniques.

Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in healthcare, fitness
tracking, and ambient assisted living technologies. While traditional vision
based HAR systems are effective, they pose privacy concerns. mmWave radar
sensors offer a privacy preserving alternative but present challenges due to
the sparse and noisy nature of their point cloud data. In the literature, three
primary data processing methods: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), the Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering
have been widely used to improve the quality and continuity of radar data.
However, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, both individually and in
combination, remains lacking. This paper addresses that gap by conducting a
detailed performance analysis of the three methods using the MiliPoint dataset.
We evaluate each method individually, all possible pairwise combinations, and
the combination of all three, assessing both recognition accuracy and
computational cost. Furthermore, we propose targeted enhancements to the
individual methods aimed at improving accuracy. Our results provide crucial
insights into the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their
integrations, guiding future work on mmWave based HAR systems

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STAS（通过空气传播）是肺腺癌中的一种新型侵袭模式，与肿瘤复发和生存率下降相关，但其诊断因病理特征复杂而容易误诊，亟需高效诊断方法。

Method: 研究收集了多中心病理图像数据，并开发了STAMP框架，采用双分支架构、Transformer编码和多模式注意力聚合模块，动态选择与STAS相关的病理区域。

Result: STAMP在三个数据集上的AUC分别为0.8058、0.8017和0.7928，超越了临床诊断水平。

Conclusion: STAMP框架为STAS诊断提供了高效、准确的解决方案，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Spread through air spaces (STAS) constitutes a novel invasive pattern in lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD), associated with tumor recurrence and diminished survival
rates. However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive
endeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to
its distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features.
Consequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning
models for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological
images from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya
Hospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three
senior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the
STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern
attention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze
and diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images.
Specifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn
STAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces.
Transformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation
modules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology,
suppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global
representations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents

*Jianda Mao,Kaibo Wang,Yang Xiang,Kani Chen*

TL;DR: TweezeEdit是一种无需调优和反转的图像编辑框架，通过正则化整个去噪路径而非依赖反转锚点，实现高效的语义保留和目标对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在图像编辑中过度依赖目标提示而忽略源图像语义，且编辑路径长、效率低。

Method: 使用梯度驱动正则化，通过一致性模型直接注入目标提示语义，缩短编辑路径。

Result: TweezeEdit在语义保留和目标对齐上优于现有方法，仅需12步（1.6秒/次）。

Conclusion: TweezeEdit高效且一致，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models empower users to edit images through
text guidance. However, existing methods often over-align with target prompts
while inadequately preserving source image semantics. Such approaches generate
target images explicitly or implicitly from the inversion noise of the source
images, termed the inversion anchors. We identify this strategy as suboptimal
for semantic preservation and inefficient due to elongated editing paths. We
propose TweezeEdit, a tuning- and inversion-free framework for consistent and
efficient image editing. Our method addresses these limitations by regularizing
the entire denoising path rather than relying solely on the inversion anchors,
ensuring source semantic retention and shortening editing paths. Guided by
gradient-driven regularization, we efficiently inject target prompt semantics
along a direct path using a consistency model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate TweezeEdit's superior performance in semantic preservation and
target alignment, outperforming existing methods. Remarkably, it requires only
12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit), underscoring its potential for real-time
applications.

Motivation: 现有3D高斯溅射方法在优化过程中几何约束不足，导致高频纹理和锐利边界区域的重建模糊。

Method: 通过自适应混合四重子样本计算像素颜色，并引入动态梯度分析的权重策略和梯度差分约束，优化关键区域的几何正则化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法在细节保留和实时渲染效率上达到最优性能，定量指标和感知质量显著提升。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了高频纹理和锐利边界重建模糊的问题，同时保持了实时渲染效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian splatting have significantly improved
real-time novel view synthesis, yet insufficient geometric constraints during
scene optimization often result in blurred reconstructions of fine-grained
details, particularly in regions with high-frequency textures and sharp
discontinuities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization
framework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric
constraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of
quadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency
components. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting
strategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient
analysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric
regularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the
model to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions
requiring refinement while maintaining global consistency. Extensive
experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation, particularly in
preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, while maintaining
real-time rendering efficiency. Quantitative metrics and perceptual studies
confirm statistically significant improvements over baseline approaches in both
structural similarity (SSIM) and perceptual quality (LPIPS).

Abstract: Bolt defect detection is critical to ensure the safety of transmission lines.
However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions
significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose
a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset.
First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which
enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT
Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality
masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is
designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the
bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts
into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery
augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect
bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection
dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive
experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images
generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing
models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which
fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed
method. The code of the project is available at

Abstract: Estimating human dance motion is a challenging task with various industrial
applications. Recently, many efforts have focused on predicting human dance
motion using either egocentric video or music as input. However, the task of
jointly estimating human motion from both egocentric video and music remains
largely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts
human dance motion from both egocentric video and music. In practice, the
egocentric view often obscures much of the body, making accurate full-pose
estimation challenging. Additionally, incorporating music requires the
generated head and body movements to align well with both visual and musical
inputs. We first introduce EgoAIST++, a new large-scale dataset that combines
both egocentric views and music with more than 36 hours of dancing motion.
Drawing on the success of diffusion models and Mamba on modeling sequences, we
develop an EgoMusic Motion Network with a core Skeleton Mamba that explicitly
captures the skeleton structure of the human body. We illustrate that our
approach is theoretically supportive. Intensive experiments show that our
method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes
effectively to real-world data.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is critical for a wide range of computer vision tasks that
go beyond surface-level object detection and classification. Despite notable
advances in relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense reasoning,
existing surveys often address these directions in isolation, lacking a unified
analysis and comparison across reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation
protocols. This survey aims to address this gap by categorizing visual
reasoning into five major types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and
commonsense) and systematically examining their implementation through
architectures such as graph-based models, memory networks, attention
mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems. We review evaluation protocols designed
to assess functional correctness, structural consistency, and causal validity,
and critically analyze their limitations in terms of generalizability,
reproducibility, and explanatory power. Beyond evaluation, we identify key open
challenges in visual reasoning, including scalability to complex scenes, deeper
integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, the lack of comprehensive
benchmark datasets, and reasoning under weak supervision. Finally, we outline a
forward-looking research agenda for next-generation vision systems, emphasizing
that bridging perception and reasoning is essential for building transparent,
trustworthy, and cross-domain adaptive AI systems, particularly in critical
domains such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Conclusion: Med-GLIP-5M和Med-GLIP为医学图像定位提供了统一且通用的解决方案，推动了智能诊断等应用的发展。

Abstract: Medical image grounding aims to align natural language phrases with specific
regions in medical images, serving as a foundational task for intelligent
diagnosis, visual question answering (VQA), and automated report generation
(MRG). However, existing research is constrained by limited modality coverage,
coarse-grained annotations, and the absence of a unified, generalizable
grounding framework. To address these challenges, we construct a large-scale
medical grounding dataset Med-GLIP-5M comprising over 5.3 million region-level
annotations across seven imaging modalities, covering diverse anatomical
structures and pathological findings. The dataset supports both segmentation
and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels, ranging from organ-level
boundaries to fine-grained lesions. Based on this foundation, we propose
Med-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on Med-GLIP-5M. Rather
than relying on explicitly designed expert modules, Med-GLIP implicitly
acquires hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse training data --
enabling it to recognize multi-granularity structures, such as distinguishing
lungs from pneumonia lesions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-GLIP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple grounding
benchmarks. Furthermore, integrating its spatial outputs into downstream tasks,
including medical VQA and report generation, leads to substantial performance
gains. Our dataset will be released soon.

Result: 实验结果表明，GCRPNet在性能上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: GCRPNet通过创新的模块设计和特征整合方法，显著提升了显著目标检测的效果。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces
numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low
contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision
transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim
to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively
integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional
perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to
simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature
representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to
extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement
of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical
graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer
interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing
the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground
and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder
of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and
multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It
performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale
convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing
Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: PSScreen通过创新设计有效解决了多数据集训练中的挑战，提升了模型的泛化能力和检测性能。

Abstract: Leveraging multiple partially labeled datasets to train a model for multiple
retinal disease screening reduces the reliance on fully annotated datasets, but
remains challenging due to significant domain shifts across training datasets
from various medical sites, and the label absent issue for partial classes. To
solve these challenges, we propose PSScreen, a novel Partially Supervised
multiple retinal disease Screening model. Our PSScreen consists of two streams
and one learns deterministic features and the other learns probabilistic
features via uncertainty injection. Then, we leverage the textual guidance to
decouple two types of features into disease-wise features and align them via
feature distillation to boost the domain generalization ability. Meanwhile, we
employ pseudo label consistency between two streams to address the label absent
issue and introduce a self-distillation to transfer task-relevant semantics
about known classes from the deterministic to the probabilistic stream to
further enhance the detection performances. Experiments show that our PSScreen
significantly enhances the detection performances on six retinal diseases and
the normal state averagely and achieves state-of-the-art results on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Codes are available at

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) surgical navigation systems are emerging as the next
generation of intraoperative surgical guidance, promising to overcome
limitations of traditional navigation systems. However, known issues with AR
depth perception due to vergence-accommodation conflict and occlusion handling
limitations of the currently commercially available display technology present
acute challenges in surgical settings where precision is paramount. This study
presents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical
targets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of
simulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the
clinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through
a novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid
in catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft
HoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated
insertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization,
where planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and
real-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is
provided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed
tomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation
of insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision.
System Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload.
Tool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy
measures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations. A free copy of

Result: 在ImageNet-1k数据集上，RAP将FPR95降低7.05%，AUROC提高1.71%。

Conclusion: RAP通过检索增强的提示显著提升了OOD检测性能，验证了其模块和动机的有效性。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the reliable deployment of
machine learning models in-the-wild, enabling accurate identification of test
samples that differ from the training data distribution. Existing methods rely
on auxiliary outlier samples or in-distribution (ID) data to generate outlier
information for training, but due to limited outliers and their mismatch with
real test OOD samples, they often fail to provide sufficient semantic
supervision, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a
novel OOD detection method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP). RAP
augments a pre-trained vision-language model's prompts by retrieving external
knowledge, offering enhanced semantic supervision for OOD detection. During
training, RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers based on joint
similarity with external textual knowledge and uses them to augment the model's
OOD prompts. During testing, RAP dynamically updates OOD prompts in real-time
based on the encountered OOD samples, enabling the model to rapidly adapt to
the test environment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on large-scale OOD detection benchmarks. For
example, in 1-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, RAP reduces the
average FPR95 by 7.05% and improves the AUROC by 1.71% compared to previous
methods. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each module and the underlying motivations of our approach.

Motivation: 解决PTQ性能下降和QAT资源消耗大的问题，提出一种高效且通用的量化方法。

Method: 选择输出差异小的层进行QAT微调，其余层使用PTQ，以补偿量化误差传播。

Result: 在多种3D感知任务中表现优于纯QAT，量化精度提升且资源消耗减少。

Conclusion: PTQAT是一种高效通用的量化方法，适用于多种模型架构和任务。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
represent two mainstream model quantization approaches. However, PTQ often
leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT
imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to
weight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid
quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks.
To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects
critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers.
Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies
before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies,
actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy.
This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their
propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The
proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by
freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal
quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as
well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The
experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including
object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that
our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves
0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains
in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer
weights.

Conclusion: HM-Talker通过混合运动表示和身份无关学习，显著提升了说话头部视频的生成效果。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head video generation enhances user engagement in
human-computer interaction. However, current methods frequently produce videos
with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit
modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit
articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial
movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel
framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.
HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and
explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically
defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize
phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement
Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while
predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate
identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject
generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This
module dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing
identity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip
synchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head
synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.

Abstract: Foundational models have achieved significant success in diverse domains of

transferable to tasks not seen during training. One such foundational model is

Abstract: Referring-based Video Object Segmentation is a multimodal problem that
requires producing fine-grained segmentation results guided by external cues.
Traditional approaches to this task typically involve training specialized
models, which come with high computational complexity and manual annotation
effort. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models open a promising
direction toward training-free approaches. Several studies have explored
leveraging these general-purpose models for fine-grained segmentation,
achieving performance comparable to that of fully supervised, task-specific
models. However, existing methods rely on fixed pipelines that lack the
flexibility needed to adapt to the dynamic nature of the task. To address this
limitation, we propose Multi-Modal Agent, a novel agentic system designed to
solve this task in a more flexible and adaptive manner. Specifically, our
method leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to
generate dynamic workflows tailored to each input. This adaptive procedure
iteratively interacts with a set of specialized tools designed for low-level
tasks across different modalities to identify the target object described by
the multimodal cues. Our agentic approach demonstrates clear improvements over
prior methods on two multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks: RVOS and Ref-AVS.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for
achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of
fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing
both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of
empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and
interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep
understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational
feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable
room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks.
Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial
improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks.
Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual
analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability
serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage,
modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities
of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results.
Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly
consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also
enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner.

TL;DR: EvTurb是一种利用高速事件流解耦模糊和倾斜效应的湍流去除框架，通过两步事件引导网络和真实数据集TurbEvent，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气湍流导致的图像模糊和几何倾斜变形对计算机视觉任务构成挑战，现有方法难以解决其高度不适定性。

Method: EvTurb通过事件积分减少模糊，利用事件流方差图消除倾斜变形，采用两步事件引导网络。

Result: 实验表明，EvTurb在计算效率下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EvTurb通过事件流解耦湍流效应，结合真实数据集，为湍流去除提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades image quality by introducing blur and
geometric tilt distortions, posing significant challenges to downstream
computer vision tasks. Existing single-image and multi-frame methods struggle
with the highly ill-posed nature of this problem due to the compositional
complexity of turbulence-induced distortions. To address this, we propose
EvTurb, an event guided turbulence removal framework that leverages high-speed
event streams to decouple blur and tilt effects. EvTurb decouples blur and tilt
effects by modeling event-based turbulence formation, specifically through a
novel two-step event-guided network: event integrals are first employed to
reduce blur in the coarse outputs. This is followed by employing a variance
map, derived from raw event streams, to eliminate the tilt distortion for the
refined outputs. Additionally, we present TurbEvent, the first real-captured
dataset featuring diverse turbulence scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that EvTurb surpasses state-of-the-art methods while maintaining
computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出P$^3$A框架，针对自动驾驶中的2D目标检测，优化高分辨率数据集的黑盒攻击，引入新评价指标PASR和损失函数LCSL，提升攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒攻击方法在自动驾驶场景中因评价指标和低分辨率数据限制，攻击效果被高估，实际成功率低。

Method: 提出PASR指标、LCSL损失函数和PSPP数据预处理方法，优化高分辨率攻击。

Result: P$^3$A在未见模型和高分辨率数据集上优于现有攻击方法。

Conclusion: P$^3$A框架显著提升攻击实用性和成功率，适用于自动驾驶安全研究。

Abstract: Learning-based autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to
adversarial patches, posing serious safety and security risks in their
real-world deployment. Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success
rate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their
transferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to
query-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically
adopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training
loss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding
boxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the
attack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in
reduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches
trained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on
high-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving
datasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch
Attack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically
optimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric,
Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack
effectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present
a tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack
transferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for
high-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic
Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data
preprocessing step. Extensive experiments show that P$^3$A outperforms
state-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and unseen high-resolution datasets,
both under the proposed practical IoU-based evaluation metric and the previous
mAP-based metrics.

*Daejune Choi,Youchan No,Jinhyung Lee,Duksu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级上采样模块FGA，通过傅里叶特征和注意力机制提升超分辨率图像的高频细节重建能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上采样方法（如Sub-Pixel Convolution）在重建高频细节时表现不佳且易产生混叠伪影，FGA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FGA结合了傅里叶特征MLP、跨分辨率相关注意力层和频域L1损失，以提升频谱保真度和空间对齐。

Result: 在五种超分辨率骨干网络上，FGA仅增加0.3M参数，PSNR平均提升0.12~0.14 dB，频域一致性提升29%。

Conclusion: FGA在减少混叠和保留细节方面表现优异，是传统上采样方法的实用替代方案。

Abstract: We propose Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), a lightweight upsampling module
for single image super-resolution. Conventional upsamplers, such as Sub-Pixel
Convolution, are efficient but frequently fail to reconstruct high-frequency
details and introduce aliasing artifacts. FGA addresses these issues by
integrating (1) a Fourier feature-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for
positional frequency encoding, (2) a cross-resolution Correlation Attention
Layer for adaptive spatial alignment, and (3) a frequency-domain L1 loss for
spectral fidelity supervision. Adding merely 0.3M parameters, FGA consistently
enhances performance across five diverse super-resolution backbones in both
lightweight and full-capacity scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate
average PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and improved frequency-domain consistency by
up to 29%, particularly evident on texture-rich datasets. Visual and spectral
evaluations confirm FGA's effectiveness in reducing aliasing and preserving
fine details, establishing it as a practical, scalable alternative to
traditional upsampling methods.

TL;DR: FIND-Net是一种新型金属伪影减少（MAR）框架，结合频域和空间域处理，显著减少伪影并保留结构细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高密度金属植入物在CT成像中产生伪影，影响诊断和治疗规划，现有深度学习方法难以同时抑制伪影和保留结构细节。

Method: FIND-Net整合快速傅里叶卷积（FFC）层和可训练高斯滤波，在频域和空间域中处理MAR任务。

Result: 在合成数据集上，FIND-Net在MAE、SSIM和PSNR上显著优于现有方法；在真实临床CT扫描中也表现出色。

Conclusion: FIND-Net在MAR任务中表现出优越性能，具有更好的结构保留和临床适用性。

Abstract: Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed
tomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis
and treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved
notable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to
suppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this
challenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary
Kernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain
processing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural
preservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and
trainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both
spatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual
understanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while
maintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that
FIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art
MAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR
improvement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities.
Furthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's
ability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively
suppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's
potential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural
preservation and improved clinical applicability. Code is available at

TL;DR: Chamfer Guidance是一种无需训练的指导方法，利用少量真实样本图像提升生成数据的多样性和质量，同时减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前条件图像生成模型在提升生成质量时牺牲了多样性，限制了其作为合成训练数据的实用性。

Method: 提出Chamfer Guidance，利用少量真实样本图像来表征生成数据的质量和多样性。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k和地理多样性基准测试中，生成多样性和质量均有所提升，仅需2张真实样本即可达到最先进的少样本性能。

Conclusion: Chamfer Guidance显著提升了合成数据的实用性，同时减少了计算成本。

Abstract: Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce
infinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation
quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility
of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based
approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by
focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions
oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and
real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free
guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to
characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by
leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the
generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the
generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2
exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4\% in terms of precision, and 86.4\% in
terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5\% and 92.7\%,
respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the
Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on
synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15\% for in-distribution over
the baselines, and up to 16\% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach
does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31\%
reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling
time.

TL;DR: ChatENV是一个交互式视觉语言模型，结合卫星图像和传感器数据，用于环境监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型忽视环境传感器的因果信号，依赖单一来源的标注，缺乏交互式场景推理。

Method: 构建包含17.7万张图像的数据集，使用GPT-4o和Gemini 2.0标注，并基于Qwen-2.5-VL模型微调。

Result: 在时序和假设推理中表现优异（BERT-F1 0.903），优于现有时序模型。

Conclusion: ChatENV是一个强大的、基于传感器的环境监测工具。

Abstract: Understanding environmental changes from aerial imagery is vital for climate
resilience, urban planning, and ecosystem monitoring. Yet, current vision
language models (VLMs) overlook causal signals from environmental sensors, rely
on single-source captions prone to stylistic bias, and lack interactive
scenario-based reasoning. We present ChatENV, the first interactive VLM that
jointly reasons over satellite image pairs and real-world sensor data. Our
framework: (i) creates a 177k-image dataset forming 152k temporal pairs across
62 land-use classes in 197 countries with rich sensor metadata (e.g.,
temperature, PM10, CO); (ii) annotates data using GPT- 4o and Gemini 2.0 for
stylistic and semantic diversity; and (iii) fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using
efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for chat purposes. ChatENV
achieves strong performance in temporal and "what-if" reasoning (e.g., BERT-F1
0.903) and rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models, while
supporting interactive scenario-based analysis. This positions ChatENV as a
powerful tool for grounded, sensor-aware environmental monitoring.

Method: 分析图像采集参数和变换对视觉编码器的影响，探究这些参数是否被编码并影响预测。

Result: 发现这些参数被系统地编码在视觉表示中，且对语义预测有显著影响，具体效果取决于参数与语义标签的相关性。

Conclusion: 图像采集和处理的细微参数对视觉编码器的性能有重要影响，需在设计模型时予以考虑。

Abstract: Prior work has analyzed the robustness of visual encoders to image
transformations and corruptions, particularly in cases where such alterations
are not seen during training. When this occurs, they introduce a form of
distribution shift at test time, often leading to performance degradation. The
primary focus has been on severe corruptions that, when applied aggressively,
distort useful signals necessary for accurate semantic predictions.
  We take a different perspective by analyzing parameters of the image
acquisition process and transformations that may be subtle or even
imperceptible to the human eye. We find that such parameters are systematically
encoded in the learned visual representations and can be easily recovered. More
strikingly, their presence can have a profound impact, either positively or
negatively, on semantic predictions. This effect depends on whether there is a
strong correlation or anti-correlation between semantic labels and these
acquisition-based or processing-based labels. Our code and data are available

Motivation: 传统跛行检测方法依赖手动设计的运动特征，效率低且准确性有限。本研究旨在通过自动学习运动特征，提高检测效率和准确性。

Method: 使用T-LEAP姿态估计模型提取奶牛行走视频中9个关键点的运动轨迹，并将其输入BLSTM分类器进行二元跛行分类。

Result: 最佳架构的分类准确率达到85%，优于传统方法的80%，且仅需1秒视频数据即可检测跛行。

Conclusion: 结合姿态估计和BLSTM的方法在跛行检测中表现优异，适用于短序列和小数据集。

Abstract: This study presents a lameness detection approach that combines pose
estimation and Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) neural networks.
Combining pose-estimation and BLSTMs classifier offers the following
advantages: markerless pose-estimation, elimination of manual feature
engineering by learning temporal motion features from the keypoint
trajectories, and working with short sequences and small training datasets.
Motion sequences of nine keypoints (located on the cows' hooves, head and back)
were extracted from videos of walking cows with the T-LEAP pose estimation
model. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used as an input to a BLSTM
classifier that was trained to perform binary lameness classification. Our
method significantly outperformed an established method that relied on
manually-designed locomotion features: our best architecture achieved a
classification accuracy of 85%, against 80% accuracy for the feature-based
approach. Furthermore, we showed that our BLSTM classifier could detect
lameness with as little as one second of video data.

Conclusion: SemPT通过属性级知识增强和动态推理，有效平衡了已知类别的区分性和未知类别的迁移性。

Abstract: Visual transfer learning for unseen categories presents an active research
topic yet a challenging task, due to the inherent conflict between preserving
category-specific representations and acquiring transferable knowledge.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs
offer a promising solution. However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on
sparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment
knowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this
limitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that
tackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level
knowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting
strategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating
attribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond
labels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is
applied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from
irrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image
embeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text
embeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to
unseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference
dynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and
attribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation.
Extensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel
generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot
learning.

Abstract: Unifying multiple multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT) tasks draws
increasing attention due to the complementary nature of different modalities in
building robust tracking systems. Existing practices mix all data sensor types
in a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the
data-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint
distribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark
where all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks,
causing \textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to
performance \textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances
in two aspects: \ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is
introduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data,
reducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by
27\%. \ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format,
progressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation
can be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally
aligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further
exploration of injecting CL into the unification process. Extensive experiments
conducted on two baselines and four benchmarks demonstrate the significance of
UniBench300 and the superiority of CL in supporting a stable unification
process. Moreover, while conducting dedicated analyses, the performance
degradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity.
Additionally, modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels
across tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE in MMVOT), offering valuable insights for
future multi-modal vision research. Source codes and the proposed benchmark is
available at \textit{https://github.com/Zhangyong-Tang/UniBench300}.

Method: 提出两阶段训练协议：跨视角对齐调整和地址定位调整，结合卫星图像和街景图像。

Result: AddressVLM在两个数据集上的地址定位准确率分别提高9%和12%。

Conclusion: AddressVLM通过跨视角对齐显著提升细粒度地址定位能力。

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in coarse-grained geo-localization at the country or city level, but they
struggle with fine-grained street-level localization within urban areas. In
this paper, we explore integrating city-wide address localization capabilities
into LVLMs, facilitating flexible address-related question answering using
street-view images. A key challenge is that the street-view visual
question-and-answer (VQA) data provides only microscopic visual cues, leading
to subpar performance in fine-tuned models. To tackle this issue, we
incorporate perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and propose
cross-view alignment tuning including a satellite-view and street-view image
grafting mechanism, along with an automatic label generation mechanism. Then
LVLM's global understanding of street distribution is enhanced through
cross-view matching. Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of
two-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address
localization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA
datasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San
Francisco. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AddressVLM
outperforms counterpart LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in average address
localization accuracy on these two datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: 混合真实与合成数据的策略能高效构建高质量数据集，课程学习进一步优化了模型训练效果。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to the DataCV ICCV Challenge, which
centers on building a high-quality face dataset to train a face recognition
model. The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any
existing public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a
thorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing
mislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
strategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.
We retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation
up to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,
we generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt
engineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate
only one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,
which rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach
fuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of
a diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among
synthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them
early in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to
harder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all
newly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure
no identity leakage. Our method achieves \textbf{1st place} in the competition,
and experimental results show that our dataset improves model performance
across 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于目标尺寸小、强度弱和运动模式复杂，MIRSTD在实际应用中具有挑战性。现有方法通常仅建模低阶特征相关性，且局限于单一时间尺度。

Method: HyperTea包含三个模块：全局时间增强模块（GTEM）、局部时间增强模块（LTEM）和时间对齐模块（TAM），结合了CNN、RNN和HGNN。

Result: 在DAUB和IRDST数据集上的实验表明，HyperTea实现了最先进的检测性能。

Conclusion: HyperTea是首个将CNN、RNN和HGNN结合用于MIRSTD的工作，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: In practical application scenarios, moving infrared small target detection
(MIRSTD) remains highly challenging due to the target's small size, weak
intensity, and complex motion pattern. Existing methods typically only model
low-order correlations between feature nodes and perform feature extraction and
enhancement within a single temporal scale. Although hypergraphs have been
widely used for high-order correlation learning, they have received limited
attention in MIRSTD. To explore the potential of hypergraphs and enhance
multi-timescale feature representation, we propose HyperTea, which integrates
global and local temporal perspectives to effectively model high-order
spatiotemporal correlations of features. HyperTea consists of three modules:
the global temporal enhancement module (GTEM) realizes global temporal context
enhancement through semantic aggregation and propagation; the local temporal
enhancement module (LTEM) is designed to capture local motion patterns between
adjacent frames and then enhance local temporal context; additionally, we
further develop a temporal alignment module (TAM) to address potential
cross-scale feature misalignment. To our best knowledge, HyperTea is the first
work to integrate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), and hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) for MIRSTD,
significantly improving detection performance. Experiments on DAUB and IRDST
demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Our source codes are

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合隐式神经表示和物理信息正则化的方法，用于在胎儿脑MRI中联合重建T2映射数据，减少运动伪影并缩短扫描时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎儿脑MRI中T2映射在0.55T中场强下具有潜力，但现有方法因多次采集和运动伪影导致扫描时间长且效果不佳。

Method: 采用隐式神经表示和物理信息正则化，联合重建多TE数据，减少运动影响并保持解剖和T2定量准确性。

Result: 在模拟胎儿脑和成人数据上表现优异，并首次实现0.55T下胎儿T2映射。

Conclusion: 该方法有望减少每次TE所需的堆叠数量，提高胎儿脑T2映射的效率和准确性。

Abstract: T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI has the potential to improve characterization
of the developing brain, especially at mid-field (0.55T), where T2 decay is
slower. However, this is challenging as fetal MRI acquisition relies on
multiple motion-corrupted stacks of thick slices, requiring slice-to-volume
reconstruction (SVR) to estimate a high-resolution (HR) 3D volume. Currently,
T2 mapping involves repeated acquisitions of these stacks at each echo time
(TE), leading to long scan times and high sensitivity to motion. We tackle this
challenge with a method that jointly reconstructs data across TEs, addressing
severe motion. Our approach combines implicit neural representations with a
physics-informed regularization that models T2 decay, enabling information
sharing across TEs while preserving anatomical and quantitative T2 fidelity. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on simulated fetal brain and in vivo
adult datasets with fetal-like motion. We also present the first in vivo fetal
T2 mapping results at 0.55T. Our study shows potential for reducing the number
of stacks per TE in T2 mapping by leveraging anatomical redundancy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IADGPT的统一框架，用于少样本工业异常检测（FS-IAD），通过三阶段渐进训练策略模拟人类检测方式，并设计了新的数据集支持训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的FS-IAD方法缺乏工业知识和推理能力，无法媲美专业质检员。

Method: 采用三阶段渐进训练策略：前两阶段学习基础工业知识和差异感知，第三阶段基于上下文学习范式提升泛化能力。同时设计图像级和像素级异常评分策略。

Result: 实验表明IADGPT在异常检测中表现优异，在定位和推理任务中也具竞争力。

Conclusion: IADGPT通过模拟人类检测方式，显著提升了FS-IAD的性能，并提供了新的数据集支持未来研究。

Abstract: Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD) has important applications in
automating industrial quality inspection. Recently, some FS-IAD methods based
on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some
achievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs
focus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning
capabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human
quality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified
framework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while
also handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and
novel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive
training strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages
gradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and
discrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context
learning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image
as the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we
design a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level
anomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in
conjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To
support our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across
400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level
textual annotations. Experiments indicate IADGPT achieves considerable
performance gains in anomaly detection and demonstrates competitiveness in
anomaly localization and reasoning. We will release our dataset in
camera-ready.

*Sehajdeep SIngh,A V Subramanyam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级视图转换框架TUNet，利用预训练扩散模型生成高质量新视图，解决了现有方法模糊和泛化差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单张图像合成新视图具有挑战性，现有方法成本高且效果不佳，因此探索了一种轻量级解决方案。

Method: 使用DDIM反演潜在空间和相机姿态条件转换U-Net（TUNet）预测目标视图潜在，并通过融合策略保留细节。

Result: 在MVImgNet上实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，生成视图更清晰。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效利用了预训练扩散模型，实现了高质量新视图合成。

Abstract: Synthesizing novel views from a single input image is a challenging task. It
requires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in
occluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many
existing methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views
or train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive.
Additionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization.
This gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view
translation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative
capabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from
a novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ
a camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted
latent corresponding to the desired target view. However, the image sampled
using the predicted latent may result in a blurry reconstruction. To this end,
we propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation
structure observed in DDIM inversion. The proposed fusion strategy helps
preserve the texture and fine-grained details. To synthesize the novel view, we
use the fused latent as the initial condition for DDIM sampling, leveraging the
generative prior of the pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments on
MVImgNet demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

### [75] [Beyond conventional vision: RGB-event fusion for robust object detection in dynamic traffic scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10704)
*Zhanwen Liu,Yujing Sun,Yang Wang,Nan Yang,Shengbo Eben Li,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合事件相机和RGB相机的运动线索融合网络（MCFNet），用于解决复杂交通环境中动态范围限制导致的特征提取问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB相机在复杂交通环境（如夜间驾驶、隧道）中动态范围有限，导致全局对比度降低和高频细节丢失，影响目标检测性能。

Method: 通过事件校正模块（ECM）和时间动态上采样模块（EDUM）实现事件流与图像帧的时空对齐，并利用跨模态Mamba融合模块（CMM）进行自适应特征融合。

Result: 在DSEC-Det和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上，MCFNet显著优于现有方法，特别是在DSEC-Det上mAP50和mAP分别提升7.4%和1.7%。

Conclusion: MCFNet通过结合事件相机的高动态范围信息和RGB相机的空间细节，显著提升了复杂光照条件下的目标检测性能。

Abstract: The dynamic range limitation of conventional RGB cameras reduces global
contrast and causes loss of high-frequency details such as textures and edges
in complex traffic environments (e.g., nighttime driving, tunnels), hindering
discriminative feature extraction and degrading frame-based object detection.
To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to
provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network
(MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive
cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event
correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image
frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection
network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling
module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image
structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba
fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced
scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for
robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD
datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in
various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the
DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best
existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively. The
code is available at https://github.com/Charm11492/MCFNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CountCluster的方法，通过优化对象交叉注意力图的分区，无需外部工具或额外训练即可准确生成指定数量的对象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在生成图像时难以准确反映输入提示中的对象数量，且现有方法依赖外部模块或忽略早期去噪步骤的关键作用。

Method: CountCluster通过将对象交叉注意力图分区为k个簇，定义理想分布并优化潜在空间以对齐目标分布。

Result: 方法在对象数量准确性上平均提升18.5%，并在多种提示下表现出优越的数量控制性能。

Conclusion: CountCluster通过优化注意力图分区，显著提升了生成图像中对象数量的准确性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong
performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still
struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects
specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely
on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity
representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they
still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects
and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object
instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps
of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image
generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at
the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region
should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose
\textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to
be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without
relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method
partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time
based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster
is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target
distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object
count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity
control performance across a variety of prompts. Code will be released at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时监测海上船只的需求受限于原始数据下传和地面处理的延迟，而卫星资源有限，传统算法难以满足要求。

Result: 验证了模型在FPGA上部署的可行性，并成功实现了船只与风力发电机的二元分类。

Conclusion: 神经网络方法为卫星上的实时SAR数据处理提供了可行方案，缓解了带宽和延迟问题。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables large-scale surveillance of
maritime vessels. However, near-real-time monitoring is currently constrained
by the need to downlink all raw data, perform image focusing, and subsequently
analyze it on the ground. On-board processing to generate higher-level products
could reduce the data volume that needs to be downlinked, alleviating bandwidth
constraints and minimizing latency. However, traditional image focusing and
processing algorithms face challenges due to the satellite's limited memory,
processing power, and computational resources. This work proposes and evaluates
neural networks designed for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data acquired
in Stripmap and Interferometric Wide (IW) modes captured with Sentinel-1. Our
results demonstrate the feasibility of using one of our models for on-board
processing and deployment on an FPGA. Additionally, by investigating a binary
classification task between ships and windmills, we demonstrate that target
classification is possible.

Conclusion: 论文通过改进跨视角图像匹配，提升了定位的准确性和可解释性，并发布了首个带有像素级对应标注的跨视角图像对基准数据集CVFM。

Abstract: Cross-view localization aims to estimate the 3 degrees of freedom pose of a
ground-view image by registering it to aerial or satellite imagery. It is
essential in GNSS-denied environments such as urban canyons and disaster zones.
Existing methods either regress poses directly or align features in a shared
bird's-eye view (BEV) space, both built upon accurate spatial correspondences
between perspectives. However, these methods fail to establish strict
cross-view correspondences, yielding only coarse or geometrically inconsistent
matches. Consequently, fine-grained image matching between ground and aerial
views remains an unsolved problem, which in turn constrains the
interpretability of localization results. In this paper, we revisit cross-view
localization from the perspective of cross-view image matching and propose a
novel framework that improves both matching and localization. Specifically, we
introduce a Surface Model to model visible regions for accurate BEV projection,
and a SimRefiner module to refine the similarity matrix through local-global
residual correction, eliminating the reliance on post-processing like RANSAC.
To further support research in this area, we introduce CVFM, the first
benchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level
correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
substantially improves both localization accuracy and image matching quality,
setting new baselines under extreme viewpoint disparity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归图像生成系统仅利用码本中的索引值，而忽略了码本中丰富的令牌相似性信息。k-means聚类在码本特征空间中表现不佳。

Method: 提出DCPE方法，采用基于实例的距离替代传统的基于质心的距离，并通过聚合合并技术解决令牌空间差异问题。

Result: DCPE能够无缝集成现有系统，将自回归模型的训练速度提升42%，并改善了FID和IS性能。

Conclusion: DCPE是一种高效且即插即用的方法，能够更好地利用码本先验信息，提升图像生成模型的性能。

Abstract: Advanced discrete token-based autoregressive image generation systems first
tokenize images into sequences of token indices with a codebook, and then model
these sequences in an autoregressive paradigm. While autoregressive generative
models are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook,
which contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent
studies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means
clustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative
models with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering
performs poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including
token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we
propose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to
k-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token
similarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly
used centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate
for the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance.
Using an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space
disparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating
low-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play
and integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms. With
the discriminative prior extracted, DCPE accelerates the training of
autoregressive models by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves final FID and IS
performance.

Method: 构建EgoCross基准，涵盖手术、工业等四个领域，包含1,000个QA对，支持OpenQA和CloseQA评估。

Result: 实验表明现有MLLMs在跨域场景中表现不佳，尝试了微调和强化学习以改进。

Conclusion: EgoCross为提升跨域鲁棒性提供了基础，数据和代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly pushed the frontier of egocentric video question answering
(EgocentricQA). However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to
common daily activities such as cooking and cleaning. In contrast, real-world
deployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ
substantially in both visual style and semantic content. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four
diverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports,
and animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application
scenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips,
spanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and
counting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support
fine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs,
whether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to
domains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models.
Furthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \eg, fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and
our accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing
domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding. Data and codes will be

Conclusion: ConGCD通过模仿人类认知过程，提出了一种新的共识感知范式，显著提升了广义类别发现的性能。

Abstract: Human perceptual systems excel at inducing and recognizing objects across
both known and novel categories, a capability far beyond current machine
learning frameworks. While generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to bridge
this gap, existing methods predominantly focus on optimizing objective
functions. We present an orthogonal solution, inspired by the human cognitive
process for novel object understanding: decomposing objects into visual
primitives and establishing cross-knowledge comparisons. We propose ConGCD,
which establishes primitive-oriented representations through high-level
semantic reconstruction, binding intra-class shared attributes via
deconstruction. Mirroring human preference diversity in visual processing,
where distinct individuals leverage dominant or contextual cues, we implement
dominant and contextual consensus units to capture class-discriminative
patterns and inherent distributional invariants, respectively. A consensus
scheduler dynamically optimizes activation pathways, with final predictions
emerging through multiplex consensus integration. Extensive evaluations across
coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness as a
consensus-aware paradigm. Code is available at github.com/lytang63/ConGCD.

Abstract: This paper presents a summary of the 2025 Sclera Segmentation Benchmarking
Competition (SSBC), which focused on the development of privacy-preserving
sclera-segmentation models trained using synthetically generated ocular images.
The goal of the competition was to evaluate how well models trained on
synthetic data perform in comparison to those trained on real-world datasets.
The competition featured two tracks: $(i)$ one relying solely on synthetic data
for model development, and $(ii)$ one combining/mixing synthetic with (a
limited amount of) real-world data. A total of nine research groups submitted
diverse segmentation models, employing a variety of architectural designs,
including transformer-based solutions, lightweight models, and segmentation
networks guided by generative frameworks. Experiments were conducted across
three evaluation datasets containing both synthetic and real-world images,
collected under diverse conditions. Results show that models trained entirely
on synthetic data can achieve competitive performance, particularly when
dedicated training strategies are employed, as evidenced by the top performing
models that achieved $F_1$ scores of over $0.8$ in the synthetic data track.
Moreover, performance gains in the mixed track were often driven more by
methodological choices rather than by the inclusion of real data, highlighting
the promise of synthetic data for privacy-aware biometric development. The code

Abstract: Symmetry is a fundamental concept that has been extensively studied, yet
detecting it in complex scenes remains a significant challenge in computer
vision. Recent heatmap-based approaches can localize potential regions of
symmetry axes but often lack precision in identifying individual axes. In this
work, we propose a novel framework for axis-level detection of the two most
common symmetry types-reflection and rotation-by representing them as explicit
geometric primitives, i.e. lines and points. Our method employs a dual-branch
architecture that is equivariant to the dihedral group, with each branch
specialized to exploit the structure of dihedral group-equivariant features for
its respective symmetry type. For reflection symmetry, we introduce
orientational anchors, aligned with group components, to enable
orientation-specific detection, and a reflectional matching that measures
similarity between patterns and their mirrored counterparts across candidate
axes. For rotational symmetry, we propose a rotational matching that compares
patterns at fixed angular intervals to identify rotational centers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing approaches.

failing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against
sophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a
novel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of
hyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises
over 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse,
state-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion,
CogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary
architectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging
subsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal
annotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and
Low-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting
downstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive
experiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection
capabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the
dataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization
capabilities of existing models. In essence, AEGIS establishes an indispensable
evaluation benchmark, fundamentally advancing research toward developing
genuinely robust, reliable, broadly generalizable video authenticity detection
methodologies capable of addressing real-world forgery threats. Our dataset is
available on https://huggingface.co/datasets/Clarifiedfish/AEGIS.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FGL的策略和DPNet网络，用于提升深度伪造检测的泛化能力，应对未知伪造技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测方法在未知伪造技术上表现不佳，亟需提升泛化能力。

Method: 采用FGL策略捕获已知与未知伪造技术的差异信息，设计DPNet网络动态感知伪造痕迹。

Result: 实验表明该方法在不同场景下泛化能力强，能有效应对未知伪造挑战。

Conclusion: FGL和DPNet为深度伪造检测提供了鲁棒支持，代码已开源。

Abstract: The emergence of deepfake technology has introduced a range of societal
problems, garnering considerable attention. Current deepfake detection methods
perform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to
datasets with unknown forgery techniques. Moreover, as the gap between emerging
and traditional forgery techniques continues to widen, cross-domain detection
methods that rely on common forgery traces are becoming increasingly
ineffective. This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake
detection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative
forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided
Learning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously
adapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures
the differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques,
allowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To
further improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual
Perception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships
among forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically
perceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery
techniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then
integrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In
addition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the
entire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of
forgery trace correlations. Extensive experiments show that our approach
generalizes well across different scenarios and effectively handles unknown
forgery challenges, providing robust support for deepfake detection. Our code
is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/FGL.

*Youping Gu,Xiaolong Li,Yuhao Hu,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLADE提出了一种数据无关的联合训练框架，结合自适应块稀疏注意力机制和稀疏感知的步蒸馏范式，显著提升了视频生成模型的推理速度和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在高质量视频生成中表现优异，但其迭代去噪过程缓慢且长序列的二次注意力成本高昂，导致推理瓶颈。现有加速策略（步蒸馏和稀疏注意力）单独使用效果有限，联合训练又面临数据需求高的问题。

Method: BLADE框架包括：1）自适应块稀疏注意力机制（ASA），动态生成内容感知的稀疏掩码；2）基于轨迹分布匹配（TDM）的稀疏感知步蒸馏范式，将稀疏性直接融入蒸馏过程。

Result: 在CogVideoX-5B和Wan2.1-1.3B模型上，BLADE分别实现了8.89x和14.10x的推理加速，同时生成质量提升（VBench-2.0分数提高）。

Conclusion: BLADE通过创新的联合训练框架，解决了视频生成模型的推理瓶颈，显著提升了效率和生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video
generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive
quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference
bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have
shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining
these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration
yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after
step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To
overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint
training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention
(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to
focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware
step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)
that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than
treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate
BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework
demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On
Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a
50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video
sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the
acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the
VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from
0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further
corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/BLADE-Homepage/.

TL;DR: DARC是一种新型模型驱动的群组配准框架，用于高效构建医学图像图谱，支持多种图像相似性度量，并解决了GPU内存问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法依赖大数据集且泛化性差，而模型驱动方法虽数据高效但面临可扩展性挑战。DARC旨在提供一种灵活、通用的解决方案。

Method: DARC采用坐标下降策略和中心性激活函数，实现无偏、微分同胚的图谱构建。

Result: DARC在一次性分割和形状合成应用中表现优异，超越现有少样本方法。

Conclusion: DARC为图谱构建及其应用提供了高效、通用的框架。

Abstract: Atlas construction is fundamental to medical image analysis, offering a
standardized spatial reference for tasks such as population-level anatomical
modeling. While data-driven registration methods have recently shown promise in
pairwise settings, their reliance on large training datasets, limited
generalizability, and lack of true inference phases in groupwise contexts
hinder their practical use. In contrast, model-driven methods offer
training-free, theoretically grounded, and data-efficient alternatives, though
they often face scalability and optimization challenges when applied to large
3D datasets. In this work, we introduce DARC (Diffeomorphic Atlas Registration
via Coordinate descent), a novel model-driven groupwise registration framework
for atlas construction. DARC supports a broad range of image dissimilarity
metrics and efficiently handles arbitrary numbers of 3D images without
incurring GPU memory issues. Through a coordinate descent strategy and a
centrality-enforcing activation function, DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic
atlases with high anatomical fidelity. Beyond atlas construction, we
demonstrate two key applications: (1) One-shot segmentation, where labels
annotated only on the atlas are propagated to subjects via inverse
deformations, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot methods; and (2) shape
synthesis, where new anatomical variants are generated by warping the atlas
mesh using synthesized diffeomorphic deformation fields. Overall, DARC offers a
flexible, generalizable, and resource-efficient framework for atlas
construction and applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于ControlNet的RefSR方法难以有效对齐低分辨率图像与参考高分辨率图像的信息，且现有数据集分辨率低、质量差，无法支持高质量恢复。

Method: 提出TriFlowSR框架，设计参考匹配策略，并构建Landmark-4K数据集用于超高清地标场景。

Result: 实验表明，TriFlowSR能更有效地利用参考图像的语义和纹理信息。

Conclusion: TriFlowSR是首个针对真实世界退化的超高清地标场景的基于扩散的RefSR方法。

Abstract: Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) aims to restore a
low-resolution (LR) image by utilizing the semantic and texture information
from an additional reference high-resolution (reference HR) image. Existing
diffusion-based RefSR methods are typically built upon ControlNet, which
struggles to effectively align the information between the LR image and the
reference HR image. Moreover, current RefSR datasets suffer from limited
resolution and poor image quality, resulting in the reference images lacking
sufficient fine-grained details to support high-quality restoration. To
overcome the limitations above, we propose TriFlowSR, a novel framework that
explicitly achieves pattern matching between the LR image and the reference HR
image. Meanwhile, we introduce Landmark-4K, the first RefSR dataset for
Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) landmark scenarios. Considering the UHD scenarios
with real-world degradation, in TriFlowSR, we design a Reference Matching
Strategy to effectively match the LR image with the reference HR image.
Experimental results show that our approach can better utilize the semantic and
texture information of the reference HR image compared to previous methods. To
the best of our knowledge, we propose the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline
for ultra-high definition landmark scenarios under real-world degradation. Our
code and model will be available at https://github.com/nkicsl/TriFlowSR.

Motivation: 时空物理推理是理解真实物理世界的基础能力，但目前主流VLMs在此任务上的表现尚未充分探索，存在明显不足。

Method: 采用监督微调结合规则强化学习的方法，应用于Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型。

Result: 模型在时空物理推理任务上表现显著提升，超越了领先的专有模型，但泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 尽管方法取得了一定成功，但模型在新物理场景中的泛化能力仍然不足，亟需新的研究思路。

Abstract: Spatio-physical reasoning, a foundation capability for understanding the real
physics world, is a critical step towards building robust world models. While
recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding,
their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This
paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs,
revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task.
Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely
attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning.
To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by
rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant
improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading
proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's
generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the
pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.

Motivation: 现有被动活体检测方法易受攻击（如打印照片、屏幕显示等），需要更可靠的交互式方法。

Method: 用户按指令缓慢将面部靠近摄像头，结合光流分析和神经网络分类器提取时空特征。

Result: 该方法能有效区分真实面部与多种攻击（照片、屏幕、面具、视频重放），性能优于被动方法。

Conclusion: 交互式光流分析结合神经网络分类器为活体检测提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we proposed a novel cooperative video-based face liveness
detection method based on a new user interaction scenario where participants
are instructed to slowly move their frontal-oriented face closer to the camera.
This controlled approaching face protocol, combined with optical flow analysis,
represents the core innovation of our approach. By designing a system where
users follow this specific movement pattern, we enable robust extraction of
facial volume information through neural optical flow estimation, significantly
improving discrimination between genuine faces and various presentation attacks
(including printed photos, screen displays, masks, and video replays). Our
method processes both the predicted optical flows and RGB frames through a
neural classifier, effectively leveraging spatial-temporal features for more
reliable liveness detection compared to passive methods.

Motivation: 通过MRI准确区分脑肿瘤类型对治疗规划至关重要，研究探索了LLMs在视觉问答任务中的应用潜力。

Method: 使用BraTS数据集构建VQA基准，评估模型在零样本思维链设置下的表现。

Result: GPT-5-mini准确率最高（44.19%），但各模型在不同肿瘤亚型中表现不一，整体未达临床标准。

Conclusion: GPT-5系列模型在神经肿瘤VQA任务中表现中等，但尚不适合临床使用。

Abstract: Accurate differentiation of brain tumor types on magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is critical for guiding treatment planning in neuro-oncology. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled visual question answering
(VQA) approaches that integrate image interpretation with natural language
reasoning. In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and
GPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor
Segmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain
metastases (MET). Each case included multi-sequence MRI triplanar mosaics and
structured clinical features transformed into standardized VQA items. Models
were assessed in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy on both
visual and reasoning tasks. Results showed that GPT-5-mini achieved the highest
macro-average accuracy (44.19%), followed by GPT-5 (43.71%), GPT-4o (41.49%),
and GPT-5-nano (35.85%). Performance varied by tumor subtype, with no single
model dominating across all cohorts. These findings suggest that GPT-5 family
models can achieve moderate accuracy in structured neuro-oncological VQA tasks,
but not at a level acceptable for clinical use.

TL;DR: VasoMIM是一种针对X射线血管造影的自监督学习框架，通过整合血管解剖知识改进传统MIM的局限性，显著提升了血管分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线血管造影中血管分割的标注数据稀缺，传统MIM方法因血管与背景像素的类别不平衡导致血管表征能力不足。

Method: 提出VasoMIM框架，包含解剖引导的掩蔽策略和解剖一致性损失，优先掩蔽血管区域并强化血管语义一致性。

Result: 在三个数据集上达到最先进性能，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: VasoMIM为X射线血管造影分析提供了潜力巨大的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms is crucial for numerous
clinical applications. However, the scarcity of annotated data presents a
significant challenge, which has driven the adoption of self-supervised
learning (SSL) methods such as masked image modeling (MIM) to leverage
large-scale unlabeled data for learning transferable representations.
Unfortunately, conventional MIM often fails to capture vascular anatomy because
of the severe class imbalance between vessel and background pixels, leading to
weak vascular representations. To address this, we introduce Vascular
anatomy-aware Masked Image Modeling (VasoMIM), a novel MIM framework tailored
for X-ray angiograms that explicitly integrates anatomical knowledge into the
pre-training process. Specifically, it comprises two complementary components:
anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss. The former
preferentially masks vessel-containing patches to focus the model on
reconstructing vessel-relevant regions. The latter enforces consistency in
vascular semantics between the original and reconstructed images, thereby
improving the discriminability of vascular representations. Empirically,
VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets. These
findings highlight its potential to facilitate X-ray angiogram analysis.

Result: OF-Diff在关键质量指标上优于现有方法，特别是多态和小目标类别的性能提升显著，如飞机、船只和车辆的mAP分别提高了8.3%、7.7%和4.0%。

Conclusion: OF-Diff通过改进生成对象的保真度和多样性，为遥感图像生成提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: High-precision controllable remote sensing image generation is both
meaningful and challenging. Existing diffusion models often produce
low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological
details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection
models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote
sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which
effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are
the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for
diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion
model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote
sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase.
Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the
generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the
performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant
improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for
airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.

Conclusion: UI-Venus在UI任务中表现优异，贡献包括开源SOTA模型、数据清理协议和自进化框架，推动社区研究。

Abstract: We present UI-Venus, a native UI agent that takes only screenshots as input
based on a multimodal large language model. UI-Venus achieves SOTA performance
on both UI grounding and navigation tasks using only several hundred thousand
high-quality training samples through reinforcement finetune (RFT) based on

planing ability, we also evaluate it on the AndroidWorld, an online UI
navigation arena, on which our 7B and 72B variants achieve 49.1% and 65.9%
success rate, also beating existing models.To achieve this, we introduce
carefully designed reward functions for both UI grounding and navigation tasks
and corresponding efficient data cleaning strategies.To further boost
navigation performance, we propose Self-Evolving Trajectory History Alignment
\& Sparse Action Enhancement that refine historical reasoning traces and
balances the distribution of sparse but critical actions, leading to more
coherent planning and better generalization in complex UI tasks. Our
contributions include the publish of SOTA open-source UI agents, comprehensive

TL;DR: ToonComposer是一个生成模型，将动画制作的中间帧生成和上色阶段统一为一个后关键帧阶段，减少人工工作量并提高灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动画制作需要大量手动操作，现有AI方法分阶段处理导致错误累积和伪影。ToonComposer旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用稀疏草图注入机制和空间低秩适配器，将现代视频基础模型适配到卡通领域，支持稀疏输入和多草图控制。

Result: 在视觉质量、运动一致性和生产效率上优于现有方法，并通过PKBench验证。

Conclusion: ToonComposer为AI辅助卡通制作提供了更优且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional cartoon and anime production involves keyframing, inbetweening,
and colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent
advances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading
to error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches
struggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame
sketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that
unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.
ToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise
control using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation
method with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation
model to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring
as few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels
with sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal
location for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual
workload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.
To evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring
human-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation
demonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality,
motion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more
flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.

correspondences. To address this issue, we propose BaCon-Stereo, a simple yet
effective contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo network
training in both non-occluded and occluded regions. We adopt a teacher-student
paradigm with multi-baseline inputs, in which the stereo pairs fed into the
teacher and student share the same reference view but differ in target views.
Geometrically, regions occluded in the student's target view are often visible
in the teacher's, making it easier for the teacher to predict in these regions.
The teacher's prediction is rescaled to match the student's baseline and then
used to supervise the student. We also introduce an occlusion-aware attention
map to better guide the student in learning occlusion completion. To support
training, we synthesize a multi-baseline dataset BaCon-20k. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BaCon-Stereo improves prediction in both occluded
and non-occluded regions, achieves strong generalization and robustness, and
outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on both KITTI 2015 and
2012 benchmarks. Our code and dataset will be released upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: 论文提出AdaptFED，改进TransFed框架，通过任务感知客户端嵌入和低秩超网络条件优化，提升联邦学习的适应性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非独立同分布和跨域联邦学习中的个性化与泛化问题。

Method: 引入任务感知客户端嵌入和低秩超网络条件优化，改进焦点调制策略。

Result: 在八个数据集上验证了方法的优越性，特别是在源无关和跨任务联邦设置中。

Conclusion: AdaptFED扩展了焦点调制在联邦学习中的应用，为更自适应、可扩展的基于Transformer的联邦系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has proven essential for privacy-preserving,
collaborative training across distributed clients. Our prior work, TransFed,
introduced a robust transformer-based FL framework that leverages a
learn-to-adapt hypernetwork to generate personalized focal modulation layers
per client, outperforming traditional methods in non-IID and cross-domain
settings. In this extended version, we propose AdaptFED, where we deepen the
investigation of focal modulation in generalizable FL by incorporating: (1) a
refined adaptation strategy that integrates task-aware client embeddings to
personalize modulation dynamics further, (2) enhanced theoretical bounds on
adaptation performance, and (3) broader empirical validation across additional
modalities, including time-series and multilingual data. We also introduce an
efficient variant of TransFed that reduces server-client communication overhead
via low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, enabling scalable deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on eight diverse
datasets reaffirm the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art
baselines, particularly in source-free and cross-task federated setups. Our
findings not only extend the capabilities of focal modulation in FL but also
pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based
federated systems. The code is available at

*Harold Haodong Chen,Haojian Huang,Qifeng Chen,Harry Yang,Ser-Nam Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysHPO提出了一种分层跨模态直接偏好优化框架，通过四个层次的对齐提升视频生成的物理合理性和质量，并引入自动化数据选择流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频生成中物理合理性的挑战，提升真实感和准确性。

Method: 采用分层跨模态直接偏好优化（PhysHPO），从实例、状态、运动和语义四个层次对齐视频内容，并利用自动化数据选择流程。

Result: PhysHPO显著提升了视频生成的物理合理性和整体质量。

Conclusion: PhysHPO为更真实和符合人类偏好的视频生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the creation of
high-quality, visually compelling videos. However, generating videos that
adhere to the laws of physics remains a critical challenge for applications
requiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel
framework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to
tackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for
physically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across
four hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video
content with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency
using boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories
for realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency
between narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best
reflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data
selection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize "good data" from
existing large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for
costly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both
physics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO
significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation
quality of advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video
generation, paving the way for more realistic and human-preferred video
generation paradigms.

high-resolution geometry generation, creating high-resolution textures
end-to-end remains underexplored due to the lack of suitable datasets. TexVerse
fills this gap with a curated collection of over 858K unique high-resolution 3D
models sourced from Sketchfab, including more than 158K models with physically

skeleton and animation data uploaded by the user. We also provide detailed
model annotations describing overall characteristics, structural components,
and intricate features. TexVerse offers a high-quality data resource with
wide-ranging potential applications in texture synthesis, PBR material
development, animation, and various 3D vision and graphics tasks.

TL;DR: STream3R是一种基于Transformer的3D重建方法，通过流式处理和因果注意力机制，高效处理图像序列，并在静态和动态场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图重建方法依赖昂贵的全局优化或简单内存机制，难以适应长序列或动态场景。STream3R旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用解码器-only Transformer，结合因果注意力机制，从大规模3D数据中学习几何先验，实现流式处理。

Result: 在静态和动态场景基准测试中均优于现有方法，且兼容LLM式训练基础设施。

Conclusion: STream3R展示了因果Transformer模型在在线3D感知中的潜力，为实时3D理解提供了新方向。

Abstract: We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates
pointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing
state-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on
expensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that
scale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an
streaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal
attention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning
geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to
diverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional
methods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks.
Moreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training
infrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for
various downstream 3D tasks. Our results underscore the potential of causal
Transformer models for online 3D perception, paving the way for real-time 3D
understanding in streaming environments. More details can be found in our

Result: 在四个数据集上评估，MAESTRO在多时相任务中表现最佳，单时相任务中仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: MAESTRO为遥感数据的自监督学习提供了新的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds great promise for remote sensing, but standard
self-supervised methods must be adapted to the unique characteristics of Earth
observation data. We take a step in this direction by conducting a
comprehensive benchmark of fusion strategies and reconstruction target
normalization schemes for multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral Earth
observation data. Based on our findings, we propose MAESTRO, a novel adaptation
of the Masked Autoencoder, featuring optimized fusion strategies and a tailored
target normalization scheme that introduces a spectral prior as a
self-supervisory signal. Evaluated on four Earth observation datasets, MAESTRO
sets a new state-of-the-art on tasks that strongly rely on multitemporal
dynamics, while remaining highly competitive on tasks dominated by a single
mono-temporal modality. Code to reproduce all our experiments is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出ESSENTIAL方法，通过结合稀疏特征存储和语义提示，解决视频类增量学习中的记忆效率与性能权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频类增量学习方法在记忆效率和性能之间存在矛盾，稀疏存储牺牲了时间信息，而密集存储则内存效率低。

Method: ESSENTIAL结合稀疏特征的片段记忆和语义提示的语义记忆，通过跨注意力机制检索密集特征。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，ESSENTIAL在显著减少内存的同时表现优异。

Conclusion: ESSENTIAL有效平衡了记忆效率和性能，为视频类增量学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of video classincremental learning
(VCIL). Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by
rehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic
memory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store
temporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and
thereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between
memory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory
integrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL
consists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic
memory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We
introduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory
and semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of
temporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously
validate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and
Something-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and
Kinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced
memory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有跨领域模型依赖领域特定组件和多阶段训练，限制了实用性和扩展性。

Method: 提出Pose-in-Context (PiC)和Human-in-Context (HiC)方法，后者结合姿态和网格表示，扩展任务覆盖范围，并采用最大-最小相似性提示采样策略。

Result: HiC在泛化性、数据规模和性能上优于PiC，展示了统一跨领域模型的潜力。

Conclusion: HiC为构建灵活且可扩展的统一跨领域3D人体运动模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper aims to model 3D human motion across domains, where a single model
is expected to handle multiple modalities, tasks, and datasets. Existing
cross-domain models often rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage
training, which limits their practicality and scalability. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a new setting to train a unified cross-domain model
through a single process, eliminating the need for domain-specific components
and multi-stage training. We first introduce Pose-in-Context (PiC), which
leverages in-context learning to create a pose-centric cross-domain model.
While PiC generalizes across multiple pose-based tasks and datasets, it
encounters difficulties with modality diversity, prompting strategy, and
contextual dependency handling. We thus propose Human-in-Context (HiC), an
extension of PiC that broadens generalization across modalities, tasks, and
datasets. HiC combines pose and mesh representations within a unified
framework, expands task coverage, and incorporates larger-scale datasets.
Additionally, HiC introduces a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy to
enhance generalization across diverse domains and a network architecture with
dual-branch context injection for improved handling of contextual dependencies.
Extensive experimental results show that HiC performs better than PiC in terms
of generalization, data scale, and performance across a wide range of domains.
These results demonstrate the potential of HiC for building a unified
cross-domain 3D human motion model with improved flexibility and scalability.

Motivation: 解决QINRs在架构设计、量子力学属性利用及训练效率等方面的挑战，推动量子隐式神经表示的发展。

Method: 提出QVF，采用神经振幅编码和全纠缠可学习参数化量子电路，在实希尔伯特空间中实现稳定训练。

Result: QVF在量子硬件模拟器上表现优于现有量子方法和经典基线，尤其在视觉表示精度和高频细节学习方面。

Conclusion: QVF为量子视觉场学习提供了高效稳定的解决方案，展示了在2D和3D任务中的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Quantum Implicit Neural Representations (QINRs) include components for
learning and execution on gate-based quantum computers. While QINRs recently
emerged as a promising new paradigm, many challenges concerning their
architecture and ansatz design, the utility of quantum-mechanical properties,
training efficiency and the interplay with classical modules remain. This paper
advances the field by introducing a new type of QINR for 2D image and 3D
geometric field learning, which we collectively refer to as Quantum Visual
Field (QVF). QVF encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural
amplitude encoding grounded in a learnable energy manifold, ensuring meaningful
Hilbert space embeddings. Our ansatz follows a fully entangled design of
learnable parametrised quantum circuits, with quantum (unitary) operations
performed in the real Hilbert space, resulting in numerically stable training
with fast convergence. QVF does not rely on classical post-processing -- in
contrast to the previous QINR learning approach -- and directly employs
projective measurement to extract learned signals encoded in the ansatz.
Experiments on a quantum hardware simulator demonstrate that QVF outperforms
the existing quantum approach and widely used classical foundational baselines
in terms of visual representation accuracy across various metrics and model
characteristics, such as learning of high-frequency details. We also show
applications of QVF in 2D and 3D field completion and 3D shape interpolation,
highlighting its practical potential.

Abstract: Automating data extraction from clinical documents offers significant
potential to improve efficiency in healthcare settings, yet deploying Natural
Language Processing (NLP) solutions presents practical challenges. Drawing upon
our experience implementing various NLP models for information extraction and
classification tasks at the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), this paper
shares key lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle. We emphasize the
critical importance of defining problems based on clear business objectives
rather than solely technical accuracy, adopting an iterative approach to
development, and fostering deep interdisciplinary collaboration and co-design
involving domain experts, end-users, and ML specialists from inception. Further
insights highlight the need for pragmatic model selection (including hybrid
approaches and simpler methods where appropriate), rigorous attention to data
quality (representativeness, drift, annotation), robust error mitigation
strategies involving human-in-the-loop validation and ongoing audits, and
building organizational AI literacy. These practical considerations,
generalizable beyond cancer registries, provide guidance for healthcare
organizations seeking to successfully implement AI/NLP solutions to enhance
data management processes and ultimately improve patient care and public health
outcomes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in realworld
applications, yet concerns about their fairness persist especially in
highstakes domains like criminal justice, education, healthcare, and finance.
This paper introduces transparent evaluation protocol for benchmarking the
fairness of opensource LLMs using smart contracts on the Internet Computer
Protocol (ICP) blockchain (Foundation, 2023). Our method ensures verifiable,
immutable, and reproducible evaluations by executing onchain HTTP requests to
hosted Hugging Face endpoints and storing datasets, prompts, and metrics
directly onchain. We benchmark the Llama, DeepSeek, and Mistral models on the
PISA dataset for academic performance prediction (OECD, 2018), a dataset
suitable for fairness evaluation using statistical parity and equal opportunity
metrics (Hardt et al., 2016). We also evaluate structured Context Association
Metrics derived from the StereoSet dataset (Nadeem et al., 2020) to measure
social bias in contextual associations. We further extend our analysis with a
multilingual evaluation across English, Spanish, and Portuguese using the
Kaleidoscope benchmark (Salazar et al., 2025), revealing cross-linguistic
disparities. All code and results are open source, enabling community audits
and longitudinal fairness tracking across model versions.

Result: 发现传统计算方法表现不佳，而直接应用LLM能更好地实现分层主题结构。

Conclusion: 研究为教育中的GenAI应用提供了支持，但也提出了未来研究的关注点。

Abstract: We analyze anonymous interaction data of minors in class-rooms spanning
several months, schools, and subjects employing a novel, simple topic modeling
approach. Specifically, we categorize more than 17,000 messages generated by
students, teachers, and ChatGPT in two dimensions: content (such as nature and
people) and tasks (such as writing and explaining). Our hierarchical
categorization done separately for each dimension includes exemplary prompts,
and provides both a high-level overview as well as tangible insights. Prior
works mostly lack a content or thematic categorization. While task
categorizations are more prevalent in education, most have not been supported
by real-world data for K-12. In turn, it is not surprising that our analysis
yielded a number of novel applications. In deriving these insights, we found
that many of the well-established classical and emerging computational methods,
i.e., topic modeling, for analysis of large amounts of texts underperform,
leading us to directly apply state-of-the-art LLMs with adequate pre-processing
to achieve hierarchical topic structures with better human alignment through
explicit instructions than prior approaches. Our findings support fellow
researchers, teachers and students in enriching the usage of GenAI, while our
discussion also highlights a number of concerns and open questions for future
research.

Result: 所有模型更倾向于强化陪伴行为，但不同模型在敏感部分表现差异显著。

Conclusion: 需统一方法处理情感交互，平衡情感支持与边界设定以保障用户福祉。

Abstract: AI companionship, where users develop emotional bonds with AI systems, has
emerged as a significant pattern with positive but also concerning
implications. We introduce Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark
(INTIMA), a benchmark for evaluating companionship behaviors in language
models. Drawing from psychological theories and user data, we develop a
taxonomy of 31 behaviors across four categories and 368 targeted prompts.
Responses to these prompts are evaluated as companionship-reinforcing,
boundary-maintaining, or neutral. Applying INTIMA to Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini,
and Claude-4 reveals that companionship-reinforcing behaviors remain much more
common across all models, though we observe marked differences between models.
Different commercial providers prioritize different categories within the more
sensitive parts of the benchmark, which is concerning since both appropriate
boundary-setting and emotional support matter for user well-being. These
findings highlight the need for more consistent approaches to handling
emotionally charged interactions.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media calls for more
effective and robust detection methods. Recent advances leveraging multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown the potential in addressing this
challenge. However, it remains unclear exactly where the bottleneck of existing
approaches lies (evidence retrieval v.s. reasoning), hindering the further
advances in this field. On the dataset side, existing benchmarks either contain
outdated events, leading to evaluation bias due to discrepancies with
contemporary social media scenarios as MLLMs can simply memorize these events,
or artificially synthetic, failing to reflect real-world misinformation
patterns. Additionally, it lacks comprehensive analyses of MLLM-based model
design strategies. To address these issues, we introduce XFacta, a
contemporary, real-world dataset that is better suited for evaluating
MLLM-based detectors. We systematically evaluate various MLLM-based
misinformation detection strategies, assessing models across different
architectures and scales, as well as benchmarking against existing detection
methods. Building on these analyses, we further enable a semi-automatic
detection-in-the-loop framework that continuously updates XFacta with new
content to maintain its contemporary relevance. Our analysis provides valuable
insights and practices for advancing the field of multimodal misinformation
detection. The code and data have been released.

Abstract: When developing text classification models for real world applications, one
major challenge is the difficulty to collect sufficient data for all text
classes. In this work, we address this challenge by utilizing large language
models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data and using such data to improve the
performance of the models without waiting for more real data to be collected
and labelled. As an LLM generates different synthetic data in response to
different input examples, we formulate an automated workflow, which searches
for input examples that lead to more ``effective'' synthetic data for improving
the model concerned. We study three search strategies with an extensive set of
experiments, and use experiment results to inform an ensemble algorithm that
selects a search strategy according to the characteristics of a class. Our
further experiments demonstrate that this ensemble approach is more effective
than each individual strategy in our automated workflow for improving
classification models using LLMs.

fact-verification systems largely focus on high-resource, monolingual settings
and fail to generalize to real-world political discourse in linguistically
diverse regions like India. Given the widespread use of Hinglish by public
figures, particularly political figures, and the growing influence of social
media on public opinion, there's a critical need for robust, multilingual and
context-aware fact-checking tools. To address this gap a novel benchmark HiFACT
dataset is introduced with 1,500 realworld factual claims made by 28 Indian
state Chief Ministers in Hinglish, under a highly code-mixed low-resource
setting. Each claim is annotated with textual evidence and veracity labels. To
evaluate this benchmark, a novel graphaware, retrieval-augmented fact-checking
model is proposed that combines multilingual contextual encoding,
claim-evidence semantic alignment, evidence graph construction, graph neural
reasoning, and natural language explanation generation. Experimental results
show that HiFACTMix outperformed accuracy in comparison to state of art
multilingual baselines models and provides faithful justifications for its
verdicts. This work opens a new direction for multilingual, code-mixed, and
politically grounded fact verification research.

### [115] [Semantic Structure in Large Language Model Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10003)
*Austin C. Kozlowski,Callin Dai,Andrei Boutyline*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLM）的嵌入矩阵中的语义关联与人类评分的低维结构相似，且语义特征在LLM中与人类语言中的纠缠方式类似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM中语义关联的结构是否与人类语言中的低维语义结构相似。

Method: 通过定义反义词对（如kind-cruel）的语义方向，分析LLM嵌入矩阵中单词的投影与人类评分的相关性，并研究其低维子空间结构。

Result: LLM中的语义投影与人类评分高度相关，且可简化为3维子空间；语义特征的纠缠方式与人类语言相似。

Conclusion: LLM中的语义信息具有低维性，理解其结构对避免特征引导时的意外后果至关重要。

Abstract: Psychological research consistently finds that human ratings of words across
diverse semantic scales can be reduced to a low-dimensional form with
relatively little information loss. We find that the semantic associations
encoded in the embedding matrices of large language models (LLMs) exhibit a
similar structure. We show that the projections of words on semantic directions
defined by antonym pairs (e.g. kind - cruel) correlate highly with human
ratings, and further find that these projections effectively reduce to a
3-dimensional subspace within LLM embeddings, closely resembling the patterns
derived from human survey responses. Moreover, we find that shifting tokens
along one semantic direction causes off-target effects on geometrically aligned
features proportional to their cosine similarity. These findings suggest that
semantic features are entangled within LLMs similarly to how they are
interconnected in human language, and a great deal of semantic information,
despite its apparent complexity, is surprisingly low-dimensional. Furthermore,
accounting for this semantic structure may prove essential for avoiding
unintended consequences when steering features.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨注意力权重在生物医学文档分类中作为解释工具的实用性，发现其效果取决于可视化方式，而非权重本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索注意力权重是否能为生物医学文档分类提供有用的解释，并研究可视化方式对其效果的影响。

Method: 通过用户研究，让医学专家使用不同可视化方式（如文本亮度、背景颜色）评估注意力权重的解释效果。

Result: XLNet模型分类准确，但注意力权重解释效果有限，可视化方式显著影响用户感知。

Conclusion: 注意力权重的解释效果受可视化方式影响，需进一步优化以提高实用性。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Beyond improving performance, attention has been proposed as a mechanism for
explainability via attention weights, which are associated with input features
(e.g., tokens in a document). In this context, larger attention weights may
imply more relevant features for the model's prediction. In evidence-based
medicine, such explanations could support physicians' understanding and
interaction with AI systems used to categorize biomedical literature. However,
there is still no consensus on whether attention weights provide helpful
explanations. Moreover, little research has explored how visualizing attention
affects its usefulness as an explanation aid. To bridge this gap, we conducted
a user study to evaluate whether attention-based explanations support users in
biomedical document classification and whether there is a preferred way to
visualize them. The study involved medical experts from various disciplines who
classified articles based on study design (e.g., systematic reviews, broad
synthesis, randomized and non-randomized trials). Our findings show that the
Transformer model (XLNet) classified documents accurately; however, the
attention weights were not perceived as particularly helpful for explaining the
predictions. However, this perception varied significantly depending on how
attention was visualized. Contrary to Munzner's principle of visual
effectiveness, which favors precise encodings like bar length, users preferred
more intuitive formats, such as text brightness or background color. While our
results do not confirm the overall utility of attention weights for
explanation, they suggest that their perceived helpfulness is influenced by how
they are visually presented.

TL;DR: 论文提出EQGBench，一个用于评估大语言模型在中文教育问题生成（EQG）中表现的基准，揭示了模型在教育价值问题生成上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在数学解题方面表现优异，但在生成高质量教育问题方面仍存在挑战，需要进一步探索。

Method: 引入EQGBench基准，包含900个评估样本，覆盖数学、物理和化学三个学科，采用五维评估框架。

Result: 对46个主流大模型的评估显示，其在生成具有教育价值的问题方面仍有显著提升空间。

Conclusion: EQGBench为提升大语言模型在教育问题生成中的表现提供了重要工具和方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
mathematical problem-solving. However, the transition from providing answers to
generating high-quality educational questions presents significant challenges
that remain underexplored. To advance Educational Question Generation (EQG) and
facilitate LLMs in generating pedagogically valuable and educationally
effective questions, we introduce EQGBench, a comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating LLMs' performance in Chinese EQG. EQGBench
establishes a five-dimensional evaluation framework supported by a dataset of
900 evaluation samples spanning three fundamental middle school disciplines:
mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The dataset incorporates user queries with
varying knowledge points, difficulty gradients, and question type
specifications to simulate realistic educational scenarios. Through systematic
evaluation of 46 mainstream large models, we reveal significant room for
development in generating questions that reflect educational value and foster
students' comprehensive abilities.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了使用大型语言模型自动评分AIHQ开放式问题的可行性，结果显示模型评分与人工评分一致，且能推广到非临床数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIHQ开放式问题评分耗时，需人工完成，研究旨在探索大型语言模型能否自动化这一过程。

Method: 使用已收集的数据集，对模型进行微调后测试其评分与人工评分的一致性，并验证模型在不同场景和人群中的表现。

Result: 模型评分与人工评分高度一致，微调后效果更佳，且能复现TBI与HC组的差异。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型可有效自动化AIHQ评分，适用于研究和临床场景。

Abstract: Hostile attribution bias is the tendency to interpret social interactions as
intentionally hostile. The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ)
is commonly used to measure hostile attribution bias, and includes open-ended
questions where participants describe the perceived intentions behind a
negative social situation and how they would respond. While these questions
provide insights into the contents of hostile attributions, they require
time-intensive scoring by human raters. In this study, we assessed whether
large language models can automate the scoring of AIHQ open-ended responses. We
used a previously collected dataset in which individuals with traumatic brain
injury (TBI) and healthy controls (HC) completed the AIHQ and had their
open-ended responses rated by trained human raters. We used half of these
responses to fine-tune the two models on human-generated ratings, and tested
the fine-tuned models on the remaining half of AIHQ responses. Results showed
that model-generated ratings aligned with human ratings for both attributions
of hostility and aggression responses, with fine-tuned models showing higher
alignment. This alignment was consistent across ambiguous, intentional, and
accidental scenario types, and replicated previous findings on group
differences in attributions of hostility and aggression responses between TBI
and HC groups. The fine-tuned models also generalized well to an independent
nonclinical dataset. To support broader adoption, we provide an accessible
scoring interface that includes both local and cloud-based options. Together,
our findings suggest that large language models can streamline AIHQ scoring in
both research and clinical contexts, revealing their potential to facilitate
psychological assessments across different populations.

Motivation: 在线课程讨论论坛的自动管理需要频繁更新，导致LLM的微调成本高昂，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出贝叶斯融合方法，结合预训练通用LLM和本地数据分类器的分类分数。

Result: 融合方法的性能优于单独使用任一分类器，且与微调LLM的方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯融合是一种高效且性能优越的替代方案，避免了昂贵的LLM微调。

Abstract: The automatic curation of discussion forums in online courses requires
constant updates, making frequent retraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) a
resource-intensive process. To circumvent the need for costly fine-tuning, this
paper proposes and evaluates the use of Bayesian fusion. The approach combines
the multidimensional classification scores of a pre-trained generic LLM with
those of a classifier trained on local data. The performance comparison
demonstrated that the proposed fusion improves the results compared to each
classifier individually, and is competitive with the LLM fine-tuning approach

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬参数共享在多任务学习中常导致任务干扰，影响模型性能，需一种更优的解决方案。

Method: S-MoE利用引导令牌直接分配任务至特定专家，无需训练门控函数，每个任务使用独立的网络。

Result: 在语音转文本任务中，S-MoE显著提升了性能，词错误率相对降低6.35%。

Conclusion: S-MoE是一种简单有效的多任务学习方法，能显著减少任务干扰并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Hard-parameter sharing is a common strategy to train a single model jointly
across diverse tasks. However, this often leads to task interference, impeding
overall model performance. To address the issue, we propose a simple yet
effective Supervised Mixture of Experts (S-MoE). Unlike traditional Mixture of
Experts models, S-MoE eliminates the need for training gating functions by
utilizing special guiding tokens to route each task to its designated expert.
By assigning each task to a separate feedforward network, S-MoE overcomes the
limitations of hard-parameter sharing. We further apply S-MoE to a
speech-to-text model, enabling the model to process mixed-bandwidth input while
jointly performing automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation
(ST). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed S-MoE,
achieving a 6.35% relative improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) when applied to
both the encoder and decoder.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成有害医疗错误信息方面的能力，以及如何利用LLMs检测和预防此类信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs可能被滥用生成错误信息，但也可能用于检测和阻止错误信息的传播。

Method: 分析了109种针对三种目标LLMs的攻击，比较了攻击提示与真实健康相关查询，并评估了生成的错误信息与Reddit上的错误信息的差异。

Result: LLMs能有效检测来自其他LLMs和人类的错误信息，支持其在健康信息生态系统中的积极作用。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计，LLMs可以促进更健康的信息生态系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are a double-edged sword capable of generating
harmful misinformation -- inadvertently, or when prompted by "jailbreak"
attacks that attempt to produce malicious outputs. LLMs could, with additional
research, be used to detect and prevent the spread of misinformation. In this
paper, we investigate the efficacy and characteristics of LLM-produced
jailbreak attacks that cause other models to produce harmful medical
misinformation. We also study how misinformation generated by jailbroken LLMs
compares to typical misinformation found on social media, and how effectively
it can be detected using standard machine learning approaches. Specifically, we
closely examine 109 distinct attacks against three target LLMs and compare the
attack prompts to in-the-wild health-related LLM queries. We also examine the
resulting jailbreak responses, comparing the generated misinformation to
health-related misinformation on Reddit. Our findings add more evidence that
LLMs can be effectively used to detect misinformation from both other LLMs and
from people, and support a body of work suggesting that with careful design,
LLMs can contribute to a healthier overall information ecosystem.

Motivation: 探索生成式AI在营养教育领域的潜力，尤其是作为营养学学生的学习辅助工具。

Method: 使用日本注册营养师国家考试题目测试ChatGPT和三种Bing模型的准确性、一致性和响应时间，并尝试提示工程改进性能。

Result: Bing-Precise（66.2%）和Bing-Creative（61.4%）超过及格线（60%），但其他模型表现不佳；所有模型在答案一致性上存在问题。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在营养师考试辅助中表现有限，需进一步改进以提高可靠性和稳定性。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) based on large language models
(LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has demonstrated remarkable progress across various
professional fields, including medicine and education. However, their
performance in nutritional education, especially in Japanese national licensure
examination for registered dietitians, remains underexplored. This study aimed
to evaluate the potential of current LLM-based generative AI models as study
aids for nutrition students. Questions from the Japanese national examination
for registered dietitians were used as prompts for ChatGPT and three Bing
models (Precise, Creative, Balanced), based on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Each question
was entered into independent sessions, and model responses were analyzed for
accuracy, consistency, and response time. Additional prompt engineering,
including role assignment, was tested to assess potential performance
improvements. Bing-Precise (66.2%) and Bing-Creative (61.4%) surpassed the
passing threshold (60%), while Bing-Balanced (43.3%) and ChatGPT (42.8%) did
not. Bing-Precise and Bing-Creative generally outperformed others across
subject fields except Nutrition Education, where all models underperformed.
None of the models consistently provided the same correct responses across
repeated attempts, highlighting limitations in answer stability. ChatGPT showed
greater consistency in response patterns but lower accuracy. Prompt engineering
had minimal effect, except for modest improvement when correct answers and
explanations were explicitly provided. While some generative AI models
marginally exceeded the passing threshold, overall accuracy and answer
consistency remained suboptimal. Moreover, all the models demonstrated notable
limitations in answer consistency and robustness. Further advancements are
needed to ensure reliable and stable AI-based study aids for dietitian
licensure preparation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs依赖静态知识和不透明的推理过程，限制了其在知识密集型任务中的表现；现有知识图谱探索方法存在粒度不匹配或上下文利用不足的问题。

Method: 提出GG Explore框架，引入Guidance Graph作为中间层，结合结构对齐和上下文感知剪枝技术。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在复杂任务中效率更高，性能优于现有技术，且适用于较小的LLMs。

Conclusion: GG Explore通过Guidance Graph有效解决了知识探索中的问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong linguistic capabilities,
their reliance on static knowledge and opaque reasoning processes limits their
performance in knowledge intensive tasks. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a
promising solution, but current exploration methods face a fundamental trade
off: question guided approaches incur redundant exploration due to granularity
mismatches, while clue guided methods fail to effectively leverage contextual
information for complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose
Guidance Graph guided Knowledge Exploration (GG Explore), a novel framework
that introduces an intermediate Guidance Graph to bridge unstructured queries
and structured knowledge retrieval. The Guidance Graph defines the retrieval
space by abstracting the target knowledge' s structure while preserving broader
semantic context, enabling precise and efficient exploration. Building upon the
Guidance Graph, we develop: (1) Structural Alignment that filters incompatible
candidates without LLM overhead, and (2) Context Aware Pruning that enforces
semantic consistency with graph constraints. Extensive experiments show our
method achieves superior efficiency and outperforms SOTA, especially on complex
tasks, while maintaining strong performance with smaller LLMs, demonstrating
practical value.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“Semantic Bridge”的通用框架，用于从任意来源可控地生成复杂的多跳推理问题，解决了高质量推理问答对稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLM）训练面临高质量、推理密集型问答对稀缺的瓶颈，尤其是在特定领域（如PubMed论文或法律文件）中。现有方法无法生成可控的复杂多跳推理问题。

Method: 提出“语义图编织”技术，包括三种互补的桥接机制（实体桥接、谓词链桥接和因果桥接），通过AMR驱动的分析系统构建复杂路径。

Result: 在多语言（英语、中文、法语、德语）和通用及专业领域（如生物医学）的评估中，性能显著优于基线方法，生成的问题对质量甚至超过人工标注。

Conclusion: Semantic Bridge为LLM训练数据合成提供了新范式，能够从稀疏来源可控生成目标推理问题。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) training faces a critical bottleneck: the scarcity
of high-quality, reasoning-intensive question-answer pairs, especially from
sparse, domain-specific sources like PubMed papers or legal documents. Existing
methods rely on surface patterns, fundamentally failing to generate
controllable, complex multi-hop reasoning questions that test genuine
understanding-essential for advancing LLM training paradigms. We present
\textbf{Semantic Bridge}, the first universal framework for controllably
generating sophisticated multi-hop reasoning questions from arbitrary sources.
Our breakthrough innovation is \textit{semantic graph weaving}-three
complementary bridging mechanisms (entity bridging for role-varying shared
entities, predicate chain bridging for temporal/causal/logical sequences, and
causal bridging for explicit reasoning chains)-that systematically construct
complex pathways across documents, with fine-grained control over complexity
and types via AMR-driven analysis. Our multi-modal AMR pipeline achieves up to
9.5% better round-trip quality, enabling production-ready controllable QA
generation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates performance across both
general-purpose datasets (Wikipedia) and specialized domains (biomedicine) It
yields consistent 18.3%-25.4% gains over baselines across four languages
(English, Chinese, French, German). Question pairs generated from 200 sources
outperform 600 native human annotation examples with 67% fewer materials. Human
evaluation shows 23.4% higher complexity, 18.7% better answerability, and 31.2%
improved pattern coverage. Semantic Bridge establishes a new paradigm for LLM
training data synthesis, enabling controllable generation of targeted reasoning
questions from sparse sources. We will release our core code and semantic
bridge model.

Motivation: 现有角色扮演研究依赖未验证的LLM评估范式，可能无法反映人类对角色忠诚度的感知，需先解决角色识别问题。

Method: 提出PersonaEval基准，使用人类撰写的小说、剧本和视频对话，测试LLM在对话上下文中识别角色的能力。

Result: 最佳LLM准确率仅69%，远低于人类的90.8%，表明LLM评估器在角色扮演场景中不可靠。

Conclusion: 可靠评估需LLM具备类人推理能力，仅任务特定调优不足。PersonaEval基准已开源。

Abstract: Current role-play studies often rely on unvalidated LLM-as-a-judge paradigms,
which may fail to reflect how humans perceive role fidelity. A key prerequisite
for human-aligned evaluation is role identification, the ability to recognize
who is speaking based on dialogue context. We argue that any meaningful
judgment of role-playing quality (how well a character is played) fundamentally
depends on first correctly attributing words and actions to the correct persona
(who is speaking). We present PersonaEval, the first benchmark designed to test
whether LLM evaluators can reliably identify human roles. PersonaEval uses
human-authored dialogues from novels, scripts, and video transcripts,
challenging models to determine the correct persona according to the
conversation context. Our experiments, including a human study, show that even
the best-performing LLMs reach only around 69% accuracy, well below the level
needed for reliable evaluation. In contrast, human participants perform near
ceiling with 90.8% accuracy, highlighting that current LLM evaluators are still
not human enough to effectively judge role-play scenarios. To better understand
this gap, we examine training-time adaptation and test-time compute, suggesting
that reliable evaluation requires more than task-specific tuning, but depends
on strong, human-like reasoning abilities in LLM evaluators. We release our
benchmark at https://github.com/maple-zhou/PersonaEval.

Conclusion: RealTalk-CN填补了中文语音任务导向对话数据集的空白，支持语音不流畅性和说话者多样性的研究。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
advancements in multimodal processing, including end-to-end speech-based
language models that enable natural interactions and perform specific tasks in
task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. However, existing TOD datasets are
predominantly text-based, lacking real speech signals that are essential for
evaluating the robustness of speech-based LLMs. Moreover, existing speech TOD
datasets are primarily English and lack critical aspects such as speech
disfluencies and speaker variations. To address these gaps, we introduce
RealTalk-CN, the first Chinese multi-turn, multi-domain speech-text dual-modal
TOD dataset, comprising 5.4k dialogues (60K utterances, 150 hours) with paired
speech-text annotations. RealTalk-CN captures diverse dialogue scenarios with
annotated spontaneous speech disfluencies, ensuring comprehensive coverage of
real-world complexities in speech dialogue. In addition, we propose a novel
cross-modal chat task that authentically simulates real-world user
interactions, allowing dynamic switching between speech and text modalities.
Our evaluation covers robustness to speech disfluencies, sensitivity to speaker
characteristics, and cross-domain performance. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of RealTalk-CN, establishing a strong foundation for Chinese
speech-based LLMs research.

Result: 性能提升7.8%，延迟降低10.3%，并增强了解释性。

Conclusion: MLLM Orchestration提供了一种高效、可解释的多模态交互解决方案，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Different Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) cannot be integrated into
a unified multimodal input-output system directly. In previous work, training
has been considered as an inevitable component due to challenges in modal
alignment, Text-to-Speech efficiency and other integration issues. In this
paper, we introduce Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration, an effective
approach for creating interactive multimodal AI systems without additional
training. MLLM Orchestration leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of
large language models to coordinate specialized models through explicit
workflows, enabling natural multimodal interactions while maintaining
modularity, improving interpretability, and significantly enhancing
computational efficiency. Our orchestration framework is built upon three key
innovations: (1) a central controller LLM that analyzes user inputs and
dynamically routes tasks to appropriate specialized models through carefully
designed agents; (2) a parallel Text-to-Speech architecture that enables true
full-duplex interaction with seamless interruption handling and natural
conversational flow; and (3) a cross-modal memory integration system that
maintains coherent context across modalities through intelligent information
synthesis and retrieval, selectively avoiding unnecessary modality calls in
certain scenarios to improve response speed. Extensive evaluations demonstrate
that MLLM Orchestration achieves comprehensive multimodal capabilities without
additional training, performance improvements of up to 7.8% over traditional
jointly-trained approaches on standard benchmarks, reduced latency by 10.3%,
and significantly enhanced interpretability through explicit orchestration
processes.

Result: 通过范畴同伦技术，成功构建了一种能够处理语言中语义等价但形式不同表达的框架。

Conclusion: 本文提出的范畴同伦框架为解决LLMs中的语义等价问题提供了理论基础，并展示了其潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Natural language is replete with superficially different statements, such as
``Charles Darwin wrote" and ``Charles Darwin is the author of", which carry the
same meaning. Large language models (LLMs) should generate the same next-token
probabilities in such cases, but usually do not. Empirical workarounds have
been explored, such as using k-NN estimates of sentence similarity to produce
smoothed estimates. In this paper, we tackle this problem more abstractly,
introducing a categorical homotopy framework for LLMs. We introduce an LLM
Markov category to represent probability distributions in language generated by
an LLM, where the probability of a sentence, such as ``Charles Darwin wrote" is
defined by an arrow in a Markov category. However, this approach runs into
difficulties as language is full of equivalent rephrases, and each generates a
non-isomorphic arrow in the LLM Markov category. To address this fundamental
problem, we use categorical homotopy techniques to capture ``weak equivalences"
in an LLM Markov category. We present a detailed overview of application of
categorical homotopy to LLMs, from higher algebraic K-theory to model
categories, building on powerful theoretical results developed over the past
half a century.

*Li Wang,Changhao Zhang,Zengqi Xiu,Kai Lu,Xin Yu,Kui Zhang,Wenjun Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出DURIT框架，通过将自然语言问题映射到规范问题空间，分离理解与推理，提升小语言模型（SLMs）的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型（SLMs）在复杂多变的自然语言中难以提取核心问题并进行推理，限制了其性能。

Method: 提出DURIT框架，通过三步算法（问题映射、自蒸馏对齐推理轨迹、问题空间训练）分离理解与推理。

Result: DURIT显著提升了SLMs在数学和逻辑推理任务中的性能及鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 分离理解与推理是提升SLMs推理能力的有效策略。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), improving the reasoning ability of Small Language Models (SLMs,
e.g., $\leq$ 1.5B) remains challenging. A key obstacle lies in the complexity
and variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often
appear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting
details. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core
problem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that
understanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,
particularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a
new framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural
language problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet
expressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized
inputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce
DURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a
three-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems
via reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through
self-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The
mapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this
process. Experiments show that DURIT substantially improves SLMs' performance
on both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks.
Beyond improving reasoning capabilities, DURIT also improves the robustness of
reasoning, validating decoupling understanding from reasoning as an effective
strategy for strengthening SLMs.

*Chuan Li,Qianyi Zhao,Fengran Mo,Cen Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FedCoT是一种新颖的联邦学习框架，旨在提升大型语言模型在医疗等领域的推理能力，同时满足计算、通信和隐私约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦学习环境中，现有方法难以平衡推理性能与隐私、计算和通信开销，尤其是在医疗领域需要可解释的推理路径。

Method: FedCoT通过本地生成多推理路径并动态选择最优路径，结合改进的LoRA模块聚合方法，提升推理准确性和鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，FedCoT在医疗推理任务中显著提升性能，同时完全保护数据隐私。

Conclusion: FedCoT为联邦学习中的高效推理提供了可行方案，特别适用于医疗等对隐私和解释性要求高的领域。

Abstract: Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in federated learning environments remains challenging, particularly
when balancing performance gains with strict computational, communication, and
privacy constraints. This challenge is especially acute in healthcare, where
decisions-spanning clinical, operational, and patient-facing contexts-demand
not only accurate outputs but also interpretable, traceable rationales to
ensure safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. Conventional
federated tuning approaches on LLM fail to address this need: they optimize
primarily for answer correctness while neglecting rationale quality, leaving
CoT capabilities dependent on models' innate pre-training abilities. Moreover,
existing methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating
knowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication
overhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial. We
addresses this gap by proposing FedCoT, a novel framework specifically designed
to enhance reasoning in federated settings. FedCoT leverages a lightweight
chain-of-thought enhancement mechanism: local models generate multiple
reasoning paths, and a compact discriminator dynamically selects the most
promising one. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and robustness while
providing valuable interpretability, which is particularly critical for medical
applications. To manage client heterogeneity efficiently, we adopt an improved
aggregation approach building upon advanced LoRA module stacking, incorporating
client classifier-awareness to achieve noise-free aggregation across diverse
clients. Comprehensive experiments on medical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
FedCoT significantly boosts client-side reasoning performance under stringent
resource budgets while fully preserving data privacy.

Motivation: 金融应用中，从客户历史通信序列学习嵌入是关键，但直接使用LLM处理长序列计算成本高且不实用。

Method: 提出LATTE框架，利用冻结LLM生成语义嵌入，通过对比学习对齐原始事件嵌入，将行为特征总结为短提示。

Result: 实验表明，LATTE在真实金融数据集上优于现有技术，且适用于延迟敏感环境。

Conclusion: LATTE是一种高效且实用的方法，显著降低了LLM的计算负担，同时提升了性能。

Abstract: Learning clients embeddings from sequences of their historic communications
is central to financial applications. While large language models (LLMs) offer
general world knowledge, their direct use on long event sequences is
computationally expensive and impractical in real-world pipelines. In this
paper, we propose LATTE, a contrastive learning framework that aligns raw event
embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs. Behavioral features are
summarized into short prompts, embedded by the LLM, and used as supervision via
contrastive loss. The proposed approach significantly reduces inference cost
and input size compared to conventional processing of complete sequence by LLM.
We experimentally show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
for learning event sequence representations on real-world financial datasets
while remaining deployable in latency-sensitive environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在学科问答中存在幻觉和非事实生成问题，影响回答可靠性，而共形预测和显著性测试的结合尚未被探索。

Method: 通过自一致性重采样计算选项频率，结合p值和零假设检验构建预测集。

Result: 在MMLU和MMLU-Pro基准测试中，增强的共形预测实现了用户指定的错误覆盖率，且预测集大小随风险水平单调递减。

Conclusion: 该研究为高风险问答应用中的可信大语言模型部署提供了统计框架。

Abstract: This study introduces a significance testing-enhanced conformal prediction
(CP) framework to improve trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). While LLMs have been increasingly
deployed in disciplinary QA scenarios, hallucination and nonfactual generation
substantially compromise response reliability. Although CP provides
statistically rigorous marginal coverage guarantees for prediction sets, and
significance testing offers established statistical rigor, their synergistic
integration remains unexplored. To mitigate hallucination and factual
inaccuracies, our framework integrates $p$-value computation with conformity
scoring through self-consistency resampling of MCQA responses. This approach
calculates option frequencies to address LLMs' black-box nature, subsequently
constructing prediction sets via null hypothesis testing ($\mathcal{H}_0$) with
empirically derived $p$-values. Evaluations on MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks
using off-the-shelf LLMs demonstrate: (1) The enhanced CP achieves
user-specified empirical miscoverage rates; (2) Test-set average prediction set
size (APSS) decreases monotonically with increasing risk levels ($\alpha$),
validating APSS as an effective uncertainty metric. This work establishes a
principled statistical framework for trustworthy LLM deployment in high-stakes
QA applications.

TL;DR: RTTC框架通过奖励模型自适应选择最佳TTC策略，结合分布式架构和缓存机制，显著提升LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTC策略在不同查询中效果不一，盲目应用会导致计算开销过大，需自适应选择最优策略。

Method: 提出RTTC框架，利用预训练奖励模型动态选择TTC策略，结合分布式架构和查询状态缓存减少冗余计算。

Result: 实验表明RTTC在多种LLM和任务中优于传统RAG或TTT，验证了自适应策略的必要性。

Conclusion: RTTC展示了自适应TTC策略的潜力，为高性能语言模型适配提供了可扩展方案。

Abstract: Test-Time Compute (TTC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) at inference, leveraging strategies
such as Test-Time Training (TTT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
However, the optimal adaptation strategy varies across queries, and
indiscriminate application of TTC strategy incurs substantial computational
overhead. In this work, we introduce Reward-Guided Test-Time Compute (RTTC), a
novel framework that adaptively selects the most effective TTC strategy for
each query via a pretrained reward model, maximizing downstream accuracy across
diverse domains and tasks. RTTC operates in a distributed server-client
architecture, retrieving relevant samples from a remote knowledge base and
applying RAG or lightweight fine-tuning on client devices only when necessary.
To further mitigate redundant computation, we propose Query-State Caching,
which enables the efficient reuse of historical query states at both retrieval
and adaptation levels. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and
benchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy
compared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive,
reward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable,
high-performance language model adaptation.

Conclusion: 该解决方案有助于快速检测产后抑郁及其风险因素，为及时干预提供了支持。

Abstract: Among the many challenges mothers undergo after childbirth, postpartum
depression (PPD) is a severe condition that significantly impacts their mental
and physical well-being. Consequently, the rapid detection of ppd and their
associated risk factors is critical for in-time assessment and intervention
through specialized prevention procedures. Accordingly, this work addresses the
need to help practitioners make decisions with the latest technological
advancements to enable real-time screening and treatment recommendations.
Mainly, our work contributes to an intelligent PPD screening system that
combines Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language
Models (LLMs) towards an affordable, real-time, and non-invasive free speech
analysis. Moreover, it addresses the black box problem since the predictions
are described to the end users thanks to the combination of LLMs with
interpretable ml models (i.e., tree-based algorithms) using feature importance
and natural language. The results obtained are 90 % on ppd detection for all
evaluation metrics, outperforming the competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our solution contributes to the rapid detection of PPD and their
associated risk factors, critical for in-time and proper assessment and
intervention.

TL;DR: SABER是一个强化学习框架，通过用户可控的推理预算优化LLM的效率，支持四种推理模式，显著减少推理成本并保持高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在复杂任务上表现优异，但推理成本和延迟较高，需要一种灵活且高效的解决方案。

Method: SABER通过预算分层训练、系统提示和长度感知奖励，结合无推理示例，实现可控推理。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和逻辑推理任务中，SABER在严格预算下保持高准确性，推理长度减少65.4%，准确率提升3.6%。

Conclusion: SABER提供了一种高效且灵活的LLM推理方法，显著优化了性能和成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) empowered by chain-of-thought reasoning have
achieved impressive accuracy on complex tasks but suffer from excessive
inference costs and latency when applied uniformly to all problems. We propose
SABER (Switchable and Balanced Training for Efficient LLM Reasoning), a
reinforcement learning framework that endows LLMs with user-controllable,
token-budgeted reasoning. SABER first profiles each training example's
base-model thinking token usage and assigns it to one of the predefined budget
tiers. During fine-tuning, the model is guided by system prompts and
length-aware rewards to respect its assigned budget. In parallel, we
incorporate no-think examples to ensure the model remains reliable even when
explicit reasoning is turned off. SABER further supports four discrete
inference modes - NoThink, FastThink, CoreThink, and DeepThink, enabling
flexible trade-offs between latency and reasoning depth. Extensive evaluations
on math reasoning (MATH, GSM8K), code generation (MBPP), and logical reasoning
(LiveBench-Reasoning) demonstrate that SABER achieves high accuracy under tight
budgets, graceful degradation, and effective cross-scale and cross-domain
generalization. In particular, SABER-FastThink cuts reasoning length by 65.4%
and yields a 3.6% accuracy gain compared with the base model on the MATH
benchmark.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合Transformer嵌入和手工特征的多模态方法，利用LLM生成合成语音增强数据，用于阿尔茨海默病早期检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病及相关痴呆症（ADRD）在美国影响约500万老年人，但超过一半未被诊断。基于语音的自然语言处理（NLP）提供了一种可扩展的早期检测方法。

Method: 开发了一个筛查流程，结合Transformer嵌入与手工特征，测试LLM生成的合成语音数据增强，并评估单模态和多模态LLM分类器。

Result: 融合模型表现最佳（F1=83.3），合成语音数据增强进一步提升性能（F1=85.7），但多模态模型表现较低（如GPT-4o F1=70.2）。

Conclusion: 结合Transformer嵌入和手工特征可提升ADRD检测效果，LLM在分类和数据增强中有效，但多模态模型仍需改进。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect approximately five
million older adults in the U.S., yet over half remain undiagnosed.
Speech-based natural language processing (NLP) offers a promising, scalable
approach to detect early cognitive decline through linguistic markers.
  To develop and evaluate a screening pipeline that (i) fuses transformer
embeddings with handcrafted linguistic features, (ii) tests data augmentation
using synthetic speech generated by large language models (LLMs), and (iii)
benchmarks unimodal and multimodal LLM classifiers for ADRD detection.
  Transcripts from the DementiaBank "cookie-theft" task (n = 237) were used.
Ten transformer models were evaluated under three fine-tuning strategies. A
fusion model combined embeddings from the top-performing transformer with 110
lexical-derived linguistic features. Five LLMs (LLaMA-8B/70B, MedAlpaca-7B,
Ministral-8B, GPT-4o) were fine-tuned to generate label-conditioned synthetic
speech, which was used to augment training data. Three multimodal models
(GPT-4o, Qwen-Omni, Phi-4) were tested for speech-text classification in
zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
  The fusion model achieved F1 = 83.3 (AUC = 89.5), outperforming linguistic or
transformer-only baselines. Augmenting training data with 2x MedAlpaca-7B
synthetic speech increased F1 to 85.7. Fine-tuning significantly improved
unimodal LLM classifiers (e.g., MedAlpaca: F1 = 47.3 -> 78.5 F1). Current
multimodal models demonstrated lower performance (GPT-4o = 70.2 F1; Qwen =
66.0). Performance gains aligned with the distributional similarity between
synthetic and real speech.
  Integrating transformer embeddings with linguistic features enhances ADRD
detection from speech. Clinically tuned LLMs effectively support both
classification and data augmentation, while further advancement is needed in
multimodal modeling.

Motivation: 现有评估方法忽视用户个性化需求，PREF旨在填补这一空白，提供更可靠、可扩展的个性化文本生成评估。

Method: PREF采用三步流程：1) 使用LLM生成通用评估准则；2) 结合用户偏好生成个性化评分标准；3) 用LLM评分。

Result: 在PrefEval基准测试中，PREF在准确性、校准和与人类判断一致性上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PREF为个性化语言生成系统的评估和开发提供了可扩展、可解释且用户对齐的基础。

Abstract: Personalised text generation is essential for user-centric information
systems, yet most evaluation methods overlook the individuality of users. We
introduce \textbf{PREF}, a \textbf{P}ersonalised \textbf{R}eference-free
\textbf{E}valuation \textbf{F}ramework that jointly measures general output
quality and user-specific alignment without requiring gold personalised
references. PREF operates in a three-step pipeline: (1) a coverage stage uses a
large language model (LLM) to generate a comprehensive, query-specific
guideline covering universal criteria such as factuality, coherence, and
completeness; (2) a preference stage re-ranks and selectively augments these
factors using the target user's profile, stated or inferred preferences, and
context, producing a personalised evaluation rubric; and (3) a scoring stage
applies an LLM judge to rate candidate answers against this rubric, ensuring
baseline adequacy while capturing subjective priorities. This separation of
coverage from preference improves robustness, transparency, and reusability,
and allows smaller models to approximate the personalised quality of larger
ones. Experiments on the PrefEval benchmark, including implicit
preference-following tasks, show that PREF achieves higher accuracy, better
calibration, and closer alignment with human judgments than strong baselines.
By enabling scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, PREF lays the
groundwork for more reliable assessment and development of personalised
language generation systems.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在语言任务中表现出色，但容易受到绕过安全对齐的越狱攻击。研究旨在开发一种更有效的攻击方法，并探索防御策略。

Method: LFJ通过选择主题和句法相似的查询对，在关键层和令牌上进行梯度引导插值，并通过优化平衡攻击成功率、输出流畅性和计算效率。

Result: 在Vicuna和LLaMA-2等模型上，LFJ的平均攻击成功率为94.01%，优于现有方法。提出的对抗训练防御方法将攻击成功率降低了80%以上。

Conclusion: LFJ是一种高效的越狱攻击方法，其成功依赖于查询对选择、隐藏状态插值和优化策略。对抗训练是有效的防御手段。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in various
language tasks but are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that circumvent their
safety alignments. This paper introduces Latent Fusion Jailbreak (LFJ), a
representation-based attack that interpolates hidden states from harmful and
benign query pairs to elicit prohibited responses. LFJ begins by selecting
query pairs with high thematic and syntactic similarity, then performs
gradient-guided interpolation at influential layers and tokens, followed by
optimization to balance attack success, output fluency, and computational
efficiency. Evaluations on models such as Vicuna and LLaMA-2 across benchmarks
like AdvBench and MaliciousInstruct yield an average attack success rate (ASR)
of 94.01%, outperforming existing methods. To mitigate LFJ, we propose an
adversarial training defense that fine-tunes models on interpolated examples,
reducing ASR by over 80% without degrading performance on benign inputs.
Ablation studies validate the importance of query pair selection, hidden state
interpolation components, and optimization strategies in LFJ's effectiveness.

Result: 在六项任务中验证了PSST的有效性，证明了推理感知在提示优化中的关键作用。

Conclusion: IAPO框架通过联合优化提示和推理规模，显著提升了黑盒LLM的对齐效果。

Abstract: Prompt optimization methods have demonstrated significant effectiveness in
aligning black-box large language models (LLMs). In parallel, inference scaling
strategies such as Best-of-N Sampling and Majority Voting have also proven to
enhance alignment and performance by trading off computation. However, existing
prompt optimization approaches are inference strategy agnostic; that is, they
optimize prompts without regard to the inference strategy employed during
deployment. This constitutes a significant methodological gap, as our empirical
and theoretical analysis reveals a strong interdependence between these two
paradigms. Moreover, we find that user preferences regarding trade-offs among
multiple objectives and inference budgets substantially influence the choice of
prompt and inference configuration. To address this gap, we introduce a unified
novel framework named IAPO (Inference-Aware Prompt Optimization) that jointly
optimizes the prompt and inference scale, while being aware of the inference
budget and different task objectives. We then develop a fixed-budget training
algorithm for IAPO, which we call PSST (Prompt Scaling via Sequential
Trimming), and analyze finite-budget guarantees on error probability. Finally,
we evaluate the effectiveness of PSST on six different tasks, including
multi-objective text generation and reasoning, and demonstrate the critical
role of incorporating inference-awareness when aligning black-box LLMs through
prompt optimization.

Result: 安全思考干预显著降低了LLMs思考模式的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 安全思考干预是缓解LLMs思考模式脆弱性的有效方法。

Abstract: Thinking mode has always been regarded as one of the most valuable modes in
LLMs. However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon:
LLMs with thinking mode are more easily broken by Jailbreak attack. We evaluate
9 LLMs on AdvBench and HarmBench and find that the success rate of attacking
thinking mode in LLMs is almost higher than that of non-thinking mode. Through
large numbers of sample studies, it is found that for educational purposes and
excessively long thinking lengths are the characteristics of successfully
attacked data, and LLMs also give harmful answers when they mostly know that
the questions are harmful. In order to alleviate the above problems, this paper
proposes a method of safe thinking intervention for LLMs, which explicitly
guides the internal thinking processes of LLMs by adding "specific thinking
tokens" of LLMs to the prompt. The results demonstrate that the safe thinking
intervention can significantly reduce the attack success rate of LLMs with
thinking mode.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable potential for few-shot
information extraction (IE), yet their performance is highly sensitive to the
choice of in-context examples. Conventional selection strategies often fail to
provide informative guidance, as they overlook a key source of model
fallibility: confusion stemming not just from semantic content, but also from
the generation of well-structured formats required by IE tasks. To address
this, we introduce Active Prompting for Information Extraction (APIE), a novel
active prompting framework guided by a principle we term introspective
confusion. Our method empowers an LLM to assess its own confusion through a
dual-component uncertainty metric that uniquely quantifies both Format
Uncertainty (difficulty in generating correct syntax) and Content Uncertainty
(inconsistency in extracted semantics). By ranking unlabeled data with this
comprehensive score, our framework actively selects the most challenging and
informative samples to serve as few-shot exemplars. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, yielding significant improvements in both extraction accuracy and
robustness. Our work highlights the critical importance of a fine-grained,
dual-level view of model uncertainty when it comes to building effective and
reliable structured generation systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-reinforced Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, the
mechanism underlying their utilization of different human reasoning skills
remains poorly investigated, especially for multilingual commonsense reasoning
that involves everyday knowledge across different languages and cultures. To
address this gap, we propose a \textbf{M}ultilingual and Scalable Benchmark for
\textbf{S}kill-based \textbf{Co}mmonsense \textbf{Re}asoning (\textbf{mSCoRe}).
Our benchmark incorporates three key components that are designed to
systematically evaluate LLM's reasoning capabilities, including: (1) a novel
taxonomy of reasoning skills that enables fine-grained analysis of models'
reasoning processes, (2) a robust data synthesis pipeline tailored specifically
for commonsense reasoning evaluation, and (3) a complexity scaling framework
allowing task difficulty to scale dynamically alongside future improvements in
LLM abilities. Extensive experiments on eights state-of-the-art LLMs of varying
sizes and training approaches demonstrate that \textbf{mSCoRe} remains
significantly challenging for current models, particularly at higher complexity
levels. Our results reveal the limitations of such reasoning-reinforced models
when confronted with nuanced multilingual general and cultural commonsense. We
further provide detailed analysis on the models' reasoning processes,
suggesting future directions for improving multilingual commonsense reasoning
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在复杂、交互式任务中表现不佳，需要开发能够处理多轮对话和推理的模型。

Method: 引入了一套多轮任务基准测试，每个任务测试特定能力，并采用确定性评分机制。

Result: 评估显示当前模型在指令遵循、推理和规划方面存在明显不足。

Conclusion: 该基准为改进大语言模型在复杂交互场景中的能力提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving problems with clear and
complete statements, but often struggle with nuanced environments or
interactive tasks which are common in most real-world scenarios. This
highlights the critical need for developing LLMs that can effectively engage in
logically consistent multi-turn dialogue, seek information and reason with
incomplete data. To this end, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising a suite
of multi-turn tasks each designed to test specific reasoning, interactive
dialogue, and information-seeking abilities. These tasks have deterministic
scoring mechanisms, thus eliminating the need for human intervention.
Evaluating frontier models on our benchmark reveals significant headroom. Our
analysis shows that most errors emerge from poor instruction following,
reasoning failures, and poor planning. This benchmark provides valuable
insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs in handling complex,
interactive scenarios and offers a robust platform for future research aimed at
improving these critical capabilities.

TL;DR: LaaJMeter是一个基于模拟的框架，用于在特定领域中对LLM评估器进行元评估，解决数据稀缺和专家评估成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在领域特定任务中，LLM评估器（LaaJ）的元评估缺乏验证，难以确定有效指标和性能阈值。

Method: 提出LaaJMeter框架，通过生成合成数据和虚拟模型，系统分析评估指标在现实条件下的表现。

Result: 在代码翻译任务中，展示了不同指标对评估质量的敏感性，揭示了常见指标的局限性。

Conclusion: LaaJMeter为低资源环境下的LLM评估提供了可扩展的解决方案，有助于提升NLP评估的可信度和可重复性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in natural
language processing tasks, a paradigm known as LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ). While
effective in general domains, LaaJs pose significant challenges in
domain-specific contexts, where annotated data is scarce and expert evaluation
is costly. In such cases, meta-evaluation is often performed using metrics that
have not been validated for the specific domain in which they are applied. As a
result, it becomes difficult to determine which metrics effectively identify
LaaJ quality, and further, what threshold indicates sufficient evaluator
performance. In this work, we introduce LaaJMeter, a simulation-based framework
for controlled meta-evaluation of LaaJs. LaaJMeter enables engineers to
generate synthetic data representing virtual models and judges, allowing
systematic analysis of evaluation metrics under realistic conditions. This
helps practitioners validate and refine LaaJs for specific evaluation tasks:
they can test whether their metrics correctly distinguish between better and
worse (virtual) LaaJs, and estimate appropriate thresholds for evaluator
adequacy.
  We demonstrate the utility of LaaJMeter in a code translation task involving
a legacy programming language, showing how different metrics vary in
sensitivity to evaluator quality. Our results highlight the limitations of
common metrics and the importance of principled metric selection. LaaJMeter
provides a scalable and extensible solution for assessing LaaJs in low-resource
settings, contributing to the broader effort to ensure trustworthy and
reproducible evaluation in NLP.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种翻译难度估计任务，并引入新指标评估方法，展示了其在实际构建更具挑战性机器翻译基准中的价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器翻译质量接近完美，难以区分模型优劣和识别改进方向，需自动识别翻译困难文本以推动研究。

Method: 定义文本翻译难度，提出新评估指标，比较启发式方法和LLM方法，开发专用模型Sentinel-src。

Result: Sentinel-src模型优于启发式方法和LLM方法，并发布了两个改进模型Sentinel-src-24和Sentinel-src-25。

Conclusion: 翻译难度估计任务有助于构建更具挑战性的基准，推动机器翻译研究发展。

Abstract: Machine translation quality has began achieving near-perfect translations in
some setups. These high-quality outputs make it difficult to distinguish
between state-of-the-art models and to identify areas for future improvement.
Automatically identifying texts where machine translation systems struggle
holds promise for developing more discriminative evaluations and guiding future
research.
  We formalize the task of translation difficulty estimation, defining a text's
difficulty based on the expected quality of its translations. We introduce a
new metric to evaluate difficulty estimators and use it to assess both
baselines and novel approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility
of difficulty estimators by using them to construct more challenging machine
translation benchmarks. Our results show that dedicated models (dubbed
Sentinel-src) outperform both heuristic-based methods (e.g. word rarity or
syntactic complexity) and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. We release two improved
models for difficulty estimation, Sentinel-src-24 and Sentinel-src-25, which
can be used to scan large collections of texts and select those most likely to
challenge contemporary machine translation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高大型语言模型和视觉语言模型的透明度和可解释性，但现有方法计算成本高。

Method: 利用基础模型的丰富表示，通过单次前向传播计算影响分数，避免梯度计算。

Result: For-Value在识别重要微调样本和检测错误标记数据方面表现优异。

Conclusion: For-Value为高效、可扩展的数据评估提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Quantifying the influence of individual training samples is essential for
enhancing the transparency and accountability of large language models (LLMs)
and vision-language models (VLMs). However, existing data valuation methods
often rely on Hessian information or model retraining, making them
computationally prohibitive for billion-parameter models. In this work, we
introduce For-Value, a forward-only data valuation framework that enables
scalable and efficient influence estimation for both LLMs and VLMs. By
leveraging the rich representations of modern foundation models, For-Value
computes influence scores using a simple closed-form expression based solely on
a single forward pass, thereby eliminating the need for costly gradient
computations. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that For-Value accurately
estimates per-sample influence by capturing alignment in hidden representations
and prediction errors between training and validation samples. Extensive
experiments show that For-Value matches or outperforms gradient-based baselines
in identifying impactful fine-tuning examples and effectively detecting
mislabeled data.

TL;DR: PakBBQ是一个针对巴基斯坦文化和区域背景的偏见基准数据集，用于评估多语言大语言模型（LLMs）的公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs主要基于西方中心数据训练和评估，忽视了低资源语言和区域背景的公平性。

Method: 引入PakBBQ数据集，包含214个模板和17180个QA对，覆盖8个偏见维度，并在英语和乌尔都语中评估LLMs。

Result: 实验显示，消歧后准确率提升12%，乌尔都语的反偏见行为更强，负面提问减少刻板回答。

Conclusion: 上下文化基准和简单提示工程对低资源环境中的偏见缓解至关重要。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various
applications, it is empirical to ensure their fairness across all user
communities. However, most LLMs are trained and evaluated on Western centric
data, with little attention paid to low-resource languages and regional
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce PakBBQ, a culturally and regionally
adapted extension of the original Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ)
dataset. PakBBQ comprises over 214 templates, 17180 QA pairs across 8
categories in both English and Urdu, covering eight bias dimensions including
age, disability, appearance, gender, socio-economic status, religious, regional
affiliation, and language formality that are relevant in Pakistan. We evaluate
multiple multilingual LLMs under both ambiguous and explicitly disambiguated
contexts, as well as negative versus non negative question framings. Our
experiments reveal (i) an average accuracy gain of 12\% with disambiguation,
(ii) consistently stronger counter bias behaviors in Urdu than in English, and
(iii) marked framing effects that reduce stereotypical responses when questions
are posed negatively. These findings highlight the importance of contextualized
benchmarks and simple prompt engineering strategies for bias mitigation in low
resource settings.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by
hallucinations, critical failure modes where models generate non-factual,
nonsensical or unfaithful text. This paper introduces Semantic Divergence
Metrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness
Hallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input
contexts. We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors,
{confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically
misaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test
for arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed
prompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we
test for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not
only across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent
paraphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint
clustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts
and answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can
be viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine
dialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure
the semantic divergence between prompts and responses. Our practical score,
$\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein
distance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a
Faithfulness hallucination. Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence
KL(Answer $||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \textbf{Semantic
Exploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors.
These metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic
framework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous,
confident confabulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPRS评分需长时间结构化访谈，临床实践中不常用，LLM可简化此过程。

Method: 使用LLM分析409名CHR患者的临床访谈转录，预测BPRS评分，评估零样本、跨语言和纵向学习能力。

Result: LLM预测与真实评估一致性高（中位数一致性0.84，ICC 0.73），跨语言和纵向学习表现优异。

Conclusion: LLM在CHR患者评估中具有潜力，可提高标准化和效率。

Abstract: Patients who are at clinical high risk (CHR) for schizophrenia need close
monitoring of their symptoms to inform appropriate treatments. The Brief
Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is a validated, commonly used research tool for
measuring symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic
disorders; however, it is not commonly used in clinical practice as it requires
a lengthy structured interview. Here, we utilize large language models (LLMs)
to predict BPRS scores from clinical interview transcripts in 409 CHR patients
from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Schizophrenia (AMP-SCZ) cohort.
Despite the interviews not being specifically structured to measure the BPRS,
the zero-shot performance of the LLM predictions compared to the true
assessment (median concordance: 0.84, ICC: 0.73) approaches human inter- and
intra-rater reliability. We further demonstrate that LLMs have substantial
potential to improve and standardize the assessment of CHR patients via their
accuracy in assessing the BPRS in foreign languages (median concordance: 0.88,
ICC: 0.70), and integrating longitudinal information in a one-shot or few-shot
learning approach.

Motivation: 探究构造语言Toki Pona是否像自然语言一样受社会语言学因素影响，并观察其语言变化。

Method: 采用计算和语料库方法，分析词类流动性和及物性，比较不同语料库中的使用差异。

Result: Toki Pona的语言变化受社会语言学因素影响，构造语言系统会随社区使用自然演化。

Conclusion: 构造语言Toki Pona的演变与自然语言相似，社区使用促使其自然发展。

Abstract: This study explores language change and variation in Toki Pona, a constructed
language with approximately 120 core words. Taking a computational and
corpus-based approach, the study examines features including fluid word classes
and transitivity in order to examine (1) changes in preferences of content
words for different syntactic positions over time and (2) variation in usage
across different corpora. The results suggest that sociolinguistic factors
influence Toki Pona in the same way as natural languages, and that even
constructed linguistic systems naturally evolve as communities use them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现LLM对提示词微小变化敏感，部分源于其内在的归纳偏置。利用LLM输出优化提示词，可更高效地匹配模型偏置。

Method: 提出归纳偏置提取与匹配策略，将LLM输出作为提示词的一部分，生成更符合模型偏置的提示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法使分类任务的Likert评分提升19%，排序任务提升27%。

Conclusion: 归纳偏置提取与匹配策略能有效优化提示词，显著提升LLM任务表现。

Abstract: The active research topic of prompt engineering makes it evident that LLMs
are sensitive to small changes in prompt wording. A portion of this can be
ascribed to the inductive bias that is present in the LLM. By using an LLM's
output as a portion of its prompt, we can more easily create satisfactory
wording for prompts. This has the effect of creating a prompt that matches the
inductive bias in model. Empirically, we show that using this Inductive Bias
Extraction and Matching strategy improves LLM Likert ratings used for
classification by up to 19% and LLM Likert ratings used for ranking by up to
27%.

Result: 黑人女性被描绘为与祖先和抵抗相关，白人女性则表现为自我发现；模型修正偏见时仅做表面调整。

Conclusion: 需采用批判性、跨学科方法设计AI，以解决LLM输出中的不平等问题。

Abstract: With the advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models
(LLMs) have gained prominence and been applied in diverse contexts. As they
evolve into more sophisticated versions, it is essential to assess whether they
reproduce biases, such as discrimination and racialization, while maintaining
hegemonic discourses. Current bias detection approaches rely mostly on
quantitative, automated methods, which often overlook the nuanced ways in which
biases emerge in natural language. This study proposes a qualitative,
discursive framework to complement such methods. Through manual analysis of
LLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women, we investigate
gender and racial biases. We contend that qualitative methods such as the one
proposed here are fundamental to help both developers and users identify the
precise ways in which biases manifest in LLM outputs, thus enabling better
conditions to mitigate them. Results show that Black women are portrayed as
tied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appear in self-discovery
processes. These patterns reflect how language models replicate crystalized
discursive representations, reinforcing essentialization and a sense of social
immobility. When prompted to correct biases, models offered superficial
revisions that maintained problematic meanings, revealing limitations in
fostering inclusive narratives. Our results demonstrate the ideological
functioning of algorithms and have significant implications for the ethical use
and development of AI. The study reinforces the need for critical,
interdisciplinary approaches to AI design and deployment, addressing how
LLM-generated discourses reflect and perpetuate inequalities.

Abstract: Peer review is essential for scientific progress but faces growing challenges
due to increasing submission volumes and reviewer fatigue. Existing automated
review approaches struggle with factual accuracy, rating consistency, and
analytical depth, often generating superficial or generic feedback lacking the
insights characteristic of high-quality human reviews. We introduce ReviewRL, a
reinforcement learning framework for generating comprehensive and factually
grounded scientific paper reviews. Our approach combines: (1) an ArXiv-MCP
retrieval-augmented context generation pipeline that incorporates relevant
scientific literature, (2) supervised fine-tuning that establishes foundational
reviewing capabilities, and (3) a reinforcement learning procedure with a
composite reward function that jointly enhances review quality and rating
accuracy. Experiments on ICLR 2025 papers demonstrate that ReviewRL
significantly outperforms existing methods across both rule-based metrics and
model-based quality assessments. ReviewRL establishes a foundational framework
for RL-driven automatic critique generation in scientific discovery,
demonstrating promising potential for future development in this domain. The
implementation of ReviewRL will be released at GitHub.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注表格的表面任务（如布局分析、检测和数据提取），缺乏对表格及其上下文语义关联的深度解析，限制了高级任务的实现。

Method: DOTABLER通过定制数据集和预训练模型的领域微调，构建完整的解析流程，识别与表格语义关联的上下文片段，并实现表格中心文档结构解析和领域特定表格检索。

Result: 在近4000页真实PDF文档（含1000多个表格）的评估中，DOTABLER的Precision和F1分数超过90%，性能优于GPT-4o等先进模型。

Conclusion: DOTABLER在表格-上下文语义分析和深度文档解析方面表现出色，为高级语义任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Documents are core carriers of information and knowl-edge, with broad
applications in finance, healthcare, and scientific research. Tables, as the
main medium for structured data, encapsulate key information and are among the
most critical document components. Existing studies largely focus on
surface-level tasks such as layout analysis, table detection, and data
extraction, lacking deep semantic parsing of tables and their contextual
associations. This limits advanced tasks like cross-paragraph data
interpretation and context-consistent analysis. To address this, we propose
DOTABLER, a table-centric semantic document parsing framework designed to
uncover deep semantic links between tables and their context. DOTABLER
leverages a custom dataset and domain-specific fine-tuning of pre-trained
models, integrating a complete parsing pipeline to identify context segments
semantically tied to tables. Built on this semantic understanding, DOTABLER
implements two core functionalities: table-centric document structure parsing
and domain-specific table retrieval, delivering comprehensive table-anchored
semantic analysis and precise extraction of semantically relevant tables.
Evaluated on nearly 4,000 pages with over 1,000 tables from real-world PDFs,
DOTABLER achieves over 90% Precision and F1 scores, demonstrating superior
performance in table-context semantic analysis and deep document parsing
compared to advanced models such as GPT-4o.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推荐系统过度强调语义关联，导致协作信号衰减，影响推荐性能。

Method: 使用G-LPF过滤高频噪声，并通过TFM逐层保留协作信号，理论保证其有效性。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，NDCG@10提升高达8.00%，性能优于基线。

Conclusion: FreLLM4Rec为LLM处理协作信息提供了新思路，改进了推荐系统性能。

Abstract: Recommender systems in concert with Large Language Models (LLMs) present
promising avenues for generating semantically-informed recommendations.
However, LLM-based recommenders exhibit a tendency to overemphasize semantic
correlations within users' interaction history. When taking pretrained
collaborative ID embeddings as input, LLM-based recommenders progressively
weaken the inherent collaborative signals as the embeddings propagate through
LLM backbones layer by layer, as opposed to traditional Transformer-based
sequential models in which collaborative signals are typically preserved or
even enhanced for state-of-the-art performance. To address this limitation, we
introduce FreLLM4Rec, an approach designed to balance semantic and
collaborative information from a spectral perspective. Item embeddings that
incorporate both semantic and collaborative information are first purified
using a Global Graph Low-Pass Filter (G-LPF) to preliminarily remove irrelevant
high-frequency noise. Temporal Frequency Modulation (TFM) then actively
preserves collaborative signal layer by layer. Note that the collaborative
preservation capability of TFM is theoretically guaranteed by establishing a
connection between the optimal but hard-to-implement local graph fourier
filters and the suboptimal yet computationally efficient frequency-domain
filters. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FreLLM4Rec successfully mitigates collaborative signal attenuation and achieves
competitive performance, with improvements of up to 8.00\% in NDCG@10 over the
best baseline. Our findings provide insights into how LLMs process
collaborative information and offer a principled approach for improving
LLM-based recommendation systems.

Method: 提出XPE（轻量级编码架构结合多源训练）和双软提示机制（结合编码器提示和直接训练的软提示）。

Result: 实验表明XPE对低性能语言最有效，而混合设计在多语言环境中适应性更强。

Conclusion: XPE和双软提示机制为多语言任务提供了高效解决方案，尤其适用于低性能语言。

Abstract: Soft prompts have emerged as a powerful alternative to adapters in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), enabling large language models (LLMs)
to adapt to downstream tasks without architectural changes or parameter
updates. While prior work has focused on stabilizing training via parameter
interaction in small neural prompt encoders, their broader potential for
transfer across languages remains unexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate
that a prompt encoder can play a central role in improving performance on
low-performing languages-those that achieve poor accuracy even under full-model
fine-tuning. We introduce the Cross-Prompt Encoder (XPE), which combines a
lightweight encoding architecture with multi-source training on typologically
diverse languages - a design that enables the model to capture abstract and
transferable patterns across languages. To complement XPE, we propose a Dual
Soft Prompt mechanism that combines an encoder-based prompt with a directly
trained standard soft prompt. This hybrid design proves especially effective
for target languages that benefit from both broadly shared structure and
language-specific alignment. Experiments on the SIB-200 benchmark reveal a
consistent trade-off: XPE is most effective for low-performing languages, while
hybrid variants offer broader adaptability across multilingual settings.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在韩语推理任务中的表现不足问题，并提升其整体推理能力。

Method: 第一阶段使用监督微调（SFT）在高质量韩语推理数据集上训练；第二阶段采用定制的GRPO算法进行强化学习，并通过引入oracle judge模型解决训练稳定性问题。

Result: 模型在韩语推理任务中表现显著提升，同时在数学和编程任务中也有进步，且能完全以韩语进行内部思维链。

Conclusion: 两阶段微调方法有效提升了模型在韩语推理任务中的性能，同时保持了语言和知识的熟练度。

Abstract: We present a two-stage fine-tuning approach to make the large language model
Qwen3 14B "think" natively in Korean. In the first stage, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on a high-quality Korean reasoning dataset establishes a
strong foundation in Korean logical reasoning, yielding notable improvements in
Korean-language tasks and even some gains in general reasoning ability. In the
second stage, we employ reinforcement learning with a customized Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to further enhance both Korean reasoning
alignment and overall problem-solving performance. We address critical
stability challenges in GRPO training - such as reward hacking and policy
collapse - by introducing an oracle judge model that calibrates the reward
signal. Our approach achieves stable learning (avoiding the collapse observed
in naive GRPO) and leads to steady, incremental performance gains. The final
RL-tuned model demonstrates substantially improved results on advanced
reasoning benchmarks (particularly math and coding tasks) while maintaining
knowledge and language proficiency, successfully conducting its internal
chain-of-thought entirely in Korean.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言在ABSA任务中的挑战，减少对外部翻译工具的依赖。

Method: 采用约束解码的序列到序列方法。

Result: 性能提升10%，并能处理更复杂的任务。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨语言ABSA提供了高效实用的解决方案，优于依赖翻译的技术。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made significant strides, yet
challenges remain for low-resource languages due to the predominant focus on
English. Current cross-lingual ABSA studies often centre on simpler tasks and
rely heavily on external translation tools. In this paper, we present a novel
sequence-to-sequence method for compound ABSA tasks that eliminates the need
for such tools. Our approach, which uses constrained decoding, improves
cross-lingual ABSA performance by up to 10\%. This method broadens the scope of
cross-lingual ABSA, enabling it to handle more complex tasks and providing a
practical, efficient alternative to translation-dependent techniques.
Furthermore, we compare our approach with large language models (LLMs) and show
that while fine-tuned multilingual LLMs can achieve comparable results,
English-centric LLMs struggle with these tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 捷克语文本摘要，尤其是历史文档摘要，因语言复杂性和标注数据稀缺而研究不足。

Method: 采用Mistral和mT5等大型语言模型进行捷克语摘要任务。

Result: 在现代捷克语摘要数据集SumeCzech上取得新最优结果，并发布历史文档数据集Posel od Čerchova及基线结果。

Conclusion: 这些成果推动了捷克语文本摘要研究，并为历史文本处理开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Text summarization is the task of shortening a larger body of text into a
concise version while retaining its essential meaning and key information.
While summarization has been significantly explored in English and other
high-resource languages, Czech text summarization, particularly for historical
documents, remains underexplored due to linguistic complexities and a scarcity
of annotated datasets. Large language models such as Mistral and mT5 have
demonstrated excellent results on many natural language processing tasks and
languages. Therefore, we employ these models for Czech summarization, resulting
in two key contributions: (1) achieving new state-of-the-art results on the
modern Czech summarization dataset SumeCzech using these advanced models, and
(2) introducing a novel dataset called Posel od \v{C}erchova for summarization
of historical Czech documents with baseline results. Together, these
contributions provide a great potential for advancing Czech text summarization
and open new avenues for research in Czech historical text processing.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于约束解码的序列到序列模型方法，用于跨语言方面情感分析（ABSA），无需依赖翻译工具，性能提升5%，并支持多任务处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言在ABSA任务中被忽视的问题，改进现有跨语言方法的局限性。

Method: 采用约束解码的序列到序列模型，支持多任务处理，避免使用翻译工具。

Result: 在七种语言和六项ABSA任务中超越现有方法，性能提升5%-10%。大语言模型（LLMs）在微调后表现接近小型多语言模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨语言ABSA提供了实用解决方案，并揭示了LLMs在此领域的潜力与限制。

Abstract: While aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made substantial progress,
challenges remain for low-resource languages, which are often overlooked in
favour of English. Current cross-lingual ABSA approaches focus on limited, less
complex tasks and often rely on external translation tools. This paper
introduces a novel approach using constrained decoding with
sequence-to-sequence models, eliminating the need for unreliable translation
tools and improving cross-lingual performance by 5\% on average for the most
complex task. The proposed method also supports multi-tasking, which enables
solving multiple ABSA tasks with a single model, with constrained decoding
boosting results by more than 10\%.
  We evaluate our approach across seven languages and six ABSA tasks,
surpassing state-of-the-art methods and setting new benchmarks for previously
unexplored tasks. Additionally, we assess large language models (LLMs) in
zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. While LLMs perform poorly in
zero-shot and few-shot settings, fine-tuning achieves competitive results
compared to smaller multilingual models, albeit at the cost of longer training
and inference times.
  We provide practical recommendations for real-world applications, enhancing
the understanding of cross-lingual ABSA methodologies. This study offers
valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of cross-lingual ABSA
approaches, advancing the state-of-the-art in this challenging research domain.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合评估框架MDH，结合LLM和人工辅助，用于恶意内容检测和数据集清理，并提出了两种新的攻击策略D-Attack和DH-CoT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有恶意内容检测方法依赖人工或LLM，效率或准确性不足，需平衡两者。

Method: 提出MDH框架，结合LLM和少量人工监督；开发D-Attack和DH-CoT两种新攻击策略。

Result: MDH框架有效提升检测效率；D-Attack和DH-CoT显著提高攻击成功率。

Conclusion: MDH框架和新型攻击策略为恶意内容检测和对抗攻击提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating jailbreak attacks is challenging when prompts are not overtly
harmful or fail to induce harmful outputs. Unfortunately, many existing
red-teaming datasets contain such unsuitable prompts. To evaluate attacks
accurately, these datasets need to be assessed and cleaned for maliciousness.
However, existing malicious content detection methods rely on either manual
annotation, which is labor-intensive, or large language models (LLMs), which
have inconsistent accuracy in harmful types. To balance accuracy and
efficiency, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework named MDH (Malicious
content Detection based on LLMs with Human assistance) that combines LLM-based
annotation with minimal human oversight, and apply it to dataset cleaning and
detection of jailbroken responses. Furthermore, we find that well-crafted
developer messages can significantly boost jailbreak success, leading us to
propose two new strategies: D-Attack, which leverages context simulation, and
DH-CoT, which incorporates hijacked chains of thought. The Codes, datasets,
judgements, and detection results will be released in github repository:

Motivation: 随着NLP和LLMs的快速发展，生成对抗样本以揭示模型漏洞和提升鲁棒性成为关键挑战。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器识别和操纵文本关键特征，通过特征聚类和选择性扰动生成对抗文本。

Result: 实验表明，SFPF生成的对抗文本能绕过最先进的防御机制，揭示NLP系统的持续漏洞。

Conclusion: 该方法在对抗效果与安全性间取得平衡，但其通用性和对不同架构的适应性仍需验证。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially
Large Language Models (LLMs), generating adversarial examples to jailbreak LLMs
remains a key challenge for understanding model vulnerabilities and improving
robustness. In this context, we propose a new black-box attack method that
leverages the interpretability of large models. We introduce the Sparse Feature
Perturbation Framework (SFPF), a novel approach for adversarial text generation
that utilizes sparse autoencoders to identify and manipulate critical features
in text. After using the SAE model to reconstruct hidden layer representations,
we perform feature clustering on the successfully attacked texts to identify
features with higher activations. These highly activated features are then
perturbed to generate new adversarial texts. This selective perturbation
preserves the malicious intent while amplifying safety signals, thereby
increasing their potential to evade existing defenses. Our method enables a new
red-teaming strategy that balances adversarial effectiveness with safety
alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that adversarial texts generated by
SFPF can bypass state-of-the-art defense mechanisms, revealing persistent
vulnerabilities in current NLP systems.However, the method's effectiveness
varies across prompts and layers, and its generalizability to other
architectures and larger models remains to be validated.

Motivation: 传统RAG方法在长上下文叙事理解中存在局限性，因其静态、单步检索过程无法捕捉动态关系。ComoRAG旨在模拟人类认知的动态推理过程。

Method: ComoRAG采用迭代推理循环，通过动态内存工作区生成探测查询并整合新证据，逐步构建全局上下文。

Result: 在四个长上下文叙事基准测试中，ComoRAG比最强基线提升了11%的性能，尤其在需要全局理解的复杂查询中表现突出。

Conclusion: ComoRAG为基于检索的长上下文理解提供了一种认知启发的、状态感知的推理范式，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging
domain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving
relations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning
over extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches
remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall
short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often
overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within
long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle
that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving
interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation,
analogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the
brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes
iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.
In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,
then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory
pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query
resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+
tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative
gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals
that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global
comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for
retrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning. Our code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了IdiomEval框架，用于评估中文成语的机器翻译质量，发现现有系统表现不佳，并开发了改进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文成语的翻译在机器翻译中研究较少，现有系统表现不佳，需要更全面的评估和改进方法。

Method: 构建IdiomEval框架，标注900个翻译对，分析错误类型，并提出改进模型。

Result: 现有系统（如GPT-4和Google翻译）在成语翻译中错误率高，最佳系统错误率为28%；改进模型F1分数达0.68。

Conclusion: 中文成语翻译仍具挑战性，改进模型表现优于现有系统，但仍有提升空间。

Abstract: Idioms, whose figurative meanings usually differ from their literal
interpretations, are common in everyday language, especially in Chinese, where
they often contain historical references and follow specific structural
patterns. Despite recent progress in machine translation with large language
models, little is known about Chinese idiom translation. In this work, we
introduce IdiomEval, a framework with a comprehensive error taxonomy for
Chinese idiom translation. We annotate 900 translation pairs from nine modern
systems, including GPT-4o and Google Translate, across four domains: web, news,
Wikipedia, and social media. We find these systems fail at idiom translation,
producing incorrect, literal, partial, or even missing translations. The
best-performing system, GPT-4, makes errors in 28% of cases. We also find that
existing evaluation metrics measure idiom quality poorly with Pearson
correlation below 0.48 with human ratings. We thus develop improved models that
achieve F$_1$ scores of 0.68 for detecting idiom translation errors.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于‘计算经济学’框架的方法，通过激励驱动的训练范式优化LLMs的计算资源分配，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的计算成本高昂，限制了其应用。

Method: 引入‘计算经济学’框架，将LLMs视为资源受限的代理（注意力头和神经元块）的经济体，通过激励驱动的训练范式优化计算资源分配。

Result: 在GLUE和WikiText-103任务上，该方法在保持准确性的同时降低了约40%的FLOPS和延迟，并生成更可解释的注意力模式。

Conclusion: 经济原则为设计高效、自适应且透明的LLMs提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are limited by substantial computational cost.
We introduce a "computational economics" framework that treats an LLM as an
internal economy of resource-constrained agents (attention heads and neuron
blocks) that must allocate scarce computation to maximize task utility. First,
we show empirically that when computation is scarce, standard LLMs reallocate
attention toward high-value tokens while preserving accuracy. Building on this
observation, we propose an incentive-driven training paradigm that augments the
task loss with a differentiable computation cost term, encouraging sparse and
efficient activations. On GLUE (MNLI, STS-B, CoLA) and WikiText-103, the method
yields a family of models that trace a Pareto frontier and consistently
dominate post-hoc pruning; for a similar accuracy we obtain roughly a forty
percent reduction in FLOPS and lower latency, together with more interpretable
attention patterns. These results indicate that economic principles offer a
principled route to designing efficient, adaptive, and more transparent LLMs
under strict resource constraints.

Motivation: 解决现有大型视觉语言模型生成解释时多样性不足、事实错误及内容无关或冲突的问题。

Method: 采用五种思维链提示生成多样推理路径，并通过轻量级后过滤模块筛选事实性和相关性高的句子。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，DiFaR比基线方法提升5.9%，并将现有检测器性能提升8.7%。

Conclusion: DiFaR显著提升了解释的多样性、事实性和相关性，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Generating textual rationales from large vision-language models (LVLMs) to
support trainable multimodal misinformation detectors has emerged as a
promising paradigm. However, its effectiveness is fundamentally limited by
three core challenges: (i) insufficient diversity in generated rationales, (ii)
factual inaccuracies due to hallucinations, and (iii) irrelevant or conflicting
content that introduces noise. We introduce DiFaR, a detector-agnostic
framework that produces diverse, factual, and relevant rationales to enhance
misinformation detection. DiFaR employs five chain-of-thought prompts to elicit
varied reasoning traces from LVLMs and incorporates a lightweight post-hoc
filtering module to select rationale sentences based on sentence-level
factuality and relevance scores. Extensive experiments on four popular
benchmarks demonstrate that DiFaR outperforms four baseline categories by up to
5.9% and boosts existing detectors by as much as 8.7%. Both automatic metrics
and human evaluations confirm that DiFaR significantly improves rationale
quality across all three dimensions.

Conclusion: 总结了隐私与可解释性共存的潜力，并提出了未来研究的实用建议。

Abstract: In the study of trustworthy Natural Language Processing (NLP), a number of
important research fields have emerged, including that of
\textit{explainability} and \textit{privacy}. While research interest in both
explainable and privacy-preserving NLP has increased considerably in recent
years, there remains a lack of investigation at the intersection of the two.
This leaves a considerable gap in understanding of whether achieving
\textit{both} explainability and privacy is possible, or whether the two are at
odds with each other. In this work, we conduct an empirical investigation into
the privacy-explainability trade-off in the context of NLP, guided by the
popular overarching methods of \textit{Differential Privacy} (DP) and Post-hoc
Explainability. Our findings include a view into the intricate relationship
between privacy and explainability, which is formed by a number of factors,
including the nature of the downstream task and choice of the text
privatization and explainability method. In this, we highlight the potential
for privacy and explainability to co-exist, and we summarize our findings in a
collection of practical recommendations for future work at this important
intersection.

Method: 提出两种评估指标（MDI和AEI），分析文本主导的原因，并提出令牌压缩方法以平衡模型注意力。

Result: 研究发现文本主导问题普遍存在，并通过令牌压缩方法显著改善了LLaVA-7B模型的MDI值。

Conclusion: 本文为开发更均衡的多模态语言模型提供了分析框架和方法基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across a diverse range of multimodal tasks. However, these models
suffer from a core problem known as text dominance: they depend heavily on text
for their inference, while underutilizing other modalities. While prior work
has acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it
to data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first
systematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities,
including images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this
imbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index
(MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested
modalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention
dilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence
of fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor
textual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that
effectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for
instance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of
0.86. Our analysis and methodological framework offer a foundation for the
development of more equitable and comprehensive multimodal language models.

mechanistic interpretability research on large language models. The need for
widespread accessibility of LLM interpretability infrastructure in Europe
drives this initiative to democratize advanced model analysis capabilities for
the research community. The project introduces a GPU-based cluster hosted at
Ansbach University of Applied Sciences and interconnected with partner
institutions, enabling remote model inspection via the NNsight API. A
structured pilot study involving 16 researchers from across Europe evaluated
the platform's technical performance, usability, and scientific utility. Users
conducted interventions such as activation patching, causal tracing, and
representation analysis on models including GPT-2 and DeepSeek-R1-70B. The
study revealed a gradual increase in user engagement, stable platform
performance throughout, and a positive reception of the remote experimentation
capabilities. It also marked the starting point for building a user community
around the platform. Identified limitations such as prolonged download
durations for activation data as well as intermittent execution interruptions
are addressed in the roadmap for future development. This initiative marks a
significant step towards widespread accessibility of LLM interpretability
infrastructure in Europe and lays the groundwork for broader deployment,
expanded tooling, and sustained community collaboration in mechanistic

Abstract: Millions of individuals worldwide are affected by deafness and hearing
impairment. Sign language serves as a sophisticated means of communication for
the deaf and hard of hearing. However, in societies that prioritize spoken
languages, sign language often faces underestimation, leading to communication
barriers and social exclusion. The Continuous Bangla Sign Language Translation
project aims to address this gap by enhancing translation methods. While recent
approaches leverage transformer architecture for state-of-the-art results, our
method integrates graph-based methods with the transformer architecture. This
fusion, combining transformer and STGCN-LSTM architectures, proves more
effective in gloss-free translation. Our contributions include architectural
fusion, exploring various fusion strategies, and achieving a new
state-of-the-art performance on diverse sign language datasets, namely
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, How2Sign, and BornilDB v1.0. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance compared to current translation outcomes
across all datasets, showcasing notable improvements of BLEU-4 scores of 4.01,
2.07, and 0.5, surpassing those of GASLT, GASLT and slt_how2sign in
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and How2Sign, respectively. Also, we introduce
benchmarking on the BornilDB v1.0 dataset for the first time. Our method sets a
benchmark for future research, emphasizing the importance of gloss-free
translation to improve communication accessibility for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖标量奖励反馈，学习效率低且个性化质量有限。

Method: VAC框架通过交替优化反馈模型和策略模型，利用NLF作为监督信号。

Result: 在LaMP-QA基准测试中表现优于现有方法，人类评估也证实其优越性。

Conclusion: NLF为个性化问答提供了更有效的优化信号。

Abstract: Personalization is crucial for enhancing both the effectiveness and user
satisfaction of language technologies, particularly in information-seeking
tasks like question answering. Current approaches for personalizing large
language models (LLMs) often rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
followed by reinforcement learning with scalar reward signals to teach models
how to use retrieved personal context. We believe that these scalar rewards
sometimes provide weak, non-instructive feedback, limiting learning efficiency
and personalization quality. We introduce VAC, a novel framework for
personalized response generation that replaces scalar rewards with natural
language feedback (NLF) that are generated conditioned on the user profiles and
the question narratives. NLF serves as a rich and actionable supervision
signal, allowing the policy model to iteratively refine its outputs and
internalize effective personalization strategies. Training alternates between
optimizing the feedback model and fine-tuning the policy model on the improved
responses, resulting in a policy model that no longer requires feedback at
inference. Evaluation on the LaMP-QA benchmark that consists of three diverse
domains demonstrates consistent and significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art results. Human evaluations further confirm the superior
quality of the generated responses. These results demonstrate that NLF provides
more effective signals for optimizing personalized question answering.

with Early Exit), a novel framework that transforms prefix-only prompting into
in-place prompting specifically designed for dLLMs. ICE integrates in-place
prompts directly within masked token positions during iterative refinement and
employs a confidence-aware early exit mechanism to significantly reduce
computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate ICE's effectiveness,
achieving up to 17.29% accuracy improvement with 4.12$\times$ speedup on GSM8K,
and up to 276.67$\times$ acceleration on MMLU while maintaining competitive
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决同行评审中新颖性评估的不足，尤其是在高负荷领域如NLP中，评审资源紧张的问题。

Method: 内容提取、相关文献检索与综合、基于证据的结构化比较，模拟人类评审行为。

Result: 在182份ICLR 2025投稿中，与人类评审的新颖性评估对齐率达86.5%，结论一致率达75.3%。

Conclusion: 结构化LLM辅助方法可提升同行评审的严谨性和透明度，同时保留人类专家的核心作用。

Abstract: Novelty assessment is a central yet understudied aspect of peer review,
particularly in high volume fields like NLP where reviewer capacity is
increasingly strained. We present a structured approach for automated novelty
evaluation that models expert reviewer behavior through three stages: content
extraction from submissions, retrieval and synthesis of related work, and
structured comparison for evidence based assessment. Our method is informed by
a large scale analysis of human written novelty reviews and captures key
patterns such as independent claim verification and contextual reasoning.
Evaluated on 182 ICLR 2025 submissions with human annotated reviewer novelty
assessments, the approach achieves 86.5% alignment with human reasoning and
75.3% agreement on novelty conclusions - substantially outperforming existing
LLM based baselines. The method produces detailed, literature aware analyses
and improves consistency over ad hoc reviewer judgments. These results
highlight the potential for structured LLM assisted approaches to support more
rigorous and transparent peer review without displacing human expertise. Data
and code are made available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MS-GRPO算法通过多步信用分配和优势加权采样策略，提升小型LLM在序列决策任务中的性能，3B模型表现优于72B基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在序列决策任务中潜力巨大，但依赖大模型计算成本高，需改进小型模型。现有方法无法处理多步任务中的信用分配问题。

Method: 提出MS-GRPO算法，基于TSMG和LAP框架，将累积奖励分配给每一步，并采用绝对优势加权采样策略优化训练。

Result: 在Snake和Frozen Lake任务中，3B参数模型表现优于72B基线50%。

Conclusion: 针对性后训练是替代模型规模扩展的高效方法，可提升LLM在序列决策任务中的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential as sequential decision-making
agents, but their application is often limited due to a reliance on large,
computationally expensive models. This creates a need to improve smaller
models, yet existing post-training methods are designed for single-turn
interactions and cannot handle credit assignment in multi-step agentic tasks.
To address this, we introduce Multi-Step Group-Relative Policy Optimization
(MS-GRPO), a new algorithm for post-training LLM agents, grounded in formal
Text-Mediated Stochastic Game (TSMG) and Language-Agent Policy (LAP)
frameworks. For credit assignment, MS-GRPO attributes the entire cumulative
episode reward to each individual episode step. We supplement this algorithm
with a novel absolute-advantage-weighted episode sampling strategy that we show
improves training performance. We evaluate our approach by post-training a
3-billion parameter model on Snake and Frozen Lake. Our experiments demonstrate
that the method is effective in improving decision-making performance: our
post-trained 3B parameter model outperforms a 72B parameter baseline by 50% on
the Frozen Lake task. This work demonstrates that targeted post-training is a
practical and efficient alternative to relying on model scale for creating
sequential decision-making agents using LLMs.

Motivation: 心理健康专业人员短缺，现有心理领域研究多关注情感支持，缺乏推理机制。Psyche-R1旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计数据合成管道生成高质量心理问题和共情对话，采用混合训练策略（GRPO和SFT）提升推理和共情能力。

Abstract: Amidst a shortage of qualified mental health professionals, the integration
of large language models (LLMs) into psychological applications offers a
promising way to alleviate the growing burden of mental health disorders.
Recent reasoning-augmented LLMs have achieved remarkable performance in
mathematics and programming, while research in the psychological domain has
predominantly emphasized emotional support and empathetic dialogue, with
limited attention to reasoning mechanisms that are beneficial to generating
reliable responses. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Psyche-R1, the first
Chinese psychological LLM that jointly integrates empathy, psychological
expertise, and reasoning, built upon a novel data curation pipeline.
Specifically, we design a comprehensive data synthesis pipeline that produces
over 75k high-quality psychological questions paired with detailed rationales,
generated through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and iterative
prompt-rationale optimization, along with 73k empathetic dialogues.
Subsequently, we employ a hybrid training strategy wherein challenging samples
are identified through a multi-LLM cross-selection strategy for group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning ability, while the remaining
data is used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance empathetic response
generation and psychological domain knowledge. Extensive experiment results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the Psyche-R1 across several psychological
benchmarks, where our 7B Psyche-R1 achieves comparable results to 671B
DeepSeek-R1.

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have spurred growing interests in
automated interpreting quality assessment. Nevertheless, existing research
suffers from insufficient examination of language use quality, unsatisfactory
modeling effectiveness due to data scarcity and imbalance, and a lack of
efforts to explain model predictions. To address these gaps, we propose a
multi-dimensional modeling framework that integrates feature engineering, data
augmentation, and explainable machine learning. This approach prioritizes
explainability over ``black box'' predictions by utilizing only
construct-relevant, transparent features and conducting Shapley Value (SHAP)
analysis. Our results demonstrate strong predictive performance on a novel
English-Chinese consecutive interpreting dataset, identifying BLEURT and
CometKiwi scores to be the strongest predictive features for fidelity,
pause-related features for fluency, and Chinese-specific phraseological
diversity metrics for language use. Overall, by placing particular emphasis on
explainability, we present a scalable, reliable, and transparent alternative to
traditional human evaluation, facilitating the provision of detailed diagnostic
feedback for learners and supporting self-regulated learning advantages not
afforded by automated scores in isolation.

Conclusion: LLMs能有效利用内部知识，SSRL减少幻觉并支持无缝集成外部工具，为可扩展的RL训练提供潜力。

Abstract: We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to serve as
efficient simulators for agentic search tasks in reinforcement learning (RL),
thereby reducing dependence on costly interactions with external search
engines. To this end, we first quantify the intrinsic search capability of LLMs
via structured prompting and repeated sampling, which we term Self-Search. Our
results reveal that LLMs exhibit strong scaling behavior with respect to the
inference budget, achieving high pass@k on question-answering benchmarks,
including the challenging BrowseComp task. Building on these observations, we
introduce Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' Self-Search capability
through format-based and rule-based rewards. SSRL enables models to iteratively
refine their knowledge utilization internally, without requiring access to
external tools. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSRL-trained policy
models provide a cost-effective and stable environment for search-driven RL
training, reducing reliance on external search engines and facilitating robust
sim-to-real transfer. We draw the following conclusions: 1) LLMs possess world
knowledge that can be effectively elicited to achieve high performance; 2) SSRL
demonstrates the potential of leveraging internal knowledge to reduce
hallucination; 3) SSRL-trained models integrate seamlessly with external search
engines without additional effort. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs
to support more scalable RL agent training.

Method: 综述DLMs的演变、技术基础、最新模型、预训练策略、后训练方法、推理优化及多模态扩展，并分析其应用场景。

Result: DLMs在性能上接近AR模型，具备并行生成优势，但面临效率、长序列处理等挑战。

Conclusion: DLMs是NLP领域的重要进展，未来需解决效率等问题以进一步推动其应用。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful and
promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm. By
generating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs
possess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing
bidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the
generation process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent
advancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their
autoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various
natural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic
overview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship
with other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and
cover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers
an up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current
techniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods.
Another contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference
strategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism,
caching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest
approaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications
across various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the
limitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence
handling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research
directions to sustain progress in this rapidly evolving field. Project GitHub

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何将多模态大语言模型（mLLMs）应用于B-rep CAD对象的高级编辑任务，提出了B-repLer模型，并通过自动生成数据集和新型架构解决了3D数据稀缺和表示复杂性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管mLLMs在图像和文本任务中表现出色，但在3D分析和编辑任务中表现有限，尤其是B-rep CAD对象，因其数据稀缺和表示复杂性。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出B-repLer模型，通过新型多模态架构处理B-rep数据，并利用现有CAD工具自动生成所需数据集，无需外部标注。

Result: B-repLer能够理解文本提示并对B-rep进行语义编辑，生成有效输出，实现了多种复杂度的文本驱动编辑。

Conclusion: B-repLer展示了mLLMs在B-rep CAD编辑中的潜力，为3D任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (mLLMs), trained in a mixed modal setting as
a universal model, have been shown to compete with or even outperform many
specialized algorithms for imaging and graphics tasks. As demonstrated across
many applications, mLLMs' ability to jointly process image and text data makes
them suitable for zero-shot applications or efficient fine-tuning towards
specialized tasks. However, they have had limited success in 3D analysis and
editing tasks. This is due to both the lack of suitable (annotated) 3D data as
well as the idiosyncrasies of 3D representations. In this paper, we investigate
whether mLLMs can be adapted to support high-level editing of Boundary
Representation (B-rep) CAD objects. B-reps remain the industry-standard for
precisely encoding engineering objects, but are challenging as the
representation is fragile (i.e. can easily lead to invalid CAD objects) and no
publicly available data source exists with semantically-annotated B-reps or CAD
construction history. We present B-repLer as a finetuned mLLM that can
understand text prompts and make semantic edits on given B-Reps to produce
valid outputs. We enable this via a novel multimodal architecture, specifically
designed to handle B-rep models, and demonstrate how existing CAD tools, in
conjunction with mLLMs, can be used to automatically generate the required
reasoning dataset, without relying on external annotations. We extensively
evaluate B-repLer and demonstrate several text-based B-rep edits of various
complexity, which were not previously possible.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于WiFi和OpenStreetMap Area Graph（osmAG）的室内定位框架，通过信号传播建模和几何拓扑先验，显著提高了定位精度和空间效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPS在室内环境中不可用，因此需要一种基于现有无线基础设施的全局定位方法。

Method: 离线阶段通过迭代优化算法定位WiFi接入点（AP），在线阶段利用增强的osmAG地图进行实时机器人定位。

Result: 离线阶段AP定位误差为3.79米（比三边测量提升35.3%），在线阶段定位误差在指纹区为3.12米（比KNN指纹提升8.77%），非指纹区为3.83米（提升81.05%）。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂多楼层环境中验证有效，提供了一种可扩展且经济高效的室内机器人定位解决方案。

Abstract: Global localization is essential for autonomous robotics, especially in
indoor environments where the GPS signal is denied. We propose a novel
WiFi-based localization framework that leverages ubiquitous wireless
infrastructure and the OpenStreetMap Area Graph (osmAG) for large-scale indoor
environments. Our approach integrates signal propagation modeling with osmAG's
geometric and topological priors. In the offline phase, an iterative
optimization algorithm localizes WiFi Access Points (APs) by modeling wall
attenuation, achieving a mean localization error of 3.79 m (35.3\% improvement
over trilateration). In the online phase, real-time robot localization uses the
augmented osmAG map, yielding a mean error of 3.12 m in fingerprinted areas
(8.77\% improvement over KNN fingerprinting) and 3.83 m in non-fingerprinted
areas (81.05\% improvement). Comparison with a fingerprint-based method shows
that our approach is much more space efficient and achieves superior
localization accuracy, especially for positions where no fingerprint data are
available. Validated across a complex 11,025 &m^2& multi-floor environment,
this framework offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for indoor robotic
localization, solving the kidnapped robot problem. The code and dataset are

Method: 采用GCS和ST-GCS框架，通过凸集约束生成无碰撞的最优轨迹，并探索了通用GCS兼容约束的推导方法。

Result: ST-GCS在静态环境中生成与标准GCS等效的轨迹，在动态环境中也能找到最小距离的无碰撞轨迹。

Conclusion: ST-GCS是一种有效的框架，适用于动态环境中的轨迹优化问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we create optimal, collision-free, time-dependent trajectories
through cluttered dynamic environments. The many spatial and temporal
constraints make finding an initial guess for a numerical solver difficult.
Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) and the recently developed Space-Time Graphs of
Convex Sets formulation (ST-GCS) enable us to generate optimal minimum distance
collision-free trajectories without providing an initial guess to the solver.
We also explore the derivation of general GCS-compatible constraints and
document an intuitive strategy for adapting general constraints to the
framework. We show that ST-GCS produces equivalent trajectories to the standard
GCS formulation when the environment is static. We then show ST-GCS operating
in dynamic environments to find minimum distance collision-free trajectories.

Abstract: Robust bipedal locomotion in exoskeletons requires the ability to dynamically

hybrid data-driven predictive control (HDDPC) framework, an extension of the
data-enabled predictive control, that addresses these challenges by
simultaneously planning foot contact schedules and continuous domain
trajectories. The proposed framework utilizes a Hankel matrix-based
representation to model system dynamics, incorporating step-to-step (S2S)
transitions to enhance adaptability in dynamic environments. By integrating
contact scheduling with trajectory planning, the framework offers an efficient,

Result: 实验表明，该方法在仿真和真实场景中均表现出精确操作和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ReconVLA通过隐式接地范式有效提升了VLA模型的视觉注意力分配和任务执行能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled robotic
agents to integrate multimodal understanding with action execution. However,
our empirical analysis reveals that current VLAs struggle to allocate visual
attention to target regions. Instead, visual attention is always dispersed. To
guide the visual attention grounding on the correct target, we propose
ReconVLA, a reconstructive VLA model with an implicit grounding paradigm.
Conditioned on the model's visual outputs, a diffusion transformer aims to
reconstruct the gaze region of the image, which corresponds to the target
manipulated objects. This process prompts the VLA model to learn fine-grained
representations and accurately allocate visual attention, thus effectively
leveraging task-specific visual information and conducting precise
manipulation. Moreover, we curate a large-scale pretraining dataset comprising
over 100k trajectories and 2 million data samples from open-source robotic
datasets, further boosting the model's generalization in visual reconstruction.
Extensive experiments in simulation and the real world demonstrate the
superiority of our implicit grounding method, showcasing its capabilities of
precise manipulation and generalization. Our project page is

Result: 在DARPA SubT和多房间场景中，BEASST路径长度减少15%，源定位速度提升20%。

Conclusion: BEASST通过智能不确定性驱动导航，显著优于现有方法，适用于复杂环境中的高效源搜索。

Abstract: This paper presents BEASST (Behavioral Entropic Gradient-based Adaptive
Source Seeking for Mobile Robots), a novel framework for robotic source seeking
in complex, unknown environments. Our approach enables mobile robots to
efficiently balance exploration and exploitation by modeling normalized signal
strength as a surrogate probability of source location. Building on Behavioral
Entropy(BE) with Prelec's probability weighting function, we define an
objective function that adapts robot behavior from risk-averse to risk-seeking
based on signal reliability and mission urgency. The framework provides
theoretical convergence guarantees under unimodal signal assumptions and
practical stability under bounded disturbances. Experimental validation across
DARPA SubT and multi-room scenarios demonstrates that BEASST consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 15% reduction in path length
and 20% faster source localization through intelligent uncertainty-driven
navigation that dynamically transitions between aggressive pursuit and cautious

Motivation: 在少样本数据场景下，强化学习在多模态人类活动识别领域的应用尚未充分探索，因此研究如何利用视觉强化学习提升模型性能。

Result: 在四个HAR数据集和五种不同设置下的实验表明，该方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: FAVOR方法通过视觉强化学习显著提升了少样本人类活动识别的效果，并增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in large reasoning models enables learning from
feedback on their outputs, making it particularly valuable in scenarios where
fine-tuning data is limited. However, its application in multi-modal human
activity recognition (HAR) domains remains largely underexplored. Our work
extends reinforcement learning to the human activity recognition domain with
multimodal large language models. By incorporating visual reinforcement
learning in the training process, the model's generalization ability on
few-shot recognition can be greatly improved. Additionally, visual
reinforcement learning can enhance the model's reasoning ability and enable
explainable analysis in the inference stage. We name our few-shot human
activity recognition method with visual reinforcement learning FAVOR.
Specifically, our approach first utilizes a multimodal large language model
(MLLM) to generate multiple candidate responses for the human activity image,
each containing reasoning traces and final answers. These responses are then
evaluated using reward functions, and the MLLM model is subsequently optimized
using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. In this way, the
MLLM model can be adapted to human activity recognition with only a few
samples. Extensive experiments on four human activity recognition datasets and
five different settings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 该框架提升了外骨骼的语义适应性和安全性。

Abstract: Upper-limb exoskeletons are primarily designed to provide assistive support
by accurately interpreting and responding to human intentions. In home-care
scenarios, exoskeletons are expected to adapt their assistive configurations
based on the semantic information of the task, adjusting appropriately in
accordance with the nature of the object being manipulated. However, existing
solutions often lack the ability to understand task semantics or
collaboratively plan actions with the user, limiting their generalizability. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces a semantic-aware framework that
integrates large language models into the task planning framework, enabling the
delivery of safe and intent-integrative assistance. The proposed approach
begins with the exoskeleton operating in transparent mode to capture the
wearer's intent during object grasping. Once semantic information is extracted
from the task description, the system automatically configures appropriate
assistive parameters. In addition, a diffusion-based anomaly detector is used
to continuously monitor the state of human-robot interaction and trigger
real-time replanning in response to detected anomalies. During task execution,
online trajectory refinement and impedance control are used to ensure safety
and regulate human-robot interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method effectively aligns with the wearer's cognition, adapts to
semantically varying tasks, and responds reliably to anomalies.

Abstract: Conventionally, human intuition often defines vision as a modality of passive
optical sensing, while active optical sensing is typically regarded as
measuring rather than the default modality of vision. However, the situation
now changes: sensor technologies and data-driven paradigms empower active
optical sensing to redefine the boundaries of vision, ushering in a new era of
active vision. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors capture reflectance
from object surfaces, which remains invariant under varying illumination
conditions, showcasing significant potential in robotic perception tasks such
as detection, recognition, segmentation, and Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM). These applications often rely on dense sensing capabilities,
typically achieved by high-resolution, expensive LiDAR sensors. A key challenge
with low-cost LiDARs lies in the sparsity of scan data, which limits their
broader application. To address this limitation, this work introduces an
innovative framework for generating dense LiDAR reflectance images from sparse
data, leveraging the unique attributes of non-repeating scanning LiDAR
(NRS-LiDAR). We tackle critical challenges, including reflectance calibration
and the transition from static to dynamic scene domains, facilitating the
reconstruction of dense reflectance images in real-world settings. The key
contributions of this work include a comprehensive dataset for LiDAR
reflectance image densification, a densification network tailored for
NRS-LiDAR, and diverse applications such as loop closure and traffic lane
detection using the generated dense reflectance images.

Abstract: Embodied AI aims to develop intelligent systems with physical forms capable
of perceiving, decision-making, acting, and learning in real-world
environments, providing a promising way to Artificial General Intelligence
(AGI). Despite decades of explorations, it remains challenging for embodied
agents to achieve human-level intelligence for general-purpose tasks in open
dynamic environments. Recent breakthroughs in large models have revolutionized
embodied AI by enhancing perception, interaction, planning and learning. In
this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on large model empowered
embodied AI, focusing on autonomous decision-making and embodied learning. We
investigate both hierarchical and end-to-end decision-making paradigms,
detailing how large models enhance high-level planning, low-level execution,
and feedback for hierarchical decision-making, and how large models enhance
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end decision making. For
embodied learning, we introduce mainstream learning methodologies, elaborating
on how large models enhance imitation learning and reinforcement learning
in-depth. For the first time, we integrate world models into the survey of
embodied AI, presenting their design methods and critical roles in enhancing
decision-making and learning. Though solid advances have been achieved,
challenges still exist, which are discussed at the end of this survey,
potentially as the further research directions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Self-correction Flywheel的后训练范式，通过利用模型的错误轨迹生成自校正数据，逐步提升视觉语言导航模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言导航模型在执行指令时容易偏离正确轨迹，且缺乏有效的错误校正能力。

Method: 提出Self-correction Flywheel范式，将错误轨迹视为有价值的数据源，自动生成自校正数据用于持续训练。

Result: 在R2R-CE和RxR-CE基准测试中，CorrectNav模型分别达到65.1%和69.3%的成功率，优于之前的最佳模型。

Conclusion: Self-correction Flywheel范式显著提升了模型的错误校正能力和性能，适用于动态障碍物避障和长指令跟随。

Abstract: Existing vision-and-language navigation models often deviate from the correct
trajectory when executing instructions. However, these models lack effective
error correction capability, hindering their recovery from errors. To address
this challenge, we propose Self-correction Flywheel, a novel post-training
paradigm. Instead of considering the model's error trajectories on the training
set as a drawback, our paradigm emphasizes their significance as a valuable
data source. We have developed a method to identify deviations in these error
trajectories and devised innovative techniques to automatically generate
self-correction data for perception and action. These self-correction data
serve as fuel to power the model's continued training. The brilliance of our
paradigm is revealed when we re-evaluate the model on the training set,
uncovering new error trajectories. At this time, the self-correction flywheel
begins to spin. Through multiple flywheel iterations, we progressively enhance
our monocular RGB-based VLA navigation model CorrectNav. Experiments on R2R-CE
and RxR-CE benchmarks show CorrectNav achieves new state-of-the-art success
rates of 65.1% and 69.3%, surpassing prior best VLA navigation models by 8.2%
and 16.4%. Real robot tests in various indoor and outdoor environments
demonstrate \method's superior capability of error correction, dynamic obstacle
avoidance, and long instruction following.

Motivation: 现有方法通常采用单智能体强化学习或多智能体强化学习用于多机器人系统，而本研究探索了将协作异构MARL应用于单个人形机器人运动优化的新范式。

Method: 提出MASH方法，将机器人的每个肢体（腿和手臂）视为独立智能体，通过共享全局批评器进行协作学习，优化运动策略。

Result: 实验表明，MASH加速了训练收敛，提升了全身协作能力，优于传统单智能体强化学习方法。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了MARL在单个人形机器人控制中的应用，为高效运动策略提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method to enhance locomotion for a single
humanoid robot through cooperative-heterogeneous multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning (MARL). While most existing methods typically employ single-agent
reinforcement learning algorithms for a single humanoid robot or MARL
algorithms for multi-robot system tasks, we propose a distinct paradigm:
applying cooperative-heterogeneous MARL to optimize locomotion for a single
humanoid robot. The proposed method, multi-agent reinforcement learning for
single humanoid locomotion (MASH), treats each limb (legs and arms) as an
independent agent that explores the robot's action space while sharing a global
critic for cooperative learning. Experiments demonstrate that MASH accelerates
training convergence and improves whole-body cooperation ability, outperforming
conventional single-agent reinforcement learning methods. This work advances
the integration of MARL into single-humanoid-robot control, offering new
insights into efficient locomotion strategies.

Conclusion: 该框架有效降低了部署机器人系统的复杂性。

Abstract: Developing robotic algorithms and integrating a robotic subsystem into a
larger system can be a difficult task. Particularly in small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) where robotics expertise is lacking, implementing,
maintaining and developing robotic systems can be a challenge. As a result,
many companies rely on external expertise through system integrators, which, in
some cases, can lead to vendor lock-in and external dependency. In the academic
research on intelligent manufacturing systems, robots play a critical role in
the design of robust autonomous systems. Similar challenges are faced by
researchers who want to use robotic systems as a component in a larger smart
system, without having to deal with the complexity and vastness of the robot
interfaces in detail. In this paper, we propose a software framework that
reduces the effort required to deploy a working robotic system. The focus is
solely on providing a concept for simplifying the different interfaces of a
modern robot system and using an abstraction layer for different manufacturers
and models. The Python programming language is used to implement a prototype of
the concept. The target system is a bin-picking cell containing a Yaskawa
Motoman GP4.

*Andrea Rosasco,Federico Ceola,Giulia Pasquale,Lorenzo Natale*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: KDPE提出了一种基于核密度估计的策略，用于过滤Diffusion Policy生成的有害轨迹，同时保持低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Diffusion Policy在机器人行为克隆中的两个主要缺点：去噪过程的随机性可能影响动作轨迹质量，以及监督学习可能学习到数据中的异常值。

Method: 使用核密度估计（KDE）和流形感知核，对动作（包括末端执行器的笛卡尔位置、方向和夹爪状态）建模概率密度函数，过滤有害轨迹。

Result: KDPE在模拟单臂任务和真实机器人实验中表现优于Diffusion Policy。

Conclusion: KDPE通过核密度估计有效提升了Diffusion Policy的性能，同时保持了低计算开销。

Abstract: Learning robot policies that capture multimodality in the training data has
been a long-standing open challenge for behavior cloning. Recent approaches
tackle the problem by modeling the conditional action distribution with
generative models. One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on
a diffusion model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories.
While achieving state-of-the-art performance, it has two main drawbacks that
may lead the robot out of the data distribution during policy execution. First,
the stochasticity of the denoising process can highly impact on the quality of
generated trajectory of actions. Second, being a supervised learning approach,
it can learn data outliers from the dataset used for training. Recent work
focuses on mitigating these limitations by combining Diffusion Policy either
with large-scale training or with classical behavior cloning algorithms.
Instead, we propose KDPE, a Kernel Density Estimation-based strategy that
filters out potentially harmful trajectories output of Diffusion Policy while
keeping a low test-time computational overhead. For Kernel Density Estimation,
we propose a manifold-aware kernel to model a probability density function for
actions composed of end-effector Cartesian position, orientation, and gripper
state. KDPE overall achieves better performance than Diffusion Policy on
simulated single-arm tasks and real robot experiments.

Result: 仿真和真实实验中验证了方法的有效性，实现了多任务执行的零样本迁移。

Conclusion: MLM框架在多任务全身定位操作中表现出色，适用于真实部署。

Abstract: Whole-body loco-manipulation for quadruped robots with arm remains a
challenging problem, particularly in achieving multi-task control. To address
this, we propose MLM, a reinforcement learning framework driven by both
real-world and simulation data. It enables a six-DoF robotic arm--equipped
quadruped robot to perform whole-body loco-manipulation for multiple tasks
autonomously or under human teleoperation. To address the problem of balancing
multiple tasks during the learning of loco-manipulation, we introduce a
trajectory library with an adaptive, curriculum-based sampling mechanism. This
approach allows the policy to efficiently leverage real-world collected
trajectories for learning multi-task loco-manipulation. To address deployment
scenarios with only historical observations and to enhance the performance of
policy execution across tasks with different spatial ranges, we propose a
Trajectory-Velocity Prediction policy network. It predicts unobservable future
trajectories and velocities. By leveraging extensive simulation data and
curriculum-based rewards, our controller achieves whole-body behaviors in
simulation and zero-shot transfer to real-world deployment. Ablation studies in
simulation verify the necessity and effectiveness of our approach, while
real-world experiments on the Go2 robot with an Airbot robotic arm demonstrate
the policy's good performance in multi-task execution.

TL;DR: 论文提出使用民族志小故事（vignettes）来揭示人机交互（HRI）中的失败案例，弥补现有研究的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs提升了人机交互质量，但与人人交互相比仍存在不足，且失败案例因情境而异，难以泛化。

Method: 提出通过撰写民族志小故事的方法，记录多学科视角下的失败案例，增强透明度和意外行为记录。

Result: 小故事能有效揭示罕见失败案例，促进对机器人能力的透明认识，并补充现有评估方法。

Conclusion: 鼓励使用小故事作为现有交互评估方法的补充，以更全面地理解HRI中的问题。

Abstract: Although the quality of human-robot interactions has improved with the advent
of LLMs, there are still various factors that cause systems to be sub-optimal
when compared to human-human interactions. The nature and criticality of
failures are often dependent on the context of the interaction and so cannot be
generalized across the wide range of scenarios and experiments which have been
implemented in HRI research. In this work we propose the use of a technique
overlooked in the field of HRI, ethnographic vignettes, to clearly highlight
these failures, particularly those that are rarely documented. We describe the
methodology behind the process of writing vignettes and create our own based on
our personal experiences with failures in HRI systems. We emphasize the
strength of vignettes as the ability to communicate failures from a
multi-disciplinary perspective, promote transparency about the capabilities of
robots, and document unexpected behaviours which would otherwise be omitted
from research reports. We encourage the use of vignettes to augment existing
interaction evaluation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重型轮式移动机器人（WMRs）在严格国际标准下运行，容易受到故障和干扰，黑盒方法（如DNN）的部署存在挑战。

Method: 设计了分层控制策略，包括DNN作为主控策略和RAC作为低层安全层，高层安全层监控系统性能。

Result: 实验验证了策略在6000 kg WMR上的有效性，确保系统稳定性和安全性。

Conclusion: 结合DNN和RAC的策略在保证稳定性的同时，满足了安全标准。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) can enable precise control while maintaining low
computational costs by circumventing the need for dynamic modeling. However,
the deployment of such black-box approaches remains challenging for heavy-duty
wheeled mobile robots (WMRs), which are subject to strict international
standards and prone to faults and disturbances. We designed a hierarchical
control policy for heavy-duty WMRs, monitored by two safety layers with
differing levels of authority. To this end, a DNN policy was trained and
deployed as the primary control strategy, providing high-precision performance
under nominal operating conditions. When external disturbances arise and reach
a level of intensity such that the system performance falls below a predefined
threshold, a low-level safety layer intervenes by deactivating the primary
control policy and activating a model-free robust adaptive control (RAC)
policy. This transition enables the system to continue operating while ensuring
stability by effectively managing the inherent trade-off between system
robustness and responsiveness. Regardless of the control policy in use, a
high-level safety layer continuously monitors system performance during
operation. It initiates a shutdown only when disturbances become sufficiently
severe such that compensation is no longer viable and continued operation would
jeopardize the system or its environment. The proposed synthesis of DNN and RAC
policy guarantees uniform exponential stability of the entire WMR system while
adhering to safety standards to some extent. The effectiveness of the proposed
approach was further validated through real-time experiments using a 6,000 kg
WMR.

Abstract: Soft robots, particularly magnetic soft robots, require specialized
simulation tools to accurately model their deformation under external magnetic
fields. However, existing platforms often lack dedicated support for magnetic
materials, making them difficult to use for researchers at different expertise
levels. This work introduces an open-source, user-friendly simulation interface
using the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA), specifically designed
to model magnetic soft robots. The tool enables users to define material
properties, apply magnetic fields, and observe resulting deformations in real
time. By integrating intuitive controls and stress analysis capabilities, it
aims to bridge the gap between theoretical modeling and practical design. Four
benchmark models - a beam, three- and four-finger grippers, and a butterfly -
demonstrate its functionality. The software's ease of use makes it accessible
to both beginners and advanced researchers. Future improvements will refine
accuracy through experimental validation and comparison with industry-standard
finite element solvers, ensuring realistic and predictive simulations of
magnetic soft robots.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能显著影响机器人的探索行为，提高探索效率。

Conclusion: 通过引入显著性区域的概念，可以更高效地指导机器人探索未知环境。

Abstract: Autonomous exploration is a widely studied problem where a robot
incrementally builds a map of a previously unknown environment. The robot
selects the next locations to reach using an exploration strategy. To do so,
the robot has to balance between competing objectives, like exploring the
entirety of the environment, while being as fast as possible. Most exploration
strategies try to maximise the explored area to speed up exploration; however,
they do not consider that parts of the environment are more important than
others, as they lead to the discovery of large unknown areas. We propose a
method that identifies \emph{saliency areas} as those areas that are of high
interest for exploration, by using saliency maps obtained from a neural network
that, given the current map, implements a termination criterion to estimate
whether the environment can be considered fully-explored or not. We use
saliency areas to bias some widely used exploration strategies, showing, with
an extensive experimental campaign, that this knowledge can significantly
influence the behavior of the robot during exploration.

Abstract: Modern robotic systems, such as mobile manipulators, humanoids, and aerial
robots with arms, often possess high redundancy, enabling them to perform
multiple tasks simultaneously. Managing this redundancy is key to achieving
reliable and flexible behavior. A widely used approach is the Stack of Tasks
(SoT), which organizes control objectives by priority within a unified
framework. However, traditional SoTs are manually designed by experts, limiting
their adaptability and accessibility. This paper introduces a novel framework
that automatically learns both the hierarchy and parameters of a SoT from
user-defined objectives. By combining Reinforcement Learning and Genetic
Programming, the system discovers task priorities and control strategies
without manual intervention. A cost function based on intuitive metrics such as
precision, safety, and execution time guides the learning process. We validate
our method through simulations and experiments on the mobile-YuMi platform, a
dual-arm mobile manipulator with high redundancy. Results show that the learned
SoTs enable the robot to dynamically adapt to changing environments and inputs,
balancing competing objectives while maintaining robust task execution. This
approach provides a general and user-friendly solution for redundancy
management in complex robots, advancing human-centered robot programming and
reducing the need for expert design.

Conclusion: SET框架有助于提升自主系统的安全性和公众信任。

Abstract: Future autonomous systems promise significant societal benefits, yet their
deployment raises concerns about safety and trustworthiness. A key concern is
assuring the reliability of robot perception, as perception seeds safe
decision-making. Failures in perception are often due to complex yet common
environmental factors and can lead to accidents that erode public trust. To
address this concern, we introduce the SET (Self, Environment, and Target)
Perceptual Factors Framework. We designed the framework to systematically
analyze how factors such as weather, occlusion, or sensor limitations
negatively impact perception. To achieve this, the framework employs SET State
Trees to categorize where such factors originate and SET Factor Trees to model
how these sources and factors impact perceptual tasks like object detection or
pose estimation. Next, we develop Perceptual Factor Models using both trees to
quantify the uncertainty for a given task. Our framework aims to promote
rigorous safety assurances and cultivate greater public understanding and trust
in autonomous systems by offering a transparent and standardized method for
identifying, modeling, and communicating perceptual risks.

Motivation: 主观自我披露是人类社交互动的重要特征，但目前缺乏计算模型来准确模拟这一行为，尤其是在人类与机器人互动中的表现。随着社交机器人在各种社交场景中的应用需求增加，这一研究变得尤为重要。

Method: 开发了一种基于情感识别文献的多模态注意力网络模型，使用大规模自收集的自我披露视频语料库进行训练，并提出了新的尺度保持交叉熵损失函数。

Result: 最佳模型在新损失函数下的F1得分为0.83，比基线模型提高了0.48。

Conclusion: 该研究为社交机器人识别互动伙伴的自我披露行为提供了重要进展，这对具有社交认知能力的机器人至关重要。

Abstract: Subjective self-disclosure is an important feature of human social
interaction. While much has been done in the social and behavioural literature
to characterise the features and consequences of subjective self-disclosure,
little work has been done thus far to develop computational systems that are
able to accurately model it. Even less work has been done that attempts to
model specifically how human interactants self-disclose with robotic partners.
It is becoming more pressing as we require social robots to work in conjunction
with and establish relationships with humans in various social settings. In
this paper, our aim is to develop a custom multimodal attention network based
on models from the emotion recognition literature, training this model on a
large self-collected self-disclosure video corpus, and constructing a new loss
function, the scale preserving cross entropy loss, that improves upon both
classification and regression versions of this problem. Our results show that
the best performing model, trained with our novel loss function, achieves an F1
score of 0.83, an improvement of 0.48 from the best baseline model. This result
makes significant headway in the aim of allowing social robots to pick up on an
interaction partner's self-disclosures, an ability that will be essential in
social robots with social cognition.

Result: 理论证明CVIRO能自然保持系统正确的不可观测子空间，实验表明其定位精度和一致性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CVIRO通过联合估计和可观测一致性设计，显著提升了UWB辅助VIO系统的定位性能。

Abstract: Ultra Wideband (UWB) is widely used to mitigate drift in visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) systems. Consistency is crucial for ensuring the estimation
accuracy of a UWBaided VIO system. An inconsistent estimator can degrade
localization performance, where the inconsistency primarily arises from two
main factors: (1) the estimator fails to preserve the correct system
observability, and (2) UWB anchor positions are assumed to be known, leading to
improper neglect of calibration uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a
consistent and tightly-coupled visual-inertial-ranging odometry (CVIRO) system
based on the Lie group. Our method incorporates the UWB anchor state into the
system state, explicitly accounting for UWB calibration uncertainty and
enabling the joint and consistent estimation of both robot and anchor states.
Furthermore, observability consistency is ensured by leveraging the invariant
error properties of the Lie group. We analytically prove that the CVIRO
algorithm naturally maintains the system's correct unobservable subspace,
thereby preserving estimation consistency. Extensive simulations and
experiments demonstrate that CVIRO achieves superior localization accuracy and
consistency compared to existing methods.

Motivation: 低地球轨道日益拥挤，导致卫星部署和运行面临碰撞风险增加的问题，需要一种高效的方法优化轨道参数以满足任务需求。

Method: 采用Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)算法，将问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），在自定义的OpenAI Gymnasium环境中模拟轨道动力学，调整五个轨道参数以实现目标覆盖。

Result: A2C在累积奖励（10.0 vs 9.263025）和收敛速度（2,000 vs 63,000时间步）上优于PPO，且能高效满足任务目标。

Conclusion: 强化学习为低地球轨道任务规划提供了一种计算高效且可扩展的解决方案，特别适用于实时任务规划。

Abstract: The increasing congestion of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) poses persistent
challenges to the efficient deployment and safe operation of Earth observation
satellites. Mission planners must now account not only for mission-specific
requirements but also for the increasing collision risk with active satellites
and space debris. This work presents a reinforcement learning framework using
the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to optimize satellite orbital
parameters for precise terrestrial coverage within predefined surface radii. By
formulating the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a custom
OpenAI Gymnasium environment, our method simulates orbital dynamics using
classical Keplerian elements. The agent progressively learns to adjust five of
the orbital parameters - semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right
ascension of ascending node, and the argument of perigee-to achieve targeted
terrestrial coverage. Comparative evaluation against Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) demonstrates A2C's superior performance, achieving 5.8x
higher cumulative rewards (10.0 vs 9.263025) while converging in 31.5x fewer
timesteps (2,000 vs 63,000). The A2C agent consistently meets mission
objectives across diverse target coordinates while maintaining computational
efficiency suitable for real-time mission planning applications. Key
contributions include: (1) a TLE-based orbital simulation environment
incorporating physics constraints, (2) validation of actor-critic methods'
superiority over trust region approaches in continuous orbital control, and (3)
demonstration of rapid convergence enabling adaptive satellite deployment. This
approach establishes reinforcement learning as a computationally efficient
alternative for scalable and intelligent LEO mission planning.

Abstract: The large spread of disinformation across digital platforms creates
significant challenges to information integrity. This paper presents a
multi-agent system that uses relation extraction to detect disinformation in
news articles, focusing on titles and short text snippets. The proposed Agentic
AI system combines four agents: (i) a machine learning agent (logistic
regression), (ii) a Wikipedia knowledge check agent (which relies on named
entity recognition), (iii) a coherence detection agent (using LLM prompt
engineering), and (iv) a web-scraped data analyzer that extracts relational
triplets for fact checking. The system is orchestrated via the Model Context
Protocol (MCP), offering shared context and live learning across components.
Results demonstrate that the multi-agent ensemble achieves 95.3% accuracy with
an F1 score of 0.964, significantly outperforming individual agents and
traditional approaches. The weighted aggregation method, mathematically derived
from individual agent misclassification rates, proves superior to algorithmic
threshold optimization. The modular architecture makes the system easily

Motivation: 当前深度研究代理（DRAs）多为闭源系统，缺乏开源选项。本文旨在评估开源ODR的性能，并通过改进提升其表现。

Method: 使用BrowseComp-Small基准测试ODR及闭源系统，提出三项改进策略，构建ODR+模型。

Result: 初始测试中所有系统准确率为0%，改进后的ODR+达到10%成功率。

Conclusion: 开源ODR+在基准测试中表现优于闭源系统，验证了改进策略的有效性。

Abstract: We focus here on Deep Research Agents (DRAs), which are systems that can take
a natural language prompt from a user, and then autonomously search for, and
utilize, internet-based content to address the prompt. Recent DRAs have
demonstrated impressive capabilities on public benchmarks however, recent
research largely involves proprietary closed-source systems. At the time of
this work, we only found one open-source DRA, termed Open Deep Research (ODR).
In this work we adapt the challenging recent BrowseComp benchmark to compare
ODR to existing proprietary systems. We propose BrowseComp-Small (BC-Small),
comprising a subset of BrowseComp, as a more computationally-tractable DRA
benchmark for academic labs. We benchmark ODR and two other proprietary systems
on BC-Small: one system from Anthropic and one system from Google. We find that
all three systems achieve 0% accuracy on the test set of 60 questions. We
introduce three strategic improvements to ODR, resulting in the ODR+ model,
which achieves a state-of-the-art 10% success rate on BC-Small among both
closed-source and open-source systems. We report ablation studies indicating
that all three of our improvements contributed to the success of ODR+.

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）的长链推理输出增加了计算成本并可能导致过度思考，需平衡推理效果与效率。

Method: 分析生成路径分布并通过难度估计过滤轨迹，提出LCPO方法，基于Bradley-Terry损失框架优化偏好。

Result: 实验表明，LCPO在多个基准测试中将平均输出长度减少50%以上，同时保持推理性能。

Conclusion: LCPO展示了在有限数据和训练下高效引导LRMs进行推理的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on complex tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.
However, their lengthy outputs increase computational costs and may lead to
overthinking, raising challenges in balancing reasoning effectiveness and
efficiency. Current methods for efficient reasoning often compromise reasoning
quality or require extensive resources. This paper investigates efficient
methods to reduce the generation length of LRMs. We analyze generation path
distributions and filter generated trajectories through difficulty estimation.
Subsequently, we analyze the convergence behaviors of the objectives of various
preference optimization methods under a Bradley-Terry loss based framework.
Based on the analysis, we propose Length Controlled Preference Optimization
(LCPO) that directly balances the implicit reward related to NLL loss. LCPO can
effectively learn length preference with limited data and training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the average
output length by over 50\% across multiple benchmarks while maintaining the
reasoning performance. Our work highlights the potential for computationally
efficient approaches in guiding LRMs toward efficient reasoning.

Result: KompeteAI在AutoML基准测试MLE-Bench上平均优于其他方法3%，并将管道评估速度提升6.9倍。

Conclusion: KompeteAI通过创新方法显著提升了AutoML系统的性能和效率，并提出了新的基准测试Kompete-bench。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based AutoML systems demonstrate impressive
capabilities but face significant limitations such as constrained exploration
strategies and a severe execution bottleneck. Exploration is hindered by
one-shot methods lacking diversity and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
approaches that fail to recombine strong partial solutions. The execution
bottleneck arises from lengthy code validation cycles that stifle iterative
refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce KompeteAI, a novel
AutoML framework with dynamic solution space exploration. Unlike previous MCTS
methods that treat ideas in isolation, KompeteAI introduces a merging stage
that composes top candidates. We further expand the hypothesis space by
integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), sourcing ideas from Kaggle
notebooks and arXiv papers to incorporate real-world strategies. KompeteAI also
addresses the execution bottleneck via a predictive scoring model and an
accelerated debugging method, assessing solution potential using early stage
metrics to avoid costly full-code execution. This approach accelerates pipeline
evaluation 6.9 times. KompeteAI outperforms leading methods (e.g., RD-agent,
AIDE, and Ml-Master) by an average of 3\% on the primary AutoML benchmark,
MLE-Bench. Additionally, we propose Kompete-bench to address limitations in
MLE-Bench, where KompeteAI also achieves state-of-the-art results

Result: 该框架在策略评估、内在奖励设计、可解释AI和异常检测中展示了潜力。

Conclusion: 熵势框架为AI中的不确定性管理提供了理论基础，兼具可解释性和多功能性。

Abstract: This work demonstrates how the concept of the entropic potential of events --
a parameter quantifying the influence of discrete events on the expected future
entropy of a system -- can enhance uncertainty quantification, decision-making,
and interpretability in artificial intelligence (AI). Building on its original
formulation in physics, the framework is adapted for AI by introducing an
event-centric measure that captures how actions, observations, or other
discrete occurrences impact uncertainty at future time horizons. Both the
original and AI-adjusted definitions of entropic potential are formalized, with
the latter emphasizing conditional expectations to account for counterfactual
scenarios. Applications are explored in policy evaluation, intrinsic reward
design, explainable AI, and anomaly detection, highlighting the metric's
potential to unify and strengthen uncertainty modeling in intelligent systems.
Conceptual examples illustrate its use in reinforcement learning, Bayesian
inference, and anomaly detection, while practical considerations for
computation in complex AI models are discussed. The entropic potential
framework offers a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and versatile
approach to managing uncertainty in AI, bridging principles from
thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于规则的可验证逐步奖励机制（VSRM），通过奖励有效推理步骤并惩罚无效步骤，解决了大型推理模型（LRMs）在简单问题上过度思考的问题，显著提高了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但存在过度思考问题，即在简单问题上耗费过多计算资源，降低效率。现有方法需要预设任务评估，限制了灵活性和可靠性。

Method: 提出VSRM机制，基于推理轨迹中中间状态的表现分配奖励，与逐步推理任务的自然特性契合。实验在数学推理基准（AIME24和AIME25）上结合PPO和Reinforce++进行验证。

Result: VSRM显著减少了输出长度，同时保持了原始推理性能，平衡了效率与准确性。训练后过度思考频率降低，pass@k分数提升，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: VSRM通过奖励有效步骤和惩罚无效步骤，从根本上缓解了过度思考问题，为高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
complex reasoning tasks, aided by reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards. However, LRMs often suffer from overthinking, expending excessive
computation on simple problems and reducing efficiency. Existing efficient
reasoning methods typically require accurate task assessment to preset token
budgets or select reasoning modes, which limits their flexibility and
reliability. In this work, we revisit the essence of overthinking and identify
that encouraging effective steps while penalizing ineffective ones is key to
its solution. To this end, we propose a novel rule-based verifiable stepwise
reward mechanism (VSRM), which assigns rewards based on the performance of
intermediate states in the reasoning trajectory. This approach is intuitive and
naturally fits the step-by-step nature of reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive
experiments on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24 and
AIME25, by integrating VSRM with PPO and Reinforce++. Results show that our
method achieves substantial output length reduction while maintaining original
reasoning performance, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and
accuracy. Further analysis of overthinking frequency and pass@k score before
and after training demonstrates that our approach in deed effectively
suppresses ineffective steps and encourages effective reasoning, fundamentally
alleviating the overthinking problem. All code will be released upon
acceptance.

Motivation: 传统HATRPO为所有智能体分配相同KL阈值，导致更新缓慢和局部最优，尤其在异构环境中。

Method: 提出HATRPO-W（基于KKT优化全局KL约束）和HATRPO-G（基于贪婪算法优先改进比率），动态分配KL阈值。

Result: 实验显示HATRPO-W和HATRPO-G性能提升超过22.5%，HATRPO-W学习更稳定。

Conclusion: 动态KL阈值分配显著提升了异构多智能体强化学习的效率和效果。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordinated and stable
policy updates among interacting agents. Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region
Policy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each
agent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates,
especially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose
two approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:
HATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes
threshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy
algorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By
connecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold
scheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in
heterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods
significantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and
higher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks. Specifically, HATRPO-W and
HATRPO-G achieve comparable improvements in final performance, each exceeding
22.5%. Notably, HATRPO-W also demonstrates more stable learning dynamics, as
reflected by its lower variance.

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for imaginative
reasoning--the proactive construction, testing, and revision of hypotheses in
information-sparse environments. Existing benchmarks, often static or focused
on social deduction, fail to capture the dynamic, exploratory nature of this
reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive research
framework based on the classic "Turtle Soup" game, integrating a benchmark, an
agent, and an evaluation protocol. We present TurtleSoup-Bench, the first
large-scale, bilingual, interactive benchmark for imaginative reasoning,
comprising 800 turtle soup puzzles sourced from both the Internet and expert
authors. We also propose Mosaic-Agent, a novel agent designed to assess LLMs'
performance in this setting. To evaluate reasoning quality, we develop a
multi-dimensional protocol measuring logical consistency, detail completion,
and conclusion alignment. Experiments with leading LLMs reveal clear capability
limits, common failure patterns, and a significant performance gap compared to
humans. Our work offers new insights into LLMs' imaginative reasoning and
establishes a foundation for future research on exploratory agent behavior.

Result: 在四个QA基准测试中，LeanRAG显著优于现有方法，响应质量提升，检索冗余减少46%。

Conclusion: LeanRAG通过优化语义网络和检索策略，显著提升了RAG的效果和效率。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in grounding Large
Language Models by leveraging external knowledge, whereas the effectiveness is
often compromised by the retrieval of contextually flawed or incomplete
information. To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved
towards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level
summaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,
unaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected
``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community
reasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often
degenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's
rich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework
that features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and
retrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation
algorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations
among aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.
Then, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the
most relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the
graph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive
evidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated
with path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.
Extensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains
demonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in
response quality while reducing 46\% retrieval redundancy. Code is available

Conclusion: HiRef通过结合领域知识和数据驱动方法，显著提升了药物推荐系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task for assisting physicians in
making timely decisions from longitudinal patient medical records. However,
real-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of
rarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully
capture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on
longitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical
performance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions,
largely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address
these issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for
Robust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two
complementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated
medical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from
real-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which
naturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer
through shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.
To further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse
regularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing
spurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model
achieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and
maintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive
experiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience
to unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned
sparsified graph structure and medical code embeddings.

Conclusion: We-Math 2.0 显著提升了数学推理能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and
method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive
knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper,
we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured
mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance
the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math
2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level
hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental
principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a
dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual
expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and
generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a
challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a
two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the
model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive
Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to
achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with
diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that
MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used
benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising
generalization in mathematical reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术知识图谱问答任务复杂，LLM生成的SPARQL查询存在结构和语义错误，需改进。

Method: 提出FIRESPARQL框架，结合微调LLM、RAG和查询修正层，评估多种配置。

Result: 微调方法表现最佳，ROUGE-L达0.90，RelaxedEM达0.85。

Conclusion: FIRESPARQL框架有效提升学术知识图谱问答的查询生成准确性。

Abstract: Question answering over Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) remains a
challenging task due to the complexity of scholarly content and the intricate
structure of these graphs. Large Language Model (LLM) approaches could be used
to translate natural language questions (NLQs) into SPARQL queries; however,
these LLM-based approaches struggle with SPARQL query generation due to limited
exposure to SKG-specific content and the underlying schema. We identified two
main types of errors in the LLM-generated SPARQL queries: (i) structural
inconsistencies, such as missing or redundant triples in the queries, and (ii)
semantic inaccuracies, where incorrect entities or properties are shown in the
queries despite a correct query structure. To address these issues, we propose
FIRESPARQL, a modular framework that supports fine-tuned LLMs as a core
component, with optional context provided via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) and a SPARQL query correction layer. We evaluate the framework on the
SciQA Benchmark using various configurations (zero-shot, zero-shot with RAG,
one-shot, fine-tuning, and fine-tuning with RAG) and compare the performance
with baseline and state-of-the-art approaches. We measure query accuracy using
BLEU and ROUGE metrics, and query result accuracy using relaxed exact
match(RelaxedEM), with respect to the gold standards containing the NLQs,
SPARQL queries, and the results of the queries. Experimental results
demonstrate that fine-tuning achieves the highest overall performance, reaching
0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy on the
test set.

Method: 引入SEQ-GPT系统，利用LLM的语言能力实现自然语言交互，并提出一种LLM适配流程，通过对话合成和多模型协作将自然语言与结构化空间数据对齐。

Result: SEQ-GPT展示了在真实数据和场景中扩展空间搜索的端到端解决方案。

Conclusion: SEQ-GPT通过LLM增强了空间查询的交互性和灵活性，为复杂空间搜索任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Contemporary spatial services such as online maps predominantly rely on user
queries for location searches. However, the user experience is limited when
performing complex tasks, such as searching for a group of locations
simultaneously. In this study, we examine the extended scenario known as
Spatial Exemplar Query (SEQ), where multiple relevant locations are jointly
searched based on user-specified examples. We introduce SEQ-GPT, a spatial
query system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) towards more versatile SEQ
search using natural language. The language capabilities of LLMs enable unique
interactive operations in the SEQ process, including asking users to clarify
query details and dynamically adjusting the search based on user feedback. We
also propose a tailored LLM adaptation pipeline that aligns natural language
with structured spatial data and queries through dialogue synthesis and
multi-model cooperation. SEQ-GPT offers an end-to-end demonstration for
broadening spatial search with realistic data and application scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在临床诊断中仅作为辅助工具，无法主导全流程诊断，限制了其减轻医生负担和提升效率的潜力。

Method: 提出DxDirector-7B，一种具备深度思考能力的LLM，能主导诊断流程并建立责任框架。

Result: DxDirector-7B在罕见、复杂和真实病例中表现优异，显著优于现有医疗LLM和通用LLM。

Conclusion: DxDirector-7B标志着AI从辅助工具转变为诊断主导者，为高效精准诊断开辟新时代。

Abstract: Full-process clinical diagnosis in the real world encompasses the entire
diagnostic workflow that begins with only an ambiguous chief complaint. While
artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is
transforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to
physicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific
medical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the
ability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous
complaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's
ability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship
between physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with
physicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM
endowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the
full-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore,
DxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses,
delineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations
across rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis
setting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic
accuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than
state-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained
analyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,
with expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable
substitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI,
traditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process
to drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and
accurate diagnostic solution.

Motivation: 现有工具增强的代理系统在现实世界中存在黑盒推理、多模态整合不足和效率低下的问题，限制了其在医疗任务中的应用。

Method: PASS通过自适应采样工具图，生成带概率注释的决策路径，并结合三阶段训练优化性能与成本平衡。

Result: 实验表明PASS在多个指标上显著优于基线模型，同时平衡计算成本。

Conclusion: PASS为医疗AI系统提供了可解释、自适应和多模态的新范式。

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented agentic systems are limited in the real world by (i)
black-box reasoning steps that undermine trust of decision-making and pose
safety risks, (ii) poor multimodal integration, which is inherently critical
for healthcare tasks, and (iii) rigid and computationally inefficient agentic
pipelines. We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the
first multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest
X-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a
multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable
probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical
data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic
supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet
layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and
directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient
findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding
whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To
optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel
three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive
path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous
evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step,
safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning. Experiments across various benchmarks
validate that PASS significantly outperforms strong baselines in multiple
metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, LLM-J.) while balancing computational costs,
pushing a new paradigm shift towards interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal
medical agentic systems.

Motivation: 语言模型对齐人类偏好对构建可靠AI系统至关重要，但现有方法（如DPO）在动态和静态偏好数据上的效果差异显著，需进一步研究。

Method: 提出对齐阶段假设，将对齐过程分为偏好注入（需多样性数据）和偏好微调（需高质量数据）两阶段，并设计算法识别阶段边界。

Result: 实验表明，动态和静态数据对不同模型效果差异显著（如Llama-3效果提升3倍，Zephyr降低0.4倍），验证了假设的普适性。

Conclusion: 对齐阶段假设为LM对齐提供了新视角，通过分阶段优化可显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: The alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences is critical for
building reliable AI systems. The problem is typically framed as optimizing an
LM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences.
Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment
method that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and
further improved by incorporating on-policy sampling (i.e., preference
candidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment.
However, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic
effectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference
candidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a 3$\times$ effectiveness
compared with static data for Llama-3, and a 0.4$\times$ effectiveness for
Zephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption,
which divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference
injection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference
fine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and
empirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective
algorithm to identify the boundaries between them. We perform experiments on 5
models (Llama, Zephyr, Phi-2, Qwen, Pythia) and 2 alignment methods (DPO,
SLiC-HF) to show the generalizability of alignment stage assumption and
boundary measurement.

Method: 提出ComMCS方法，通过线性组合当前和后续步骤的蒙特卡洛估计器构建无偏估计器，降低方差且不增加计算成本。

Result: 在MATH-500和GSM8K基准测试中，ComMCS显著优于回归优化方法和非方差缩减基线，分别提升2.8和2.2分。

Conclusion: ComMCS通过减少方差有效提升推理能力，为改进大语言模型的复杂任务表现提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex
domains like mathematics, remain a significant challenge. Value-based process
verifiers, which estimate the probability of a partial reasoning chain leading
to a correct solution, are a promising approach for improving reasoning.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness is often hindered by estimation error in
their training annotations, a consequence of the limited number of Monte Carlo
(MC) samples feasible due to the high cost of LLM inference. In this paper, we
identify that the estimation error primarily arises from high variance rather
than bias, and the MC estimator is a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator
(MVUE). To address the problem, we propose the \textsc{Com}pound \textsc{M}onte
\textsc{C}arlo \textsc{S}ampling (ComMCS) method, which constructs an unbiased
estimator by linearly combining the MC estimators from the current and
subsequent steps. Theoretically, we show that our method leads to a predictable
reduction in variance, while maintaining an unbiased estimation without
additional LLM inference cost. We also perform empirical experiments on the
MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
Notably, ComMCS outperforms regression-based optimization method by 2.8 points,
the non-variance-reduced baseline by 2.2 points on MATH-500 on Best-of-32
sampling experiment.

Conclusion: MSRS为多属性控制提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Activation steering offers a promising approach to controlling the behavior
of Large Language Models by directly manipulating their internal activations.
However, most existing methods struggle to jointly steer multiple attributes,
often resulting in interference and undesirable trade-offs. To address this
challenge, we propose Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS), a novel
framework for effective multi-attribute steering via subspace representation
fine-tuning. MSRS reduces inter-attribute interference by allocating orthogonal
subspaces to each attribute, isolating their influence within the model's
representation space. MSRS also incorporates a hybrid subspace composition
strategy: it combines attribute-specific subspaces for unique steering
directions with a shared subspace for common steering directions. A dynamic
weighting function learns to efficiently integrate these components for precise
control. During inference, MSRS introduces a token-level steering mechanism
that dynamically identifies and intervenes on the most semantically relevant
tokens, enabling fine-grained behavioral modulation. Experimental results show
that MSRS significantly reduces attribute conflicts, surpasses existing methods
across a range of attributes, and generalizes effectively to diverse downstream
tasks.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效扩展到更大网格规模，显著提升策略泛化能力和成功率。

Conclusion: 为大规模广义规划任务提供了实用基础。

Abstract: Generalized planning using deep reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promising results in various symbolic
planning domains described by PDDL. However, existing approaches typically
represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial
explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow,
especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation
results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory
requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale
problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN
representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and
explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our
approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid
world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger
grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and
substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings
provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale
generalized planning tasks.

Result: 实验表明，STEP在两个公共数据集上的推荐精度和对话质量优于主流方法。

Conclusion: STEP通过上下文-知识融合和双提示方案，有效解决了语义不匹配问题，提升了推荐和对话性能。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to proactively capture user
preferences through natural language dialogue and recommend high-quality items.
To achieve this, CRS gathers user preferences via a dialog module and builds
user profiles through a recommendation module to generate appropriate
recommendations. However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep
semantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the
efficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into
dialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional
approaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,
which often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in
recommendations that may not align with user expectations.
  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender
centered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided
context-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its
heart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with
knowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving
fine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected
into the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a
conversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a
recommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent
candidates. This dual-prompt scheme allows the model to share cross-task
semantics while respecting the distinct objectives of dialogue and
recommendation. Experimental results show that STEP outperforms mainstream
methods in the precision of recommendation and dialogue quality in two public
datasets.

Result: 人类在图文不一致时更易识别AI内容。T-Lens能结合预测的人类反应回答用户查询，提升交互能力。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM提供了人类感知能力，揭示了AI、人类认知与信息接收的复杂关系，提出了降低AI误导风险的实际策略。

Abstract: As AI-generated content becomes widespread, so does the risk of
misinformation. While prior research has primarily focused on identifying
whether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content
influences human perception and behavior. In domains like trading or the stock
market, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral),
can be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we
take a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains
154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale
analysis of how people respond to AI-generated content. Our human study reveals
that people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text
and visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two. We
propose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify
how users judge and engage with online content. We present T-Lens, an LLM-based
agent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human
responses to multimodal information. At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response
Model Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol
(MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM. This integration allows
T-Lens to better align with human reactions, enhancing both interpretability
and interaction capabilities. Our work provides empirical insights and
practical tools to equip LLMs with human-awareness capabilities. By
highlighting the complex interplay among AI, human cognition, and information
reception, our findings suggest actionable strategies for mitigating the risks
of AI-driven misinformation.

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型是否通过数据与参数扩展获得结构化、可泛化的内部表征。

Method: 引入临床试验自然语言推理基准（四种推理类型），并使用GKMRV探针分离知识获取与推理失败。

Result: 模型在知识获取上表现优异（准确率0.918），但在推理任务上表现差（准确率0.25），输出一致性高（0.87）。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs缺乏结构化内部表征，无法可靠部署知识，GKMRV框架为高风险领域模型可靠性评估提供有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured,
generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters.
We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language
Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution,
Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction.
Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning
Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual
access from failures of inference. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both
direct and chain of thought prompting.
  Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform
poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy,
output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating
a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts.
  These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations:
current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the
structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably
(e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating
counterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this
dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for
probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了可解释AI（XAI）在视觉障碍用户中的可访问性问题，提出了一种包容性设计方法，并发现简化解释和多模态呈现更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在关键领域的广泛应用，可解释性成为提升用户理解和决策能力的手段，但视觉障碍用户的可访问性研究不足。

Method: 通过文献综述和四部分方法论（分类、角色定义、原型设计、评估）研究XAI的可访问性。

Result: 初步结果表明，简化解释比详细解释更易理解，多模态呈现有助于提升公平性。

Conclusion: XAI设计需考虑视觉障碍用户，简化解释和多模态呈现是实现包容性的关键。

Abstract: As AI systems are increasingly deployed to support decision-making in
critical domains, explainability has become a means to enhance the
understandability of these outputs and enable users to make more informed and
conscious choices. However, despite growing interest in the usability of
eXplainable AI (XAI), the accessibility of these methods, particularly for
users with vision impairments, remains underexplored. This paper investigates
accessibility gaps in XAI through a two-pronged approach. First, a literature
review of 79 studies reveals that evaluations of XAI techniques rarely include
disabled users, with most explanations relying on inherently visual formats.
Second, we present a four-part methodological proof of concept that
operationalizes inclusive XAI design: (1) categorization of AI systems, (2)
persona definition and contextualization, (3) prototype design and
implementation, and (4) expert and user assessment of XAI techniques for
accessibility. Preliminary findings suggest that simplified explanations are
more comprehensible for non-visual users than detailed ones, and that
multimodal presentation is required for more equitable interpretability.
