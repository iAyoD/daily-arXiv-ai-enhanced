The proposed algorithm\nintegrates a real-time dynamic obstacle tracking and mapping system that\ncategorizes point clouds into dynamic and static components. For dynamic point\nclouds, the Kalman filter is employed to estimate and predict their motion\nstates. Based on these predictions, we extrapolate the future states of dynamic\npoint clouds, which are subsequently merged with static point clouds to\nconstruct the forward-time-domain (FTD) map. By combining control barrier\nfunctions (CBFs) with nonlinear model predictive control, the proposed\nalgorithm enables the robot to effectively avoid both static and dynamic\nobstacles. The CBF constraints are formulated based on risk points identified\nthrough collision detection between the predicted future states and the FTD\nmap. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world scenarios\ndemonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in complex environments.

Based\non a non-linear model, an optimal control strategy is proposed, for\nrepositioning the center of mass in a bang-bang manner. Consequently, utilizing\nthe concept of input-output linearization, a continuous control strategy is\nproposed that takes into account the limited torque of the crank-slide\nmechanism and its geometry. An increased attention is paid to energy\naccumulation towards the subsequent jump stage of the brachiation. These two\nstrategies are validated and compared in simulations.
