### [1] [Towards Efficient General Feature Prediction in Masked Skeleton Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03609)
*Shengkai Sun,Zefan Zhang,Jianfeng Dong,Zhiyong Cheng,Xiaojun Chang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GFP框架，用高级特征预测替代传统低级坐标重建，实现更高效的骨架动作识别自监督学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAE方法局限于原始关节坐标重建，导致计算冗余和语义表示有限，需要更高效的特征学习方式

Method: 采用协作学习框架，轻量级目标生成网络动态产生多样化时空层次监督信号，结合约束优化确保特征多样性

Result: 在NTU RGB+D 60/120和PKU-MMD数据集上取得SOTA性能，训练速度比标准方法快6.2倍

Conclusion: 高级特征预测框架GFP在计算效率和表示质量方面均优于传统低级重建方法，为骨架动作识别提供了新思路

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly
propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most
existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or
their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited
semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature
Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key
innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level
feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic
representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework
where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified
supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on
pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained
optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse.
Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits
of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training
than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation
quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 通过教师-学生模型和基于UNet的分割方法，统一解决有缓切图检测和非典型有缓切图分类任务，提高域逆向性能和处理数据不平衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工计数有缓切图耗时且观察者间差异大，AI工具又容易受域假移影响，同时面临严重的数据不平衡问题

Method: 采用教师-学生模型策略，基于UNet分割背骨集成对比表征学习和域对抗训练，通过假掩码生成提高特征区分性，多角度CNN分类器进行多任务学习

Result: 在预测试集上达到Track 1 F1分数0.7660，Track 2平衡准确率0.8414

Conclusion: 统一框架结合分割基础检测和分类能够有效提高有缓切图分析的健壮性和性能

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

### [3] [Multi Attribute Bias Mitigation via Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03616)
*Rajeev Ranjan Dwivedi,Ankur Kumar,Vinod K Kurmi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMBM是一个两阶段框架，通过自适应偏差集成学习和梯度抑制微调，有效解决视觉模型中的多重偏差问题，无需测试时的组标签，并在多个数据集上显著提升最差组准确率和降低偏差放大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图像存在多重重叠偏差（纹理、水印、性别化妆、场景对象配对等），这些偏差会损害视觉模型的鲁棒性和公平性。单独处理每个偏差效果有限，因为缓解一个偏差往往会导致其他偏差加剧。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 自适应偏差集成学习(ABIL)：为每个属性训练编码器并与主干网络集成，强制分类器明确识别这些偏差；2) 梯度抑制微调：从主干梯度中修剪偏差方向，得到忽略所有已识别偏差的紧凑网络。还提出了Scaled Bias Amplification (SBA)指标来解决现有偏差度量在子组不平衡和训练测试分布偏移下的问题。

Result: 在FB CMNIST、CelebA和COCO数据集上验证，提升了最差组准确率，将多属性偏差放大减半，并在SBA指标上创下新低，即使偏差复杂性和分布偏移加剧。

Conclusion: GMBM是第一个实用的端到端多重偏差解决方案，适用于视觉识别任务，能够在测试时最小化偏差，且只需要训练时的组标签。

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including
textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases
collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both
their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves
inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We
tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a
lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and
minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)
deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders
for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the
classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine
Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving
a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to
recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup
imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias
Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias
amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,
CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute
bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and
distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end
multibias solution for visual recognition. Project page:

### [4] [Lightweight image segmentation for echocardiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03631)
*Anders Kjelsrud,Lasse Løvstakken,Erik Smistad,Håvard Dalen,Gilles Van De Vyver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过消融研究发现，简单的仿射增强和深度监督是nnU-Net在心脏超声分割中的关键有效组件，基于此开发了轻量级U-Net模型，参数量减少16倍（2M vs 33M），推理速度提升4倍，同时保持与nnU-Net相当的Dice分数性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然nnU-Net在心脏超声左心室分割中表现良好，但模型过大且推理速度慢，限制了实时应用。需要识别最有效的组件来开发轻量高效的替代方案。

Method: 通过消融研究逐步评估数据增强方案、架构修改、损失函数和后处理技术，识别nnU-Net中最有效的组件，并基于这些洞察开发轻量级U-Net模型。

Result: 在CAMUS数据集（N=500）上，轻量模型达到与nnU-Net统计相当的Dice分数（LV:0.93/0.93, MYO:0.85/0.86, LA:0.89/0.89），参数量减少16倍（2M vs 33M），推理速度快4倍（1.35ms vs 5.40ms每帧）。在内部数据集（N=311）上的跨数据集评估也证实了相当的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 简单仿射增强和深度监督是性能关键，复杂增强和大模型容量收益递减。基于此开发的轻量模型在保持性能的同时显著提升了效率，为实时心脏超声分割应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable
fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and
ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are
large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective
components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study,
incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural
modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis
revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive
performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer
diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net
(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to
nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89
for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster
(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.
Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable
generalization.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

### [6] [Reg3D: Reconstructive Geometry Instruction Tuning for 3D Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03635)
*Hongpei Zheng,Lintao Xiang,Qijun Yang,Qian Lin,Hujun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reg3D是一个创新的重建几何指令调优框架，通过将几何感知监督直接整合到训练过程中，解决了现有方法仅依赖文本监督无法提供3D空间表示学习所需几何约束的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在2D视觉理解方面取得显著进展，但扩展到3D场景理解仍面临挑战。现有方法主要依赖纯文本监督，无法提供学习稳健3D空间表示所需的几何约束。

Method: 采用双监督范式，在双编码器架构中设计互补的对象级和帧级重建任务，将3D几何信息同时作为输入和显式学习目标，通过几何一致性强制空间推理能力的发展。

Result: 在ScanQA、Scan2Cap、ScanRefer和SQA3D等数据集上的广泛实验表明，Reg3D带来了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: Reg3D为空间感知多模态模型建立了一个新的训练范式，通过重建底层几何结构而非仅仅描述它们，实现了有效的3D理解。

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has led to remarkable
progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to
3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the
geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.
In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction
Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware
supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that
effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric
structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that
inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a
dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input
and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary
object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder
architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of
spatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,
ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance
improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware
multimodal models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantV2X是首个完全量化的多智能体V2X协同感知系统，通过统一的端到端量化策略，在保持精度的同时显著降低计算和传输成本，实现3.2倍延迟降低和9.5 mAP30提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有V2X协同感知系统主要关注精度指标，忽视了效率、延迟和实际部署等系统级考量，且大多使用全精度模型导致计算和传输成本过高，难以在资源受限环境中实时运行。

Method: 提出QuantV2X系统，采用统一的端到端量化策略，同时对神经网络模型和传输消息表示进行量化，减少计算负载和传输带宽需求。

Result: 在低比特约束下达到与全精度系统相当的精度，系统级延迟降低3.2倍，mAP30提升9.5，并能更有效地扩展以适应严格的内存预算。

Conclusion: 完全量化的多智能体中间融合系统在实际部署中具有可行性，为V2X协同感知的实用化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating
occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has
predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the
crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world
deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,
which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical
for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system
designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,
multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified
end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and
transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational
load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit
constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.
More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X
reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in
mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more
effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict
memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized
multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system
will be publicly released to promote research in this field:

Conclusion: 深度学习在基于叶脉特征的植物分类中具有巨大潜力，特别是EfficientNetB0模型展现出优异的性能，适合开发准确且可扩展的自动化植物分类工具。

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of three deep learning architectures:
ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 for automated plant species
classification based on leaf venation patterns, a critical morphological
feature with high taxonomic relevance. Using the Swedish Leaf Dataset
comprising images from 15 distinct species (75 images per species, totalling
1,125 images), the models were demonstrated using standard performance metrics
during training and testing phases. ResNet50 achieved a training accuracy of
94.11% but exhibited overfitting, reflected by a reduced testing accuracy of
88.45% and an F1 score of 87.82%. MobileNetV2 demonstrated better
generalization capabilities, attaining a testing accuracy of 93.34% and an F1
score of 93.23%, indicating its suitability for lightweight, real-time
applications. EfficientNetB0 outperformed both models, achieving a testing
accuracy of 94.67% with precision, recall, and F1 scores exceeding 94.6%,
highlighting its robustness in venation-based classification. The findings
underscore the potential of deep learning, particularly EfficientNetB0, in
developing scalable and accurate tools for automated plant taxonomy using

*Casper van Engelenburg,Jan van Gemert,Seyran Khademi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayoutGKN是一种更高效的图匹配方法，通过将跨图节点级交互推迟到联合嵌入架构的末端，使用可微分图核作为距离函数，在保持相似性计算性能的同时显著提高速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平面图通常表示为图结构以捕捉空间关系，图比较在搜索、聚类和数据可视化等应用中至关重要。现有最成功的图匹配方法依赖昂贵的中间跨图节点级交互，导致推理时间缓慢。

Method: 提出LayoutGKN方法，将跨图节点级交互推迟到联合嵌入架构的末端，使用可微分图核作为最终学习节点嵌入的距离函数。

Result: LayoutGKN在相似性计算方面与图匹配网络相当或更好，同时显著提高了速度。

Conclusion: LayoutGKN提供了一种更高效的图匹配解决方案，在保持性能的同时大幅提升推理速度，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that
LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks
while significantly increasing the speed.

### [10] [Singular Value Few-shot Adaptation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03740)
*Taha Koleilat,Hassan Rivaz,Yiming Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD是一种基于奇异值分解的多模态参数高效适应方法，仅微调CLIP参数矩阵的奇异值来实现领域适应，仅使用0.04%的参数就能达到最先进的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型适应方法依赖提示工程和完整微调，成本高且可能破坏预训练知识，需要更高效的适应技术。

Method: 使用奇异值分解(SVD)修改CLIP内部参数空间，仅微调参数矩阵的奇异值来重新缩放基向量，不注入额外模块。

Result: 在11个自然和10个生物医学数据集上达到最先进分类结果，在少样本设置下准确率和泛化能力均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD提供了一种参数高效、性能优越且可解释的CLIP适应方法，能更好地保持模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对全球食品安全需求，精准农业和植物病害诊断致关重要。但将高精度模型部署到边缘设备面临挑战，传统注意机制无法有效捕捉病变特征的细微形状和复杂纹理

Method: 1）使用无需训练的神经网络查找方法DeepMAD构建高效边缘网络背榜 2）提出形状-纹理注意力模块STAM，通过可变卷积和Gabor滤波器分别关注形状和纹理特征

Result: 在CCMT植物病害数据集上，STA-Net模型（401K参数，51.1M FLOPs）达到89.00%准确率和88.96%的F1分数，消融实验证明STAM显著提升了基线和标准注意力模型的性能

Conclusion: 通过解耦注意力机制集成领域知识，为边缘部署的精准农业AI提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了水下伪装目标检测(UCOD)任务，创建了DeepCamo基准数据集，并开发了SLENet框架，通过Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement模块和Localization Guidance Branch提升检测性能，在多个数据集上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下伪装目标检测对海洋生态学至关重要，但现有研究不足，且受到光学畸变、水体浑浊和海洋生物复杂特性的严重阻碍。

Method: 提出SLENet框架，包含Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement(GAE)模块和Localization Guidance Branch(LGB)，通过多尺度特征增强和全局语义信息定位图指导Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder(MSSD)进行预测。

Result: 在DeepCamo数据集和三个基准COD数据集上的实验表明，SLENet性能优于现有最先进方法，并显示出对更广泛COD任务的高度通用性。

Conclusion: SLENet框架有效解决了水下伪装目标检测的挑战，为海洋生态研究提供了有力的技术支撑，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that
blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically
important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and
accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water
turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these
challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark
dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and
Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark
state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet
is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)
module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature
representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic
information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to
produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and
three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA
methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

*Juhun Lee,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过利用视频序列的时间归纳偏置，提出了一种无需改变网络结构的训练策略，显著提升了图像滿散模型的训练效率和生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固有的静态图像训练方式存在信息缺失，导致收敛慢、分布覆盖有限和沿生性不足的问题

Method: 利用连续视频帧的时间归纳偏置，提出了一种简单有效的训练策略，无需网络结构修改，可无缝集成到标准滿散训练流程

Result: 在HandCo数据集上验证，训练收敛速度提升2倍以上，训练和验证集上均获得更低的FID指标，同时提升了生成的多样性

Conclusion: 该方法通过降低梯度方差促进更快的收敛，证明了利用时间归纳偏置对滿散模型训练的重要价值

Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images.
While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the
temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by
design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional
coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and
effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present
in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed
method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated
into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the
HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence
and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically
distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over
2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation
distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model
to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization
analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which
contributes to faster convergence.

TL;DR: MedVista3D是一个用于3D CT分析的多尺度语义增强视觉语言预训练框架，通过局部和全局图像文本对齐解决放射诊断中的漏读、注意力盲点和沟通失败问题，在多个任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决放射诊断中普遍存在的漏读错误、注意力盲点和沟通失败问题，这些问题源于局部异常遗漏、全局上下文有限和报告语言变异性，在3D影像中尤为严重。

Method: 提出MedVista3D框架，进行局部和全局图像文本对齐以实现细粒度表示学习；使用语言模型重写和放射学语义匹配库来解决报告变异性问题。

Result: 在零样本疾病分类、报告检索和医学视觉问答任务上达到最先进性能，同时在器官分割和预后预测任务上表现出良好的迁移能力。

Conclusion: MedVista3D通过多尺度语义增强的视觉语言预训练，有效解决了3D放射诊断中的关键挑战，为精准医疗诊断提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness,
and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues
often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and
variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,
where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them
requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level
reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,
existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,
lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with
the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present
MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining
framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic
interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for
fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address
report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology
Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report
retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to
organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be
released.

*Mengyu Gao,Qiulei Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaPL是一种基于因果推理的视觉粒度化提示学习方法，通过属性解耦和粒度学习模块，显著提升了CLIP在细粒度识别任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CLIP提示学习方法在处理细粒度数据集时表现有限，需要一种能够捕捉类别间细微差异的方法。

Method: 提出CaPL方法，包含属性解耦模块（使用布朗桥扩散模型分解视觉特征）和粒度学习模块（通过因果推理策略构建视觉粒度）。

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验表明，CaPL显著优于最先进的提示学习方法，特别是在细粒度数据集上。

Conclusion: 通过视觉粒度化和因果推理，CaPL能够学习更具判别性的文本提示，有效提升CLIP在细粒度识别任务中的性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition
tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only
show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual
granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation
technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to
capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through
casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An
attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into
non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized
attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules
by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal
inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more
discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental
results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on
fine-grained datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于事件相机的事件幸运融合框架EGTM，通过事件流的时空分布特性来指导湍流消除，在模型效率上相比现有方法有数百倍的提升，同时实现了更好的恢复质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的湍流消除方法需要从有限帧率的同步帧中学习粗粒度的湍流动态，导致计算和存储效率低下。事件相机具有微秒级时间分辨率，能够通过稀疏异步成像机制从根本上解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 提出了"事件幸运洞察"理论，揭示了湍流扭曲与事件流逆时空分布的关联；构建了EGTM框架，从显式但嘈杂的湍流事件中提取像素级可靠的湍流无关指导信息，用于时序幸运融合；建立了首个真实世界的事件驱动湍流数据集。

Result: 在真实世界EGTM数据集上，该方法在模型大小、推理延迟和模型复杂度方面分别比现有SOTA方法提升了710倍、214倍和224倍，同时PSNR提升了0.94，SSIM提升了0.08，达到了最先进的恢复质量。

Conclusion: 将事件模态引入湍流消除任务具有显著的效率优势，事件相机的微秒级时间分辨率和稀疏异步成像机制为湍流消除提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and
blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing
state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple
degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky
fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from
coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited
frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event
cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to
fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous
imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental
\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence
distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,
build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts
pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy
turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first
turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world
event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214
times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity
respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality
(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating
the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo
code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released
once accepted.

TL;DR: FocusMamba是一个RGB-事件检测方法，通过事件引导的多模态稀疏化和跨模态聚焦融合，自适应地丢弃低信息区域，在精度和效率上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-事件检测方法在处理两种模态的低信息区域时采用统一处理方式，导致计算成本高且性能不佳。固定数量的token选择方法无法适应不同复杂度的样本。

Method: 提出事件引导多模态稀疏化(EGMS)策略，利用事件相机感知的场景变化来自适应丢弃各模态中的低信息区域；设计跨模态聚焦融合(CMFF)模块来有效整合互补特征。

Result: 在DSEC-Det和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FocusMamba通过自适应协同稀疏化和高效融合互补信息，实现了RGB-事件检测任务中精度与效率的更好平衡。

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of
both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)
uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational
costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy
during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token
sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these
methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the
retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve
a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which
performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and
efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided
Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and
adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging
scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the
sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed
to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both
modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing methods. The code will be available at

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了零样本食物识别中的关键挑战，为食物识别领域提供了新的解决方案和基准数据集

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is
avaliable at https://github.com/Jiajun-RUC/SalientFusion.

Abstract: Human motion video generation has garnered significant research interest due
to its broad applications, enabling innovations such as photorealistic singing
heads or dynamic avatars that seamlessly dance to music. However, existing
surveys in this field focus on individual methods, lacking a comprehensive
overview of the entire generative process. This paper addresses this gap by
providing an in-depth survey of human motion video generation, encompassing
over ten sub-tasks, and detailing the five key phases of the generation
process: input, motion planning, motion video generation, refinement, and
output. Notably, this is the first survey that discusses the potential of large
language models in enhancing human motion video generation. Our survey reviews
the latest developments and technological trends in human motion video
generation across three primary modalities: vision, text, and audio. By
covering over two hundred papers, we offer a thorough overview of the field and
highlight milestone works that have driven significant technological
breakthroughs. Our goal for this survey is to unveil the prospects of human

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归方法在占用世界建模中存在效率低下、长期生成时出现时间退化以及缺乏可控性等问题，需要一种新的方法来同时解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出TENS任务将时间序列建模分解为空间尺度生成和时间场景预测，使用TensFormer管理时间因果关系和空间关系，并采用整体姿态聚合策略增强姿态可控性。

Result: 实验表明OccTENS在占用质量和推理时间方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: OccTENS通过创新的时间下一尺度预测框架，成功实现了高效、高质量且可控的长期占用生成，为3D场景的动态演化建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that
enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while
maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the
occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic
evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.
Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential
to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from
historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency},
\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of
controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the
occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which
decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial
scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a
\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and
spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To
enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose
aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy
and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art
method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不同类别物体匹配的挑战性场景中，物体的功能（即物体对其他物体产生的影响）可以指导如何建立对应关系，因为实现特定功能的对象部件通常在形状和外观上具有相似性。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型对多视角图像进行伪标注获取功能部件，然后与基于像素对应的密集对比学习相结合，将功能和空间知识蒸馏到一个新模型中，从而建立密集功能对应关系。

Result: 构建了合成和真实评估数据集作为任务基准，实验结果表明该方法优于基于现成自监督图像表示和接地视觉语言模型的基线解决方案。

Conclusion: 通过结合视觉语言模型的伪标注能力和密集对比学习，成功实现了跨类别物体的密集功能对应关系建立，为形状重建和机器人操作等任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks
such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting
of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the
effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences
should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific
functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the
definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and
propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.
The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language
models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then
integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to
distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can
establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and
real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf
self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

Method: 开发了一种集成方法，将通用的YOLOv8模型与专门的热成模型结合，使用精细的边框融合算法来统合它们的预测结果

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法达到了0.93的平均精度(mAP@.5)和0.90的F1分数，超过了单独使用YOLOv8模型的0.91的mAP@.5成绩

Conclusion: 结论表明，结合多个YOLO架构和融合多光谱数据提供了更可靠的解决方案，显著改善了可见光和热成缺陷的检测能力

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

Result: Attn-Adapter在跨类别和跨数据集泛化方面优于最先进方法，保持高效推理能力，并能在不同CLIP骨干网络上扩展。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了CLIP在少样本学习中的适应性问题，提供了一种无需重新训练基础模型的高效在线学习方法，在多个维度上展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models excel in zero-shot image recognition but
face challenges in few-shot scenarios due to computationally intensive offline
fine-tuning using prompt learning, which risks overfitting. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Attn-Adapter, a novel online few-shot learning
framework that enhances CLIP's adaptability via a dual attention mechanism. Our
design incorporates dataset-specific information through two components: the
Memory Attn-Adapter, which refines category embeddings using support examples,
and the Local-Global Attn-Adapter, which enriches image embeddings by
integrating local and global features. This architecture enables dynamic
adaptation from a few labeled samples without retraining the base model.
Attn-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and
cross-dataset generalization, maintaining efficient inference and scaling

TL;DR: SPECS是一个针对长图像描述任务的参考无关评估指标，通过改进CLIP模型来强调特异性，在保持与人类判断高度相关的同时大幅提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像描述评估指标存在不足：n-gram指标无法捕捉语义正确性，基于表示相似性的指标计算成本高且与人类判断相关性低，而基于大语言模型的指标虽然相关性好但计算成本过高，不适合模型开发中的迭代使用。

Method: SPECS通过修改CLIP模型，引入新的目标函数来强调特异性，奖励正确的细节描述并惩罚错误的描述，从而构建一个参考无关的表示相似性指标。

Result: SPECS在相关性方面与开源LLM-based指标相当，但计算效率显著更高，使其成为图像描述模型开发中迭代检查点评估的实用替代方案。

Conclusion: SPECS提供了一个既高效又与人类判断高度相关的评估指标，解决了长图像描述任务中现有评估方法的局限性，为模型开发提供了实用的评估工具。

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for
developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances
have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we
develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that
introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided
synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer
architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset
to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves
accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative
metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation
and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across
disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small
fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse
patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating
demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative
foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive
3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and
transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based
end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on
single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios
underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding
(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while
enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively
leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance
dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion
correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction
method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded
independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model
that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content
correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module
that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content
features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures
inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC
framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC
standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research
in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖体素重叠度量，无法保证拓扑正确性和完整性。虽然拓扑感知损失和持久同调约束有潜力，但通常应用于局部补丁，无法保证全局保持或在推理时纠正几何错误。

Method: 采用整体区域建模策略捕捉完整空间上下文；首次引入拓扑完整性Betti（TIB）约束，联合执行Betti数先验和全局完整性；使用持久同调的课程精炼方案，从粗到细逐步纠正错误。

Result: 在肺气道和Willis环数据集上，β₀误差分别从69.00降至3.40和从1.65降至0.30，树长度检测和分支检测率提高了近10%。

Conclusion: TopoSculpt能有效纠正关键拓扑错误，推进复杂3D管状解剖结构的高保真建模，在几何和拓扑方面都有显著改进。

Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional
conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.
Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for
applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial
connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap
measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.
Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown
promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global
preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological
refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a
holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)
first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly
enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a
curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct
errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging
pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors
are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on
the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving
by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in
correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling
of complex 3D tubular anatomy. The project homepage is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用U-Net网络以EfficientNet-B4作为编码器的深度学习模型，在气胸分割任务上达到了0.7008 IoU和0.8241 Dice分数，能够准确定位气胸并支持放射科医生的诊断工作。

Motivation: 气胸是一种可能威胎生命的疾病，胸部X光照是首选诊断方法，但轻微症状容易被漏诊，需要自动化诊断工具来提高诊断准确性。

Method: 构建了一个基于U-Net网络架构的深度学习流水线，使用EfficientNet-B4作为编码器。在SIIM-ACR数据集上进行训练，采用数据增广技术和二元交叉瑣勒加Dice损失函数的组合损失。

Result: 在独立的PTX-498数据集上，模型达到了IoU 0.7008和Dice分数0.8241的高分数，表明模型能够准确地定位和分割气胸区域。

Abstract: Pneumothorax, the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space, can be
life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic
tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning
pipeline using a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder to segment pneumothorax
regions. Trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation and a combined
binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss, the model achieved an IoU of 0.7008 and
Dice score of 0.8241 on the independent PTX-498 dataset. These results
demonstrate that the model can accurately localize pneumothoraces and support

*Zhu Wenjie,Zhang Yabin,Xin Jin,Wenjun Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出自适应负文本空间(ANTS)方法，利用多模态大语言模型的理解和推理能力来增强OOD检测，通过生成精确描述OOD分布的负标签，显著降低误报率并提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对OOD图像的理解，难以构建准确的负空间，且假负标签会严重降低近OOD检测性能。需要一种能够精确表征OOD分布并减少假负标签的方法。

Method: 利用MLLMs识别可能的OOD样本并生成表达性负句子来精确描述OOD分布。对于近OOD场景，识别与负图像视觉相似的ID类别子集，生成针对性的视觉相似负标签。设计自适应加权分数来平衡两种负文本空间。

Result: 在ImageNet基准上，ANTS将FPR95降低了4.2%，达到了新的最先进水平。方法无需训练且零样本，具有高可扩展性。

Conclusion: ANTS方法通过利用MLLMs的理解和推理能力，有效构建了自适应负文本空间，显著提升了OOD检测性能，特别是在处理近OOD和远OOD场景时表现出色，且具有良好的适应性和可扩展性。

Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an
understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate
negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels
significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we
propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the
understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative
images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive
negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance
far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the
in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that
are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning
capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to
this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD
detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an
adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task
settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior
knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet
benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,
enabling high scalability.

TL;DR: MMChange是一个多模态遥感变化检测方法，结合图像和文本模态，通过图像特征细化、文本差异增强和图像文本特征融合模块，显著提升了变化检测的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法仅依赖图像模态，在特征表示、变化模式建模和泛化能力方面存在局限，特别是在光照和噪声干扰下表现不佳。

Method: 提出MMChange方法：1）图像特征细化模块突出关键区域并抑制环境噪声；2）使用视觉语言模型生成双时相图像的语义描述；3）文本差异增强模块捕捉细粒度语义变化；4）图像文本特征融合模块实现深度跨模态集成。

Result: 在LEVIRCD、WHUCD和SYSUCD数据集上的大量实验表明，MMChange在多个指标上一致超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: MMChange通过多模态融合有效解决了遥感变化检测中的语义限制和噪声干扰问题，验证了多模态方法在该领域的有效性。

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

TL;DR: SAC-MIL是一种用于WSI分类的空间感知相关多实例学习方法，通过位置编码模块处理空间关系，使用MLP-based的SAC块实现线性时间复杂度的全实例相关性计算，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决WSI分类中空间信息编码和实例相关性计算的问题，特别是处理训练和测试序列长度不同的外推问题，同时避免Transformer方法需要定制CUDA内核的部署复杂性

Method: 包含位置编码模块（利用实例坐标而非索引编码空间关系）和SAC块（基于MLP实现线性时间复杂度的全实例相关性计算），采用MLP简单结构便于部署

Result: 在CAMELYON-16、TCGA-LUNG和TCGA-BRAC数据集上取得了最先进的性能

Conclusion: SAC-MIL通过空间感知的位置编码和高效的MLP-based相关性计算，为WSI分类提供了既高性能又易于部署的解决方案

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Motivation: 无对比剂肝脏MRI数据更常见，但血管分割面临挑战且需要大量标注数据，而对比增强影像序列并非均匀采集

Method: 多任务学习框架，利用训练期间的成对原始和对比增强MRI数据（有无血管标注），通过共享任务结构改善特征表示

Result: 辅助数据显著提升血管分割精度，尤其在训练标注较少时效果更为明显，该方法在脑结节分割任务中也得到验证

Conclusion: 即使只在训练期间可用，信息丰富的辅助影像模态仍可有效增强专家标注，推广至不同领域

Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for
the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide
spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast
enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not
uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more
frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale
annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels
in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data
available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training
examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with
and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary
data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not
available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few
annotations are available for training, since the feature representation
benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to
augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across
different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert
annotations even if it is only available during training.

TL;DR: 大型多模态模型在多项选择题回答中的提示词设计存在显著敏感性，微小变化可导致15%的准确率差异。作者提出Promptception框架系统评估提示词敏感性，发现专有模型对提示词语义更敏感，开源模型更稳定但处理复杂提示能力较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型多模态模型在多项选择题回答中的提示词设计缺乏系统性研究，模型评估存在不公平性，因为不同提示词会导致性能差异巨大，需要建立标准化评估框架。

Method: 提出Promptception框架，包含61种提示词类型、15个类别和6个超类别，用于评估10个不同规模的多模态模型在3个基准测试集上的表现。

Result: 专有模型对提示词语义更敏感，反映其与指令语义的紧密对齐；开源模型表现更稳定但在处理复杂和细致提示时存在困难。提示词变化可导致高达15%的准确率差异。

Conclusion: 需要针对专有和开源模型制定不同的提示词设计原则，以实现更稳健和公平的模型评估，提升多模态模型评估的透明度和可比性。

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

TL;DR: 该文章提出了SliceSemOcc框架，通过竖直切片和高度维度注意力机制改善了3D语义占位预测的性能，尤其在小物体检测上取得显著进步。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的3D语义占位预测方法忽视了高度轴信息的处理，传统的通道注意力机制在所有高度层上赋予均匀权重，限制了在不同高度层强调特征的能力。

Method: 提出SliceSemOcc框架：1）使用全局和局部竖直切片沿高度轴提取氧克尔特征 2）全局局部融合模块协调细细苡空间细节和整体上下文信息 3）SEAttention3D模块通过平均池化保持高度分辨率，并为每个高度层赋予动态通道注意力权重。

Conclusion: 详细的消融研究进一步验证了提出的SliceSemOcc框架的有效性，为3D语义占位预测领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic
occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike
bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D
plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial
structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the
vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis
information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style
channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting
their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these
limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal
framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract
voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical
slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained
spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose
the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through
average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height
layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy
datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving
especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation
studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc
framework.

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

Conclusion: LML是一个有价值的新问题，提出的计数网络和MPEM模块能有效解决该问题，高多数类比例的包有助于学习

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to
train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using
the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,
including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer
sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a
Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by
counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis
experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high
proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we
developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the
proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within
the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on
four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies
confirmed the effectiveness of each module. The code is available at

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance
technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of
response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient
deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the
efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time

millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts
a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and
MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card
parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight
YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming
a closed-loop control chain of "detection-tracking-feedback". Experimental
results demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame
comprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video
stream processing, with a multi-scale target recognition accuracy of over
98.5%, featuring both low latency and high precision. This study provides an

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the
overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous
studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can
cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and
occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view
bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates
multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted
Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from
re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same
identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to
generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight
selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an
effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning
or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate
our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and
Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves
Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking
results. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method
achieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets:
MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
demonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to
other re-ranking methods.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and
their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing
methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced
architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and
(ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of
frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy
segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods
let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors
are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a
method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and
Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the
strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first
perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality
features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer
semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and

Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark

Abstract: Efficient perception models are essential for Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS), as these applications require rapid processing and response to
ensure safety and effectiveness in real-world environments. To address the
real-time execution needs of such perception models, this study introduces the
TriLiteNet model. This model can simultaneously manage multiple tasks related
to panoramic driving perception. TriLiteNet is designed to optimize performance
while maintaining low computational costs. Experimental results on the BDD100k
dataset demonstrate that the model achieves competitive performance across
three key tasks: vehicle detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line
segmentation. Specifically, the TriLiteNet_{base} demonstrated a recall of
85.6% for vehicle detection, a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 92.4% for
drivable area segmentation, and an Acc of 82.3% for lane line segmentation with
only 2.35M parameters and a computational cost of 7.72 GFLOPs. Our proposed
model includes a tiny configuration with just 0.14M parameters, which provides
a multi-task solution with minimal computational demand. Evaluated for latency
and power consumption on embedded devices, TriLiteNet in both configurations
shows low latency and reasonable power during inference. By balancing
performance, computational efficiency, and scalability, TriLiteNet offers a
practical and deployable solution for real-world autonomous driving
applications. Code is available at https://github.com/chequanghuy/TriLiteNet.

Abstract: Event cameras like Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) report micro-timed brightness
changes instead of full frames, offering low latency, high dynamic range, and
motion robustness. DVS-PedX (Dynamic Vision Sensor Pedestrian eXploration) is a
neuromorphic dataset designed for pedestrian detection and crossing-intention
analysis in normal and adverse weather conditions across two complementary
sources: (1) synthetic event streams generated in the CARLA simulator for
controlled "approach-cross" scenes under varied weather and lighting; and (2)
real-world JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using the v2e tool,
preserving natural behaviors and backgrounds. Each sequence includes paired RGB
frames, per-frame DVS "event frames" (33 ms accumulations), and frame-level
labels (crossing vs. not crossing). We also provide raw AEDAT 2.0/AEDAT 4.0
event files and AVI DVS video files and metadata for flexible re-processing.
Baseline spiking neural networks (SNNs) using SpikingJelly illustrate dataset
usability and reveal a sim-to-real gap, motivating domain adaptation and
multimodal fusion. DVS-PedX aims to accelerate research in event-based
pedestrian safety, intention prediction, and neuromorphic perception.

TL;DR: TaleDiffusion是一种新的案案，通过迭代过程生成多角色故事图像，采用边界关注掩码技术、身份一致自注意力和区域感知交叉注意力机制，并通过CLIPSeg准确分配对话气泡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多角色故事可视化中存在角色不一致、产生人工故障物和对话渲染不准确等问题，导致故事迷乱不连贯。

Method: 使用预训练的大语言模型通过上下文学习生成每帧描述、角色细节和对话，采用边界关注基于每个框的掩码技术控制角色交互，并通过身份一致自注意力和区域感知交叉注意力确保一致性和准确对象置位。

Result: 实验结果显示TaleDiffusion在一致性、降低噪声和对话渲染方面超过现有方法。

Conclusion: TaleDiffusion能够有效解决多角色故事可视化中的一致性问题，生成连贯且对话准确的故事图像。

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent
interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle
with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate
dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we
introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character
stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and
accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a
pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and
dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based
per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize
artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to
ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for
precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned
to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion
outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue
rendering.

Conclusion: 该框架支持轻量级集成和替换专家模型，提供强大的可扩展性，并通过交互界面实现实时空间布局编辑和区域风格选择

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but
they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic
diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

Conclusion: 简单的调参方法可以显著提升深度伪造检测器的性能，在准确性、计算成本和可解释性之间找到平衡点，提高实际部署的可行性

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake
detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates
deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently
released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve
accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading
commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these
baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts
standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake
detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple
approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this
baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We
discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability,
focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in
real-world settings. Our code can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像标注工具需要大量人工输入，限制了大规模数据集的可扩展性。为了解决这个问题，需要开发一个能够自动化标注流程、减少人工干预的工具。

Method: 结合CLIP模型与预训练检测器（如Ultralytics模型）和零样本模型（如Grounding DINO），使用低置信度阈值生成初始标注，并通过交互式工具进行精炼。集成Segment Anything进行实时分割，利用WebGPU加速浏览器端计算。

Conclusion: VisioFirm通过AI辅助自动化显著提升了图像标注效率，为大规模数据集标注提供了可行的解决方案，同时保持了高质量的标注结果。

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding
boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has
on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU
for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,
COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing
accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort
through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation
accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and
IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from

TL;DR: DUDE是一种基于特征解缠的无监督跨域图像检索方法，通过文本到图像生成模型分离对象特征和域特定风格，并采用渐进式跨域对齐策略，在三个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UCIR方法在整个图像层面进行跨域特征对齐，往往难以处理域间差异，因为关键的检索对象特征经常与域特定风格纠缠在一起。

Method: 利用文本到图像生成模型进行特征解缠，将对象特征从域特定风格中分离出来，并采用渐进式跨域互邻对齐策略来实现可靠的特征对齐。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的13个域中取得了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: DUDE通过特征解缠和渐进式对齐策略有效解决了跨域图像检索中的域间差异问题，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of
the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations.
Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

Conclusion: 集成DMP形态信息能够有效提升遥感图像语义分割的性能，混合架构方式显示出更好的效果，为遥感图像分析提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications
in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art
segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective
photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as
extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image
sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile
(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,
into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can
provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior
detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we
extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by
integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and
transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,
which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP
channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP
encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP
differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape
information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally
outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms
direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and
Recall.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography
(PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its
widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary
information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we
propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis,
leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma
measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217
measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides
anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and
evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a
range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data
augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective
alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of
disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive
conditions.

Abstract: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation,
most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance
for feature extraction and important prior information from
  datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image
segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization
methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong
explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial
regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone
segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are
estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone
segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint,
ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled
image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design
a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit
volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the
unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results
on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset
show the superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 该方法为在极稀疏视角和无监督条件下学习复杂动态对象表征提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object
representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that
require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our
approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera
supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each
articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D
reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense
correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further
separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and
object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and
kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose
consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples
demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object
representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing
approaches.

Abstract: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar
categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to
conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the
potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models
to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with
reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps
and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel
method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify
and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves
classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in
challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method
is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with
state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior
performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100

Abstract: The recently introduced odd-one-out anomaly detection task involves
identifying the odd-looking instances within a multi-object scene. This problem
presents several challenges for modern deep learning models, demanding spatial
reasoning across multiple views and relational reasoning to understand context
and generalize across varying object categories and layouts. We argue that
these challenges must be addressed with efficiency in mind. To this end, we
propose a DINO-based model that reduces the number of parameters by one third
and shortens training time by a factor of three compared to the current
state-of-the-art, while maintaining competitive performance. Our experimental
evaluation also introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model baseline,
providing insights into its current limitations in structured visual reasoning
tasks. The project page can be found at

*Pengyue Jia,Yingyi Zhang,Xiangyu Zhao,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoArena是一个评估大型视觉语言模型图像地理定位能力的开放平台，解决了现有评估方法的数据泄露和隐私问题，通过真实野外图像和人类判断进行更准确的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像地理定位评估存在两个主要问题：1）数据泄露 - 大型视觉语言模型在测试数据集上预训练，影响评估准确性；2）现有指标依赖精确坐标，忽视推理过程且存在隐私问题。

Method: 开发GeoArena平台，允许用户上传真实野外图像构建多样化评估语料库，利用成对人类判断来确定模型输出与人类期望的匹配程度。

Result: 平台在线部署两个月，收集了数千条投票记录，基于这些数据进行了详细分析，并建立了不同LVLM在图像地理定位任务上的排行榜。

Conclusion: GeoArena提供了一个真实野外和以人为中心的基准测试平台，为评估大型视觉语言模型的图像地理定位能力提供了更准确和隐私友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images
captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant
challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations.
First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language
models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently
pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a
model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily
rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only
neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level
location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a
first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization
tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena
enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation
corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model
output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed
online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records.
Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard
of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

TL;DR: FE2E框架首次将基于DiT架构的图像编辑模型用于密集几何估计，通过重新制定训练目标和量化策略，在零样本深度和法线估计任务上取得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集预测本质上是图像到图像任务，图像编辑模型相比文本到图像生成模型可能更适合作为微调基础。研究发现编辑模型具有固有的结构先验，能更稳定地收敛并获得更高性能

Method: 提出FE2E框架，将先进的DiT架构编辑模型适配于密集几何预测。重新制定编辑器的流匹配损失为"一致速度"训练目标，使用对数量化解决精度冲突，利用DiT的全局注意力实现深度和法线的联合估计

Result: 无需扩大训练数据，FE2E在多个数据集的零样本单目深度和法线估计中取得显著性能提升。在ETH3D数据集上性能提升超过35%，优于使用100倍训练数据的DepthAnything系列

Conclusion: 图像编辑模型比生成模型更适合密集几何估计任务，FE2E框架通过有效利用编辑模型的结构先验和DiT架构的优势，在零样本几何估计方面取得了突破性进展

Abstract: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MICACL是一个多实例学习框架，通过图增强实例交互模块和加权实例聚合网络解决动态面部表情识别的长尾分布和时空特征建模问题，结合多尺度类别感知对比学习策略，在DFEW和FERV39k数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态面部表情识别面临长尾类别分布和复杂时空特征建模的挑战，现有深度学习方法存在模型归纳偏差问题，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出MICACL框架：1）图增强实例交互模块(GEIIM)通过自适应邻接矩阵和多尺度卷积捕获时空依赖关系；2）加权实例聚合网络(WIAN)基于实例重要性动态分配权重；3）多尺度类别感知对比学习(MCCL)策略平衡主次类别训练。

Result: 在DFEW和FERV39k等野外数据集上的大量实验表明，MICACL实现了最先进的性能，具有优越的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: MICACL框架有效解决了动态面部表情识别中的长尾分布和时空建模问题，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due
to long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature
modeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER
performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model
induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates
spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning
optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction
Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances
relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions.
To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance
Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance
importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive
Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor
categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and
FERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and generalization.

Motivation: 执法人员广泛使用随身摄像机记录事故现场，但在时间紧迫的情况下审查冗长视频不切实际。需要能够快速解读的简洁视觉摘要来提供有效的情境感知。

Method: 利用单目SLAM估计摄像机轨迹和重建环境空间布局，通过聚类摄像机姿态识别关键视点，从每个聚类中选择代表性帧，使用多帧拼接技术将这些帧融合成空间一致的全景图像。

Result: 生成的摘要能够快速理解复杂环境，促进高效决策和事故审查。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将冗长的随身摄像机视频转换为信息丰富的全景图像摘要，为执法人员提供了快速理解事故现场的有效工具。

Abstract: First responders widely adopt body-worn cameras to document incident scenes
and support post-event analysis. However, reviewing lengthy video footage is
impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness
demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work
presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into
informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method
leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate
camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key
viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and
representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused
into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching
techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex
environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.

TL;DR: AnomalyLMM是首个利用大型多模态模型进行基于文本的人员异常搜索的框架，通过粗到细的流程和无需训练的适配方法，在PAB数据集上实现了+0.96% Recall@1的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着公共安全需求增长，基于文本的人员异常搜索成为关键任务，但面临细粒度跨模态对齐和稀疏真实样本下异常识别的挑战，现有大型多模态模型在此任务中的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出AnomalyLMM框架，包含：1）粗到细流程整合LMMs桥接生成式知识和检索式异常检测；2）无需训练的适配方法，包括掩码跨模态提示、行为显著性预测和知识感知重排序。

Result: 在PAB数据集（唯一公开的基于文本人员异常搜索基准）上实验显示，方法有效，超越竞争基线+0.96% Recall@1准确率，并展示出文本异常与视觉行为之间的可解释对齐。

Conclusion: AnomalyLMM成功探索了LMMs在人员异常搜索任务中的应用，提供了有效的零样本解决方案，代码和模型将开源以供未来研究。

Abstract: With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has
emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal
behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,
this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal
alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly
recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models
(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained
anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between
generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of
efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose
AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person
anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline
integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric
anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked
cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware
re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study
to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB
dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly
search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,
falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the
proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1
accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual
anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code
and models will be released for future research.

Motivation: 现有美学图像描述研究主要依赖微调方法，没有专门让多模态大语言模型关注目标美学内容，需要解决这一局限性。

Method: 提出了端到端的ASE-MLLM框架，包含图像美学显著性模块(IASM)高效提取美学显著性特征，并通过IAS-ViT图像编码器使用交叉注意力机制将美学特征与原始图像特征融合。

Result: 在主流美学图像描述基准测试中显著优于传统方法和通用多模态大语言模型，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ASE-MLLM是首个将图像美学显著性整合到多模态大语言模型中专门用于美学图像描述任务的框架，实验证明其有效性。

Abstract: Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of
image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of
computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in
image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.
However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on
predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.
Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods
without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To
address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal
Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly
incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce
the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively
extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design
IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency
features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the
best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image
aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods
and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 一种新的3D风格转换方法，利用预训练2D滿散模型的知识，通过跨视图风格对齐和实例级风格转换，实现更好的风格语义提取和结构清晰的3D场景风格化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D风格转换方法在提取高级风格语义方面效果不佳，风格化结果缺乏结构清晰度和实例分离，导致不同对象难以区分。

Method: 方法包含两个关键阶段：首先利用滿散模型生成关键视点的风格化渲染，然后将风格化关键视图转移到3D表示。重点设计了跨视图风格对齐（在UNet最后一个上采样块中插入跨视图注意力）和实例级风格转换。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在各种场景中（从前向视角到具有挑战性的360度环境）都显著超过了现有的最先进方法，实现了更结构化、视觉一致和艺术丰富的风格化效果。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的新型3D风格转换流水线通过利用预训练2D滿散模型的知识，有效解决了现有方法在高级风格语义提取和结构清晰性方面的不足，为3D场景风格化提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer
to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto
3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and
transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.
Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and
separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or
objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from
pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,
we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.
Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This
process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style
alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of
the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures
that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style
fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style
transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across
stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in
a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D
style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree
environments. Visit our project page https://jm-xu.github.io/SSGaussian for

Motivation: 传统迭代方法和深度学习方法在X射线叠层成像中，特别是在低剂量高速实验的低信号条件下，对未知探针的重建效果不佳，限制了该技术的广泛应用

Method: 提出PtyINR框架，将物体和探针参数化为连续神经表示，直接从原始衍射图样进行端到端重建，无需探针预表征

Result: 在模拟和实验数据上均实现了优越的重建质量，在挑战性低信号条件下表现出显著鲁棒性

Conclusion: PtyINR提供了一个通用、物理信息化的框架，适用于解决探针依赖的逆问题，可广泛应用于计算显微镜领域

Abstract: X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely
applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full
potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing
images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods
and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the
low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These
limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader
adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic
Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that
simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By
parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs
end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without
requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both
simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging
low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable,
physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems,
making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

Conclusion: 面向图像的方法为真实世界多模态安全数据集的构建提供了新的视角，解决了现有方法在覆盖复杂安全场景和评估标准化方面的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

<details>

Motivation: 现有评估方法单独测试理解和生成能力，无法揭示模型在跨模态循环转换中是否能保持语义一致性

Method: 设计循环评估协议，交替进行I2T和T2I多代转换，提出三个指标：MCD（平均累积漂移）、SDR（语义漂移率）、MGG（多代GenEval）

Result: 评估7个最新模型发现显著差异：BAGEL能保持语义稳定，而Vila-u尽管单次评分高但漂移迅速

Conclusion: 循环一致性评估是标准I2T和T2I评估的必要补充，为统一模型的跨模态稳定性提供了实用评估指标

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

Motivation: 流基3D生成模型需要数十步采样，虽然Consistency Models在2D模型中取得进展，但在更复杂的3D生成任务中研究不足

Method: 提出MDT-dist框架，通过Velocity Matching和Velocity Distillation两种可优化目标，等价转换从运输层面到速度和分布层面的优化

Result: 在TRELLIS框架上，将每个流变换器的采样步数从25步降到1-2步，实现0.68s(1步x2)和0.94s(2步x2)延迟，速度提升9.0x和6.5x，保持高视觉和几何保真度

Conclusion: 方法显著超过现有CM蒸萌方法，使TRELLIS在少步步3D生成中达到优异性能

Abstract: Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps
during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly
Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in
accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex
3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for
few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:
distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly
learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this
integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two
optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),
to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the
velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns
to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but
inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)
further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity
fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the
pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of
each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s
(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables
TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

Conclusion: Durian通过创新的双参考网络设计和训练策略，实现了零样本高保真肖像动画生成，为多属性组合提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos
with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target
portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially
consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference
networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute
images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model
using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the
same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as
the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on
these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of
attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy
using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we
further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and
appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional
misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively
generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,
despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves
state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and
notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a
single generation pass without additional training.

Abstract: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest
(ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of
collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital
radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray
radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms
polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep
learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We
achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to
detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the
information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information
of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained
segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions
achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real
Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our
method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.

Abstract: Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception,
omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field
of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as
virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their
unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective
images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,
making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This
survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on
the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging
pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for
analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of
domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform
sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.
Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300
research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method
analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific
challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task
comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual
quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal
understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges
and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the
advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new
insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of
panoramic vision technologies. Our project page is

Motivation: 随着文本到图像扩散模型在创意领域的应用增加，需要提供增强的控制、精炼和生成后修改能力，同时保持多帧间的视觉和叙事一致性。现有方法缺乏在保持一致性前提下进行精细或粗粒度编辑的灵活性。

Method: 提出了Plot'n Polish零样本框架，能够在不同细节层次上对故事可视化进行细粒度控制，支持一致的故事生成和编辑。

Result: 该框架能够实现一致的故事可视化生成，并提供灵活的编辑控制能力，解决了现有方法在保持多帧一致性方面的不足。

Conclusion: Plot'n Polish为解决故事可视化中的一致性和控制问题提供了一个有效的零样本解决方案，有助于创作者无缝地制作和精炼视觉故事。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated significant capabilities to
generate diverse and detailed visuals in various domains, and story
visualization is emerging as a particularly promising application. However, as
their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing
enhanced control, refinement, and the ability to modify images post-generation
in a consistent manner becomes an important challenge. Existing methods often
lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and
narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing creators from
seamlessly crafting and refining their visual stories. To address these
challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables
consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story
visualizations at various levels of detail.

TL;DR: TRUST-VL是一个统一的、可解释的视觉语言模型，用于多模态虚假信息检测，通过联合训练和结构化推理链实现优异的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态虚假信息（包含文本、视觉和跨模态扭曲）对社会威胁日益严重，现有方法通常只关注单一扭曲类型且难以泛化到未见场景。

Method: 提出TRUST-VL模型，包含问题感知视觉放大器模块提取任务特定视觉特征，构建TRUST-Instruct指令数据集（198K样本）包含结构化推理链。

Result: 在域内和零样本基准测试中达到最先进性能，展现出强大的泛化能力和可解释性。

Conclusion: 联合训练不同扭曲类型促进了知识共享，增强了模型的泛化能力，TRUST-VL为多模态虚假信息检测提供了有效的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal
distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by
generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion
and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that
different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also
requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across
distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability
to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable
vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL
incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to
extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct
TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples
featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking
workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks
demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also
offering strong generalization and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统虚拟试穿视频生成需要大量计算资源和长视频数据，且难以生成任意长度的视频。VFR旨在解决这些问题，实现高效、灵活的长视频生成。

Method: 采用分段自回归生成方法，使用前缀视频条件确保局部平滑性，通过360度锚点视频保持全局时间一致性。

Result: 能够生成分钟级别的虚拟试穿视频，在各种动作下都保持局部平滑和全局时间一致性。

Conclusion: VFR是长虚拟试穿视频生成领域的开创性工作，为任意长度视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model
that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video
generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process,
eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data,
while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key
challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent
segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments.
To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures
smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the
anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's
wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with
both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions,
making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.

Motivation: 美国过半数阿尔茫海默病患者未被诊断，语音基础的筛查提供了可扩展的检测方案。

Method: 使用DementiaBank语音语料库，评估了九个纯文本模型和三个多模态音频-文本模型，测试了各种适配策略包括上下文学习、推理增强提示、参数效率微调和多模态整合。

Result: 类质心示例获得最高的上下文学习性能，推理提示改善了小模型的表现，标记级微调通常产生最佳分数。多模态模型表现良好但未超越最佳纯文本模型。

Conclusion: 模型适配策略（包括示例选择、推理设计和调整方法）对语音基础的耻病检测至关重要，适当适配的开源模型可以达到或超越商业系统的性能。

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain
undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach.
We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection
using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and
three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech
corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration
selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid
demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning
improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the
best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved
underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems
performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings
highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection,
reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia
detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed
commercial systems.

Conclusion: RBA框架能够显著缩小语音大语言模型与文本大语言模型之间的性能差距，为多模态语言模型的发展提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred
considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities
beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs
(SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or
textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs
still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM
counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the
dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA),
designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead
of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a
self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data
by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of
a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following
capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines.
Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such
including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining
state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data.

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency
news using a fine-tuned Mistral 7B large language model with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and
text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of
summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets
of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into
comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides
complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit
quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency
news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language
model hallucinations.
  The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM
models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative
qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.

Conclusion: 该系统不仅在财务报告领域有实用价值，还可扩展到医疗电话、教育和政治话语等其他高风险半卷话沟通领域，提供了健壮且可解释的多模态话语表征方法。

Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of
financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with
unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment
analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal
tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,
failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This
paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate
semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by
encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a
monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived
from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence
scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer
architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse
metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second
synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results
reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful
representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic
alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other
high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,
and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to
multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility
for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation,
while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains
involving high-stakes communication.

Motivation: 青少年自杀是主要死因之一，但预测困难。许多案例因缺乏精神健康服务接触而未被发现。社交媒体提供了实时分析青少年在线表达的机会。

Method: 提出Early-SIB模型，使用transformer结构序列处理用户发布和互动的论坛帖子，在用户明确表达自杀意念前预测其自杀风险。

Result: 在荷兰青年论坛数据上，模型预测未来自杀意念和行为的平衡准确率达到0.73。

Conclusion: 这种早期预测方法可以作为传统方法的有力补充，为青少年自杀防治提供新的应用前景。

Abstract: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting
it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of
contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique
opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in
real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it:
predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an
adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This
predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage,
remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end,
we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes
the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a
SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future
SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a
meaningful addition to traditional methods.

Conclusion: 这是一种有前景的新方法，能够实现可扩展的实时假写检测，并且在不同模型间具有转移能力

Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications
where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or
legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are
impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual
queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable
method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form
generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach
targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,
citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level
labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology
that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels
indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables
us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient
methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our
classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including
more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for
Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering
settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our
probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,
indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is
expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train
effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our
datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new
approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

Conclusion: UDIB为语义分歧检测框架提供了更优越的基础，提供了检测LLM幻觉的新颖且更敏感的工具

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including
\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),
where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks
designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on
identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by
applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a
disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the
downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the
Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key
contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for
high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a
computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,
can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means
that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By
applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we
generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent
but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the
prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM
framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

Motivation: 现有代码生成LLM主要关注表面模式识别，缺乏对抽象能力的显式训练，而抽象是计算机科学中识别和提炼核心计算模式的关键技能

Method: 提出AR²对抗性强化学习框架：教师模型将内核问题转化为叙述丰富的挑战性描述（不改变基本逻辑），学生编码模型训练解决这些复杂叙述问题并提取底层计算内核

Result: 实验结果表明AR²显著提高了学生模型在先前未见挑战性编程任务上的准确性

Conclusion: 抽象是增强LLM泛化能力的关键技能，AR²框架有效提升了LLM的抽象推理能力

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational
patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer
science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large
language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code
generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus
primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for
abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to
enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to
transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without
changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is
trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their
underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$
substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen,
challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for
enhancing LLM generalization.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by
incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time.
However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which
limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual
inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework
that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during
inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external
information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a
seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using
the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through
external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We
evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating
consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and
interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our
findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction
for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable
manner.

Abstract: Understanding how scientific ideas evolve requires more than summarizing
individual papers-it demands structured, cross-document reasoning over
thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document
scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation,
methodology, and experimental results across related papers to reconstruct
research development chains. This task introduces key challenges, including
temporally aligning loosely structured methods and standardizing heterogeneous
experimental tables. We present ResearchPulse, an agent-based framework that
integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured
visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task
decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a
Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task,
we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper
clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents,
consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment,
structural consistency, and visual fidelity. The dataset are available in

TL;DR: 传统OCR系统Sprinklr-Edge-OCR在边缘部署场景中优于大型视觉语言模型，在效率、成本和F1分数方面表现最佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言、嘈杂和多样化真实世界图像中的OCR挑战，特别是在资源受限的边缘部署环境中

Method: 对5个先进LVLM和2个传统OCR系统进行大规模比较评估，使用包含54种语言的双重人工标注数据集，涵盖准确性、语义一致性、语言覆盖、计算效率和部署成本等指标

Result: Qwen获得最高精度(0.54)，Sprinklr-Edge-OCR获得最佳F1分数(0.46)，处理速度快35倍(平均0.17秒/图像)，成本仅为LVLM的0.01(每1000张图像0.006美元)

Conclusion: 在边缘部署场景中，传统OCR系统由于计算需求低、延迟低和成本极低，仍然是最优选择，即使在LLM时代也是如此

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse
real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character
recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond
fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR
system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five
state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two
traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly
hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark
covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,
language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and
deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted
edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only
environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),
while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and
outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds
per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000
images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR
systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs
due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high
affordability.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现LLM作为自动评估器存在"自我偏好偏差"问题，并提出使用轻量级导向向量在推理时缓解此偏差，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型作为自动评估器时存在自我偏好偏差，倾向于偏爱自己的输出而非其他模型的输出，这影响了评估管道的公平性和可靠性。

Method: 构建区分合理与不合理自我偏好的数据集，使用对比激活加法(CAA)和基于优化的方法构建导向向量，在推理时进行干预。

Result: 导向向量能将不合理自我偏好偏差减少高达97%，显著优于提示和直接偏好优化基线方法，但在合理自我偏好和无偏同意方面表现不稳定。

Conclusion: 导向向量作为LLM作为评判者的安全保障措施具有前景但也存在局限，自我偏好可能涉及多个或非线性方向，需要更稳健的干预方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet
they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs
over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in
evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model
routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this
problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset
that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of
self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct
steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and
an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can
reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially
outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet
steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased
agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.
This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges
and motivates more robust interventions.

TL;DR: 通过分析SNOMED CT概念的共现模式和语义向量相似性，研究发现语义嵌入能够捕捉临床意义关联，并可用于补充临床注释和症状分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记包含丰富的临床叙事，但非结构化格式给大规模分析带来挑战。需要探索SNOMED CT标准术语的共现模式与语义相似性之间的关系。

Method: 利用MIMIC-IV数据库，使用标准化相互信息(NPMI)和预训练向量嵌入(ClinicalBERT、BioBERT)分析SNOMED CT概念的共现模式与语义相似性。

Result: 共现模式与语义相似性弱相关，但嵌入能捕捉临床意义关联；嵌入建议的概念经常与后期文档匹配；概念聚类形成了一致的临床主题；共现模式与汽亡率等结果相关。

Conclusion: 共现统计和语义嵌入具有补充价值，可用于改善文档完整性、揭示潜在临床关系和支持决策支持与症状分析。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format
poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as
SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate
through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this
study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship
between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic
similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained
embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently
co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can
suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and
across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic
similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful
associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based
suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their
utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings
yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular
conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally,
co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission
demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings
highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic
embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical
relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

Motivation: 解决立场检测中跨目标和跨领域的迁移学习挑战，传统方法在新目标领域表现不佳，需要更好的领域适应能力

Method: 使用度量学习和三元组损失来捕捉立场目标间的语义相似性和差异，构建判别性嵌入空间，使模型能够从新目标领域获取有用示例

Result: 在两个数据集上的多个跨目标和跨域场景中评估，对六个广泛使用的立场检测模型都显示出统计显著的性能提升

Conclusion: MLSD方法通过度量学习有效提升了跨域立场检测的性能，为少样本学习场景下的立场检测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We present the novel approach for stance detection across domains and
targets, Metric Learning-Based Few-Shot Learning for Cross-Target and
Cross-Domain Stance Detection (MLSD). MLSD utilizes metric learning with
triplet loss to capture semantic similarities and differences between stance
targets, enhancing domain adaptation. By constructing a discriminative
embedding space, MLSD allows a cross-target or cross-domain stance detection
model to acquire useful examples from new target domains. We evaluate MLSD in
multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios across two datasets, showing
statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across
six widely used stance detection models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SiLVERScore，一种基于语义感知嵌入的手语生成评估指标，直接在联合嵌入空间中评估手语，避免了传统反向翻译评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手语生成评估采用反向翻译方法，存在两个主要问题：无法捕捉手语的多模态特性（如面部表情、空间语法和韵律），以及难以区分评估错误是来自生成模型还是翻译系统。

Method: 开发SiLVERScore指标，在联合嵌入空间中进行语义感知评估，能够处理语义和韵律变化，并探索跨数据集的泛化挑战。

Result: 在PHOENIX-14T和CSL-Daily数据集上，SiLVERScore实现了近乎完美的正确与随机对区分能力（ROC AUC = 0.99，重叠率 < 7%），显著优于传统指标。

Conclusion: SiLVERScore提供了一个更准确、更直接的手语生成评估方法，能够更好地捕捉手语的多模态特性，解决了传统评估方法的模糊性问题。

Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,
where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a
reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline
introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of
sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also
makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation
model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose
SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that
assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions
include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing
SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness
to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization
challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore
achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC
= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个四指标的评估框架，用于系统性地评估大规模视觉语言模型（VLM）在交互式基础设置中的表现，发现当前VLM在基础过程中与人类行为存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的测试框架主要在单轮或问答场景中评估VLM，而基础是一个交互过程，需要通过持续沟通形成共享理解。需要一个更全面的评估方法来分析VLM在交互式基础中的表现。

Method: 提出四指标评估套件：基础效率、内容对齐、词汇适应性和人类相似度。在150个自我对战会话中，让三个专有VLM进行交互式指示游戏，并与人类对比。

Result: 三个模型都在至少三个指标上呈现出与人类不同的模式，GPT4o-mini整体最接近人类。发现：（1）任务成功度不能代表成功基础；（2）高图像-语句对齐度不一定预测任务成功。

Conclusion: 该指标套件和发现为未来VLM基础研究提供了一个重要的评估框架，强调了需要更全面的指标来评估模型在交互式场景中的真实表现。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet
current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings.
However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop
shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric
suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and
human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive
grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of
interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them
with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least
three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task
success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high
image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric
suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文档级机器翻译中表现出色，但其整文档输出挑战了传统的句子级对齐评估方法，需要新的评估框架。

Method: 1. Align阶段：自动推断句子级源-目标对应关系，重建目标文本以匹配源语句数量；2. n-Chunk滑动评估阶段：计算1-4个chunk的平均度量分数进行多粒度评估。

Result: 在WMT基准测试中与专家MQM排名的Pearson相关性达到0.929；在新构建的真实测试集上与人工判断高度一致；产生的偏好数据可用于CPO训练和GRPO奖励模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为文档级机器翻译系统提供了准确、鲁棒且可操作的评估工具，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level
machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs
challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence
alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete
evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we
automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild
the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and
many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we
calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for
multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson
correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly
curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human
judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables
effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both
yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results
validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool
for doc-mt systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的句子级音频深度伪造检测无法定位伪造片段的具体位置，而现有的部分音频深度伪造检测方法未能充分利用音频中的语义信息，特别是命名实体信息。

Method: 提出NE-PADD方法，包含两个并行分支：语音命名实体识别(SpeechNER)和部分音频深度伪造检测(PADD)，采用注意力融合(AF)和注意力转移(AT)两种注意力聚合机制，通过辅助损失利用命名实体语义指导检测。

Result: 在PartialSpoof-NER数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 整合命名实体知识对部分音频深度伪造检测具有显著效果，证明了语义信息在此任务中的重要性。

Abstract: Different from traditional sentence-level audio deepfake detection (ADD),
partial audio deepfake detection (PADD) requires frame-level positioning of the
location of fake speech. While some progress has been made in this area,
leveraging semantic information from audio, especially named entities, remains
an underexplored aspect. To this end, we propose NE-PADD, a novel method for
Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that leverages named entity knowledge
through two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and
PADD. The approach incorporates two attention aggregation mechanisms: Attention
Fusion (AF) for combining attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for
guiding PADD with named entity semantics using an auxiliary loss. Built on the
PartialSpoof-NER dataset, experiments show our method outperforms existing
baselines, proving the effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in
PADD. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/NE-PADD.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了'废话学'(Drivelology)概念，指表面无意义但蕴含深层含义的语言现象。研究发现当前大语言模型无法理解这种多层次语义，构建了包含1200+多语言样本的数据集进行测试，揭示了LLMs在语用理解上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型虽然在许多NLP任务上表现出色，但对于那些语法连贯但语用矛盾、情感丰富或修辞颠覆的'废话学'文本存在理解困难，需要探究这种深层次语义理解的局限性。

Method: 构建了包含1200多个精心筛选的多语言(英、中、西、法、日、韩)废话学样本数据集，经过多轮专家评审和裁决。评估了多种LLMs在分类、生成和推理任务上的表现。

Result: LLMs经常将废话学与浅层无意义文本混淆，产生不连贯的辩解，或完全忽略隐含的修辞功能，显示出在语用理解方面存在深层次的表征差距。

Conclusion: 统计流畅性并不等同于认知理解能力，LLMs在理解超越表面连贯性的语言深度方面存在明显局限，需要进一步研究如何建模这种深层次语言理解。

Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as
"nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet
pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.
While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode
implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional
interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite
excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to
grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we
construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously
curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,
Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the
examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected
Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of
discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle
and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on
classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear
limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,
produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function
altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'
pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency
implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate
further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

Conclusion: 本研究为AI安全社区提供了关于推理可信度最新进展的宝贵资源，强调了在推进推理技术的同时必须关注其安全风险，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across
various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and
code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate
reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,
despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based
reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains
underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and
CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:
truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we
provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological
order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and
limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for
reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for
enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful
content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models
themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in
safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this
work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to
stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness. A full list

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型可能遵循有害指令引发安全隐患，现有研究使用探测方法分析恶意和良性输入在模型内部表示的可分离性，但作者发现这些方法在分布外性能表现不佳，怀疑其学习的是表面模式而非语义危害性。

Method: 通过控制实验系统验证假设：首先展示简单n-gram方法的可比性能，然后使用语义清理数据集进行控制实验，最后详细分析模式依赖性。

Result: 确认探测方法确实学习的是表面模式（指令模式和触发词），而非语义危害性，揭示了当前探测方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 当前基于探测的方法存在虚假安全感问题，需要重新设计模型和评估协议，为负责任的安全研究方向提供建议。作者已开源相关项目。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising
serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has
leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and
benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed
using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine
this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we
hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic
harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and
identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger
words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from
demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled
experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern
dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current
probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and
evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of
suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating
nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large
language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These
agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically
assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,
current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can
lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack
interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app
cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each
instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and
correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,
a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly
and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence
mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of
MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark
characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require
external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval
demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving
10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

TL;DR: 知识图三元组和原始文本构建知识单元，通过矩阵思维结构和事实纠正机制提升复杂问答性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在复杂抽象问题回答中的推理能力不足问题，充分利用多实体多跳轮的大量信息

Method: 提出矩阵思维（MoT）结构，通过“列-单元通信”机制在水平和垂直维度进行多策略深层思考，并构建知识单元实现事实纠正

Result: 在四个广泛使用数据集上超过最新方法，F1和EM指标都有提升，推理时间仅为基准方法的14.4%

Conclusion: MoT结构通过多维度思考和知识纠正，有效提升了复杂问题回答的准确性和效率

Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they
suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and
abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning
abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures
and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the
challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving
multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the
Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT
explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the
"column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in
multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column
cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a
fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved
knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM
reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an
efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in
terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline
methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this
framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KPoEM是一个用于现代韩语诗歌情感分析的新数据集，包含7662个标注条目和44种细粒度情感类别，通过微调韩语大模型显著提升了诗歌情感分类性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在文本情感分类方面取得显著进展，但由于诗歌的比喻性语言和文化特殊性，韩语诗歌的情感分析仍然研究不足，需要专门的数据集和方法

Method: 构建包含7662个条目的多标签情感数据集（7007行级和615作品级），使用44种细粒度情感类别标注，采用顺序微调策略：先在通用语料上预训练，再在KPoEM数据集上微调

Result: 在KPoEM数据集上微调的韩语模型显著优于之前模型，F1-micro达到0.60（相比通用语料训练的0.34），能够更好地识别时间和文化特定的情感表达

Conclusion: 该研究连接了计算方法和文学分析，通过结构化数据为诗歌情感的定量探索提供了新可能性，忠实地保留了韩国文学的情感和文化细微差别

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset
for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable
progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,
poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative
language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of
7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615
work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five
influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned
on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60
F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM
model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then
on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify
temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong
capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study
bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new
possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through
structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of
Korean literature.

TL;DR: SelfAug是一种自分布对齐方法，通过在RAG微调中保持模型语义分布来缓解灾难性遗忘，在保持通用能力的同时提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调方法在RAG场景中虽然能提升任务特定性能，但会导致灾难性遗忘问题，使模型失去原有知识和通用能力。现有解决方案要么需要通用指令数据，要么在保持模型原始分布方面存在局限。

Method: 提出SelfAug自分布对齐方法，通过将输入序列logits对齐来保持模型的语义分布，从而缓解灾难性遗忘并改善下游性能。

Result: 大量实验表明，SelfAug在下游学习和通用能力保持之间实现了优越的平衡。实证分析揭示了分布偏移与RAG场景中灾难性遗忘严重程度之间的直接相关性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅推进了对RAG背景下灾难性遗忘的理解，还提供了一个适用于各种微调场景的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPFT-SQL是一种针对Text-to-SQL任务的自博弈微调方法，通过验证驱动的迭代微调和错误驱动损失机制，解决了传统SPIN方法在SQL生成中的局限性，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自博弈微调(SPIN)方法在Text-to-SQL任务中存在局限性：无法生成新信息，且对手模型产生的大量正确SQL查询会降低主模型生成准确SQL的能力。

Method: 提出SPFT-SQL方法：1）自博弈前采用验证驱动的迭代微调，基于数据库模式和验证反馈合成高质量数据；2）自博弈阶段使用错误驱动损失机制，激励对手模型的错误输出，帮助主模型区分正确和错误SQL。

Result: 在6个开源大语言模型和5个广泛使用的基准测试上的实验表明，该方法优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: SPFT-SQL方法有效解决了Text-to-SQL任务中自博弈微调的挑战，通过创新的验证驱动和错误驱动机制显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which
can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through
competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces
challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and
the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during
self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To
address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored
for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a
verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes
high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and
validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base
with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose
an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the
opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and
erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to
generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six
open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: VoxRole是首个专门用于评估语音角色扮演对话代理的综合性基准，包含13335个多轮对话、65.6小时语音数据，涵盖1228个独特角色，解决了该领域缺乏标准化评估基准的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前角色扮演对话代理研究存在两个主要局限：一是主要关注文本模态，忽略了语音中的副语言特征（语调、韵律、节奏等）；二是缺乏标准化的评估基准，现有语音对话数据集无法有效量化模型在长期角色一致性等核心能力上的表现。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的两阶段自动化流程：首先将电影音频与剧本对齐，然后使用大语言模型系统地为每个角色构建多维配置文件，最终构建了包含13335个多轮对话的VoxRole基准数据集。

Result: 基于VoxRole基准对当代语音对话模型进行了多维评估，揭示了这些模型在保持角色一致性方面的各自优势和局限性。

Conclusion: VoxRole填补了语音角色扮演对话代理评估领域的空白，为未来研究提供了重要的标准化评估工具，有助于推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly
propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These
systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona
adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,
existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely
overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and
rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and
shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers
from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current
spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,
featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they
fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like
long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce
VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the
evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn
dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261
movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated
pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an
LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.
Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary
spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective
strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

TL;DR: CANDY是一个用于评估大语言模型在中文虚假信息事实核查方面能力的基准测试，包含约2万个标注实例。研究发现当前LLMs在事实核查方面存在局限，即使使用思维链和少样本提示也难以生成准确结论。虽然LLMs单独使用时不可靠，但作为辅助工具具有提升人类性能的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在中文虚假信息事实核查方面的能力和局限性，尽管LLMs使用日益广泛，但其事实核查效果仍不确定。

Method: 构建CANDY基准测试，包含约20,000个精心标注的中文虚假信息实例。使用思维链推理和少样本提示技术增强LLMs，并开发分类法对LLM生成的错误解释进行分类。

Result: 当前LLMs在生成准确事实核查结论方面存在明显局限，即使使用增强技术。事实捏造是最常见的失败模式。LLMs单独使用时不可靠，但作为辅助工具可以显著提升人类性能。

Conclusion: 大语言模型目前还不能独立可靠地进行事实核查，但在作为人类辅助工具的场景中具有重要价值。CANDY基准为系统评估LLMs的事实核查能力提供了重要资源。

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check
misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we
present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities
and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically,
we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows
that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking
conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot
prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize
flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual
fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable
for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to
augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios. Our
dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY

Motivation: 大语言模型在极低资源语言上效果差，特别是缘于危的拉丁语言，缺乏高质量标注数据集

Method: 利用少量并行拉丁-意大利语句对，通过翻译单语意大利语数据生成合成数据集，应用严格过滤和反向翻译检验

Result: 创建了首个公开的拉丁语情感分析和多选题答案数据集，并在机器翻译训练中实现显著改进

Conclusion: 为不充分代表的语言提供了基础性NLP资源，支持更广泛的语言技术研究和应用开发

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely
low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack
of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality
natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited,
making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper
addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language,
specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of
parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for
sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating
monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we
apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We
further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine
translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing
Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first
publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing
foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream
applications for this underrepresented language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时态知识图问答方法主要关注隐式时态约束，缺乏处理复杂时态查询的能力，分解框架中遇到推理能力有限和错误传播问题。

Method: RTQA框架包含三个核心组件：时态问题分解器、递归求解器和答案聚合器。通过递归思维方式将问题分解为子问题，使用大语言模型和时态知识图知识底向上解决，并采用多路径答案聚合提高故障容耗性。

Result: 在MultiTQ和TimelineKGQA标准数据集上进行实验，RTQA在"Multiple"和"Complex"类别中实现了显著的Hits@1提升，超越了现有最优方法。

Conclusion: RTQA框架通过递归分解和多路径聚合机制，有效解决了复杂时态查询的挑战，提供了一种无需训练的高效时态知识图问答方案。

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily
focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more
complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and
error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel
framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without
requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes
questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG
knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault
tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question
Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on
MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements
in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<details>

Motivation: 现实应用涉及语言变异性，需要模型在不同措辞的相同问题中保持有效性，但现有基准评估使用固定标准化格式的问题，可能无法可靠衡量模型能力。

Method: 系统生成六个常见基准中所有问题的各种改写版本，测量34个最先进LLM在不同大小和性能下的有效性变化。

Result: LLM在改写输入下的排名相对稳定，但绝对有效性得分发生变化且显著下降，表明模型难以应对语言变异性。

Conclusion: 研究结果对LLM评估方法提出挑战，强调需要开发更能反映实际部署场景的鲁棒性感知基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of
benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in
their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,
real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to
maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or
query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to
paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based
evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically
generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common
benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34
state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal
that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,
absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests
that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their
generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the
observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a
model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications
of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for
robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely
applied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks
across various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system
based on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which
significantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To
fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model
for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).
The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus
and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset
for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based
on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1
score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative
models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core
syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C).
Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with
imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with
attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated
Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent
studies.

Conclusion: 首次提出基于音乐理论合成谱面问题的思路，不仅提升了模型对谱面的理解能力，还为AI辅助音乐创作开启了新可能性

Abstract: Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward
building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation
benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we
propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,
which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data
synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both
textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning
Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on
SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting
sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro
highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in
a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and
Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the
trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on
MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with
the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on
math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base.
Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also
facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the
idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and
demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet
music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted
music creation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文对教育领域的阿拉伯语聊天机器人进行了综述性研究，分析了现有系统的技术方法、语言变体和性能指标，并指出了阿拉伯语教育聊天机器在现代技术采用方面的研究空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能和自然语言处理技术的进步以及COVID-19大流行期间对远程访问技术的需求增长，促使聊天机器在教育等领域广泛应用。虽然英语聊天机器取得了成功，但阿拉伯语教育聊天机器的现代技术应用仍少，需要系统性研究。

Method: 采用综述研究方法，对现有阿拉伯语教育聊天机器进行调查分析，重点考察其所采用的技术方法、支持的语言变体以及性能评估指标。

Result: 研究发现，虽然阿拉伯语聊天机器在教育领域有一些应用，但与英语等语言相比，采用现代大语言模型（如BERT、GPT等）的阿拉伯语教育聊天机器还很少，存在明显的技术巡沿。

Conclusion: 本研究系统地识别了阿拉伯语教育聊天机器领域的研究空白和挑战，并提出了未来研究方向，为推动阿拉伯语聊天机器在教育领域更广泛采用现代AI技术提供了重要指引。

Abstract: The recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, and in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular, and some of its applications
such as chatbots, have led to their implementation in different domains like
education, healthcare, tourism, and customer service. Since the COVID-19
pandemic, there has been an increasing interest in these digital technologies
to allow and enhance remote access. In education, e-learning systems have been
massively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such
as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this
study, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their
different characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and
metrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some
research gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other
languages such as English, only a few educational Arabic chatbots used modern
techniques. Finally, we discuss future directions of research in this field.

*Rishit Tyagi,Rahul Bouri,Mohit Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个结合BERT分类和GPT-4o推理的系统，用于检测新闻中的隐蔽叙事并生成基于证据的解释，通过辅助知识库提高准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NLP方法难以检测新闻中的微妙措辞和隐藏议程，需要解决多标签叙事分类和生成基于证据的解释这两个关键挑战。

Method: 使用召回导向的BERT模型进行叙事检测，结合GPT-4o管道优化预测一致性；采用ReACT框架进行语义检索的少样本提示，并引入结构化分类表作为辅助知识库来减少幻觉。

Result: 集成辅助知识的提示方法提高了分类准确性和解释可靠性，在媒体分析、教育和情报收集等领域具有应用价值。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了隐蔽叙事检测和解释生成的挑战，通过知识增强的提示策略显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Understanding covert narratives and implicit messaging is essential for
analyzing bias and sentiment. Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting
subtle phrasing and hidden agendas. This study tackles two key challenges: (1)
multi-label classification of narratives and sub-narratives in news articles,
and (2) generating concise, evidence-based explanations for dominant
narratives. We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for
comprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline
for consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +
Acting) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring
grounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce
hallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary
knowledge base. Our results show that integrating auxiliary knowledge in
prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, with
applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这研究探索了如何为对话机器人构建稳定的个性化词汇模型，以支持词汇对齐能力。研究发现使用10分钟转写语音数据和精简的词汇配置可以在性能和数据效率之间取得最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 词汇对齐能够促进成功沟通，但在大语言模型新进展背景下，对话机器人中的词汇对齐实现仍然研究不足。本研究作为启动步骤，通过构建稳定的个性化词汇模型来为词汇对齐提供基础。

Method: 研究变化了用于构建词汇模型的转写语音数据量，以及各词性类别中包含的词汇项目数量。使用回归率、覆盖率和余弦相似度指标来评估模型在时间上的性能。

Result: 研究发现较小且更紧凑的词汇模型表现最佳，具体为：使用10分钟转写语音数据，其中形容词和连词各90个项目，副词、名词、代词和动词各10个项目。这种配置在性能和数据效率之间取得了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 本研究为构建稳定的个性化词汇模型提供了实用的见解，考虑了最小数据需求，是开发对话机器人词汇对齐策略的基础步骤。

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across
conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its
implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly
considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first
step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study
draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates
the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for
lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken
data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the
profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance
across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown
that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed
speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10
items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in
both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers
practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles,
taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step
toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

the questions are of good quality. We evaluate 6 different language models,
both decoder and encoder models of varying sizes, showing that the benchmark is
sufficiently difficult and that there is a large performance discrepancy
amongst the languages. The dataset and survey evaluations are freely available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连贯性建模研究大多只关注实体特征或话语关系特征，很少将两者结合起来，需要探索同时建模这两种特征的方法。

Method: 提出了两种联合建模实体和话语关系的方法，在三个基准数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，整合实体和话语关系特征显著提升了连贯性模型的性能表现。

Conclusion: 同时建模实体和话语关系对于连贯性评估具有重要价值，联合建模方法能有效提升模型效果。

Abstract: In linguistics, coherence can be achieved by different means, such as by
maintaining reference to the same set of entities across sentences and by
establishing discourse relations between them. However, most existing work on
coherence modeling focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse
relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this
study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse
relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets
show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the
performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both
simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

TL;DR: MAGneT是一种新的多模型框架，通过将心理咨询回复生成分解为多个专门的子任务，每个任务由专门的LLM模型处理具体心理技术，以生成高质量的合成心理咨询数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决心理咨询领域高质量、隐私合规数据稀缺的问题，以支持开源大语言模型的精细调整需求。

Method: 提出MAGneT多模型框架，将咨询师回复生成分解为多个协调的子任务，每个任务由专门的LLM模型处理具体心理技术；同时提出统一的评估框架，将专家评估从四个方面扩展到九个方面。

Result: MAGneT在生成的咨询会话质量、多样性和治疗对齐方面显著超过现有方法，一般咨询技能提高3.2%，CBT特定技能提高4.3%；专家在77.2%的情况下偏好MAGneT生成的会话；使用MAGneT数据微调模型表现更佳，一般咨询技能提高6.3%，CBT特定技能提高7.3%。

Conclusion: MAGneT框架能够生成高质量的合成心理咨询数据，有效解决了该领域高质量数据稀缺的问题，为开源大语言模型的精细调整提供了可靠的数据支持。

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need
for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality,
privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT,
a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session
generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated
sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological
technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the
structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address
inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation
framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we
expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works
to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data
quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing
methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated
counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and
CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale
(CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases
on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on
MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3%
on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS
over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make
our code and data public.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体事件检测依赖标注数据，但人工标注成本高且费时，需要解决数据稀缺问题

Method: 双增强框架：显式增强使用大语言模型进行5种文本生成策略；隐式增强设计5种新颖的特征空间扰动技术，在结构融合嵌入上操作以保持语义和关系属性

Result: 在Twitter2012数据集上平均F1分数比最佳基线模型提升约17.67%，在Twitter2018数据集上提升约15.57%

Conclusion: SED-Aug框架有效增强了数据多样性和模型鲁棒性，显著提升了社交媒体事件检测性能

Abstract: Social event detection involves identifying and categorizing important events
from social media, which relies on labeled data, but annotation is costly and
labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose Augmentation framework for
Social Event Detection (SED-Aug), a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework,
which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to
enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes
large language models to enhance textual information through five diverse
generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel
perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused
embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational
properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug
outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012
dataset and by about 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of the average
F1 score. The code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/congboma/SED-Aug.

TL;DR: 提出了Inverse IFEval基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在对抗性指令下的反直觉能力，发现现有模型存在认知惯性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在监督微调后往往表现出认知惯性，难以遵循与训练模式相冲突的指令，需要评估和解决这一局限性。

Method: 构建包含1012个中英文问题的数据集，涵盖8种对抗性挑战类型，采用人类参与的数据构建流程和优化的LLM-as-a-Judge评估框架。

Result: 实验表明现有领先LLMs在反直觉能力方面存在不足，验证了Inverse IFEval基准的必要性。

Conclusion: 未来的对齐工作不仅要追求流畅性和事实正确性，还应考虑模型在非常规情境下的适应性，Inverse IFEval可作为诊断工具和改进方法的基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on diverse tasks but
often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to follow instructions that
conflict with the standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that
measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override
training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse
IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question
Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and
Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a
dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains,
evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing
leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval
benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only
pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under
unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a
diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive
inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the
instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable
real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 该研究创建了两个医学问答数据集来评估大语言模型在医学知识更新方面的表现，发现所有模型都存在依赖过时知识的问题，并分析了原因和提出了改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在医疗领域有巨大潜力，但其依赖静态训练数据的特性可能导致提供过时的医学建议，存在安全隐患。需要系统评估模型对医学知识更新的适应能力。

Method: 构建了两个新颖的医学问答数据集：MedRevQA（16,501个QA对，涵盖一般生物医学知识）和MedChangeQA（512个QA对，专门针对医学共识随时间变化的案例）。评估了8个主流大语言模型在这些数据集上的表现。

Result: 所有评估的大语言模型都表现出对过时知识的一致依赖，无法有效适应医学共识的变化。研究还分析了过时预训练数据和训练策略对这一现象的影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前大语言模型在医学知识更新方面的局限性，为开发更及时可靠的医疗AI系统奠定了基础，并提出了未来缓解这一问题的方向。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant
potential to enhance healthcare by assisting medical researchers and
physicians. However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk
when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When
LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or
fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two
novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews:
MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and
MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over
time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals
consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally
analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to
explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying
the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.

*Jiajun He,Naoki Sawada,Koichi Miyazaki,Tomoki Toda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARCO提出了一种增强的上下文ASR方法，通过音素感知编码、对比实体消歧、实体级监督和分层实体过滤，显著提升了特定领域命名实体（特别是同音词）的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR系统在处理领域特定命名实体（尤其是同音词）时表现不佳，上下文ASR方法由于实体多样性有限和将实体作为独立标记处理，导致无法捕捉细粒度音素变化和完整的多标记偏置。

Method: PARCO方法集成了四个关键组件：音素感知编码、对比实体消歧、实体级监督和分层实体过滤，这些组件共同增强了音素区分能力，确保完整实体检索，并在不确定性下减少误报。

Result: 实验结果显示，PARCO在中文AISHELL-1上达到4.22%的CER，在英文DATA2上达到11.14%的WER（1000个干扰项条件下），显著优于基线方法，并在THCHS-30和LibriSpeech等域外数据集上表现出稳健的性能提升。

Conclusion: PARCO通过综合的音素增强和上下文处理机制，有效解决了ASR系统中命名实体识别的问题，特别是在处理同音词和多标记实体方面表现出色，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with domain-specific
named entities, especially homophones. Contextual ASR improves recognition but
often fails to capture fine-grained phoneme variations due to limited entity
diversity. Moreover, prior methods treat entities as independent tokens,
leading to incomplete multi-token biasing. To address these issues, we propose
Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation
(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity
disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.
These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity
retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that
PARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English
DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO
also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and
LibriSpeech.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM性别偏见评估的脆弱性，即使微小的提示词变化也能显著改变偏见测量结果，甚至完全逆转偏见方向。离散选择指标相比概率指标会放大偏见，这引发了关于测试设计生态效度的新问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会影响场景中的广泛应用，性别偏见问题日益受到关注。当前评估方法通常使用与自然语言分布不同的构造任务提示，这些提示会明示或暗示性别偏见相关内容的存在，研究者希望了解这种评估目的的信号如何影响LLM性别偏见的测量结果。

Method: 研究测试了在不同提示条件下的模型表现：(1)使测试情境显著化，(2)使性别相关内容显著化。在四种任务格式中使用token概率和离散选择两种指标评估提示敏感性。

Result: 即使微小的提示变化也能显著改变偏见结果，有时甚至完全逆转偏见方向。离散选择指标倾向于比概率指标放大偏见。

Conclusion: 研究结果不仅揭示了LLM性别偏见评估的脆弱性，还为NLP基准测试和开发社区提出了新难题：良好控制的测试设计在多大程度上会触发LLM的"测试模式"性能，这对未来基准测试的生态效度意味着什么。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns
about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate
such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from
natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed
task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender
bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative
purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test
models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and
(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity
across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice
metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias
outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics
further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings
do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a
new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent
can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance,
and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统评估了开源语言模型在日历历法转换和运算任务中的表现，发现即使日语中心模型也在日本历法处理方面存在困难，强调了发展具有文化特定历法理解能力的语言模型的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然之前的研究已分析和改善了语言模型的时态推理能力，但大多数研究仅聚焦于公历。实际上，日本历、伊斯兰历和希伯来历等非公历系统仍在活跃使用，体现了文化基础的时间概念。目前尚无研究评估当前语言模型如何处理这类非公历系统。

Method: 研究为了评估语言模型在日本历法上的表现，创建了四个需要时态知识和时态推理的任务数据集，并对一系列英语中心和日语中心的开源语言模型进行了系统评估。

Result: 评测结果显示，一些模型能够进行历法转换，但即使是日语中心的模型也在日本历法算术和保持不同历法之间一致性方面面临困难。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了发展具有更好文化特定历法理解能力的语言模型的重要性，以支持更广泛的文化和语言需求。

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language
models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal
reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar.
However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew
calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of
time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian
calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic
evaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system:
the Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks
that require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range
of English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can
perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with
Japanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars.
Our results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped
for culture-specific calendar understanding.

Motivation: 现有方法在可扩展性、通信依赖性和动态故障鲁棒性方面存在不足，而无人机群协同运输在物流和灾难响应中具有变革潜力。

Method: 开发去中心化耗散力模型，每个机器人根据邻居机器人和悬挂负载动态调整位置，类似于能量耗散的桌腿反应机制。

Result: 仿真显示跟踪误差比现有方法降低20%-68.5%，真实实验中6架无人机在单机故障、断开事件、25%负载变化和40%缆长不确定性下达到94%成功率，在4级风力下保持强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法将群体智能与机械稳定性原理结合，为异构空中系统在通信受限环境中处理复杂运输任务提供了可扩展框架。

Abstract: In comparison with existing approaches, which struggle with scalability,
communication dependency, and robustness against dynamic failures, cooperative
aerial transportation via robot swarms holds transformative potential for
logistics and disaster response. Here, we present a physics-inspired
cooperative transportation approach for flying robot swarms that imitates the
dissipative mechanics of table-leg load distribution. By developing a
decentralized dissipative force model, our approach enables autonomous
formation stabilization and adaptive load allocation without the requirement of
explicit communication. Based on local neighbor robots and the suspended
payload, each robot dynamically adjusts its position. This is similar to
energy-dissipating table leg reactions. The stability of the resultant control
system is rigorously proved. Simulations demonstrate that the tracking errors
of the proposed approach are 20%, 68%, 55.5%, and 21.9% of existing approaches
under the cases of capability variation, cable uncertainty, limited vision, and
payload variation, respectively. In real-world experiments with six flying
robots, the cooperative aerial transportation system achieved a 94% success
rate under single-robot failure, disconnection events, 25% payload variation,
and 40% cable length uncertainty, demonstrating strong robustness under outdoor
winds up to Beaufort scale 4. Overall, this physics-inspired approach bridges
swarm intelligence and mechanical stability principles, offering a scalable
framework for heterogeneous aerial systems to collectively handle complex
transportation tasks in communication-constrained environments.

Motivation: 解决在约束环境中两个机器人协作运输物体时的抓取决策问题，需要一种能够适应不同环境和物体形状的通用方案

Method: 使用两个神经网络构成条件嵌入模型，将抓取配置信息映射到嵌入空间，通过监督学习和负样本采样训练，确保嵌入向量能够区分可行和不可行的抓取配置

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种有效的方法来解决双机器人协作抓取运输问题，具有良好的通用性和实际应用价值

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for decision-making in cooperative grasping for
two-robot object transport in constrained environments. The core of the
framework is a Conditional Embedding (CE) model consisting of two neural
networks that map grasp configuration information into an embedding space. The
resulting embedding vectors are then used to identify feasible grasp
configurations that allow two robots to collaboratively transport an object. To
ensure generalizability across diverse environments and object geometries, the
neural networks are trained on a dataset comprising a range of environment maps
and object shapes. We employ a supervised learning approach with negative
sampling to ensure that the learned embeddings effectively distinguish between
feasible and infeasible grasp configurations. Evaluation results across a wide
range of environments and objects in simulations demonstrate the model's
ability to reliably identify feasible grasp configurations. We further validate
the framework through experiments on a physical robotic platform, confirming
its practical applicability.

Abstract: The ability to generate a diverse and plausible distribution of future
trajectories is a critical capability for autonomous vehicle planning systems.
While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity,
computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge.
In this paper, we present the \textbf{Efficient Virtuoso}, a conditional latent
diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach
introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales
trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the
resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising
process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a
simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a
powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset,
reaching a \textbf{minADE of 0.25}. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation
study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint
goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is
essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that
mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.

Abstract: Accurate real-time buoyancy modeling is essential for high-fidelity
Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) simulations, yet NVIDIA Isaac Sim lacks a
native buoyancy system, requiring external solutions for precise underwater
physics. This paper presents a novel convex hull-based approach to dynamically
compute the submerged volume of an AUV in real time. By extracting mesh
geometry from the simulation environment and calculating the hull portion
intersecting the water level along the z-axis, our method enhances accuracy
over traditional geometric approximations. A cross-sectional area extension
reduces computational overhead, enabling efficient buoyant force updates that
adapt to orientation, depth, and sinusoidal wave fluctuations (+-0.3 m). Tested
on a custom AUV design for SAUVC 2025, this approach delivers real-time
performance and scalability, improving simulation fidelity for underwater
robotics research without precomputed hydrodynamic models.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has
accelerated progress in embodied artificial intelligence, yet current
approaches remain constrained by existing robotic architectures, particularly
serial mechanisms. This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of
robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic
Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic
mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic
synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive
tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and
complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel
parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering
kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We
validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID
assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired
mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine
learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to
create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic
intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for
mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware,
potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Quadruped-based mobile manipulation presents significant challenges in
robotics due to the diversity of required skills, the extended task horizon,

Result: 系统能够处理高度遮挡的桌面和空中配置，在抖动和挂放任务中展示任务无关的抓取选择能力

Conclusion: 该框架通过密集描述符提供可重用的中间表示，为更通用和可扩展的衣物操作开启了新方向

Abstract: Manipulating clothing is challenging due to complex configurations, variable
material dynamics, and frequent self-occlusion. Prior systems often flatten
garments or assume visibility of key features. We present a dual-arm
visuotactile framework that combines confidence-aware dense visual
correspondence and tactile-supervised grasp affordance to operate directly on
crumpled and suspended garments. The correspondence model is trained on a
custom, high-fidelity simulated dataset using a distributional loss that
captures cloth symmetries and generates correspondence confidence estimates.
These estimates guide a reactive state machine that adapts folding strategies
based on perceptual uncertainty. In parallel, a visuotactile grasp affordance
network, self-supervised using high-resolution tactile feedback, determines
which regions are physically graspable. The same tactile classifier is used
during execution for real-time grasp validation. By deferring action in
low-confidence states, the system handles highly occluded table-top and in-air
configurations. We demonstrate our task-agnostic grasp selection module in
folding and hanging tasks. Moreover, our dense descriptors provide a reusable
intermediate representation for other planning modalities, such as extracting
grasp targets from human video demonstrations, paving the way for more
generalizable and scalable garment manipulation.

Conclusion: 提出的多模态融合位姿估计方法有效解决了爬墙机器人在复杂建筑环境中的定位问题，克服了传统传感器的局限性

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a pose estimator for a four wheel
independent steer four wheel independent drive (4WIS4WID) wall climbing mobile
robot, based on the fusion of multimodal measurements, including wheel
odometry, visual odometry, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) data using
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The pose
estimator is a critical component of wall climbing mobile robots, as their
operational environment involves carrying precise measurement equipment and
maintenance tools in construction, requiring information about pose on the
building at the time of measurement. Due to the complex geometry and material
properties of building facades, the use of traditional localization sensors
such as laser, ultrasonic, or radar is often infeasible for wall-climbing
robots. Moreover, GPS-based localization is generally unreliable in these
environments because of signal degradation caused by reinforced concrete and
electromagnetic interference. Consequently, robot odometry remains the primary
source of velocity and position information, despite being susceptible to drift
caused by both systematic and non-systematic errors. The calibrations of the
robot's systematic parameters were conducted using nonlinear optimization and
Levenberg-Marquardt methods as Newton-Gauss and gradient-based model fitting
methods, while Genetic algorithm and Particle swarm were used as
stochastic-based methods for kinematic parameter calibration. Performance and
results of the calibration methods and pose estimators were validated in detail
with experiments on the experimental mobile wall climbing robot.

Conclusion: FPC-VLA通过集成故障预测和校正机制，展示了强大的泛化能力和实际应用价值，为构建更可靠的自主系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation is a fundamental component of automation. However,
traditional perception-planning pipelines often fall short in open-ended tasks
due to limited flexibility, while the architecture of a single end-to-end
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) offers promising capabilities but lacks crucial
mechanisms for anticipating and recovering from failure. To address these
challenges, we propose FPC-VLA, a dual-model framework that integrates VLA with
a supervisor for failure prediction and correction. The supervisor evaluates
action viability through vision-language queries and generates corrective
strategies when risks arise, trained efficiently without manual labeling. A
similarity-guided fusion module further refines actions by leveraging past
predictions. Evaluation results on multiple simulation platforms (SIMPLER and
LIBERO) and robot embodiments (WidowX, Google Robot, Franka) show that FPC-VLA
outperforms state-of-the-art models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
By activating the supervisor only at keyframes, our approach significantly
increases task success rates with minimal impact on execution time. Successful
real-world deployments on diverse, long-horizon tasks confirm FPC-VLA's strong
generalization and practical utility for building more reliable autonomous
systems.

communication concept. The implemented prototype sensor showcases minimal data

our developed communication system. This work contributes to advancing
real-time data acquisition, providing insights into optimizing integrated wheel

Result: ARFM在仿真和真实世界实验中表现出优异的泛化性、鲁棒性、少样本学习和持续学习性能

Conclusion: ARFM为VLA流模型提供了稳定高效的离线RL微调方法，显著提升了复杂下游任务的动作精度

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models based on flow matching have shown
excellent performance in general-purpose robotic manipulation tasks. However,
the action accuracy of these models on complex downstream tasks is
unsatisfactory. One important reason is that these models rely solely on the
post-training paradigm of imitation learning, which makes it difficult to have
a deeper understanding of the distribution properties of data quality, which is
exactly what Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at. In this paper, we
theoretically propose an offline RL post-training objective for VLA flow models
and induce an efficient and feasible offline RL fine-tuning algorithm --
Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM). By introducing an adaptively adjusted
scaling factor in the VLA flow model loss, we construct a principled
bias-variance trade-off objective function to optimally control the impact of
RL signal on flow loss. ARFM adaptively balances RL advantage preservation and
flow loss gradient variance control, resulting in a more stable and efficient
fine-tuning process. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results
show that ARFM exhibits excellent generalization, robustness, few-shot
learning, and continuous learning performance.

Abstract: This paper proposes an exploration-efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning with
Reference policy (DRLR) framework for learning robotics tasks that incorporates
demonstrations. The DRLR framework is developed based on an algorithm called
Imitation Bootstrapped Reinforcement Learning (IBRL). We propose to improve
IBRL by modifying the action selection module. The proposed action selection
module provides a calibrated Q-value, which mitigates the bootstrapping error
that otherwise leads to inefficient exploration. Furthermore, to prevent the RL
policy from converging to a sub-optimal policy, SAC is used as the RL policy
instead of TD3. The effectiveness of our method in mitigating bootstrapping
error and preventing overfitting is empirically validated by learning two
robotics tasks: bucket loading and open drawer, which require extensive
interactions with the environment. Simulation results also demonstrate the
robustness of the DRLR framework across tasks with both low and high
state-action dimensions, and varying demonstration qualities. To evaluate the
developed framework on a real-world industrial robotics task, the bucket
loading task is deployed on a real wheel loader. The sim2real results validate
the successful deployment of the DRLR framework.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based action model for robotic motion planning.
Commonly, established numerical planning approaches are used to solve general
motion planning problems, but have significant runtime requirements. By
leveraging the power of deep learning, we are able to achieve good results in a
much smaller runtime by learning from a dataset generated by these planners.
While our initial model uses point cloud embeddings in the input to predict
keypoint-based joint sequences in its output, we observed in our ablation study
that it remained challenging to condition the network on the point cloud
embeddings. We identified some biases in our dataset and refined it, which
improved the model's performance. Our model, even without the use of the point
cloud encodings, outperforms numerical models by an order of magnitude
regarding the runtime, while reaching a success rate of up to 90% of collision
free solutions on the test set.

Abstract: Object reconstruction and inspection tasks play a crucial role in various
robotics applications. Identifying paths that reveal the most unknown areas of
the object becomes paramount in this context, as it directly affects
efficiency, and this problem is known as the view path planning problem.
Current methods often use sampling-based path planning techniques, evaluating
potential views along the path to enhance reconstruction performance. However,
these methods are computationally expensive as they require evaluating several
candidate views on the path. To this end, we propose a computationally
efficient solution that relies on calculating a focus point in the most
informative (unknown) region and having the robot maintain this point in the
camera field of view along the path. We incorporated this strategy into the
whole-body control of a mobile manipulator employing a visibility constraint
without the need for an additional path planner. We conducted comprehensive and
realistic simulations using a large dataset of 114 diverse objects of varying
sizes from 57 categories to compare our method with a sampling-based planning
strategy using Bayesian data analysis. Furthermore, we performed real-world
experiments with an 8-DoF mobile manipulator to demonstrate the proposed
method's performance in practice. Our results suggest that there is no
significant difference in object coverage and entropy. In contrast, our method
is approximately nine times faster than the baseline sampling-based method in
terms of the average time the robot spends between views.

Abstract: Cloud robotics has emerged as a promising technology for robotics
applications due to its advantages of offloading computationally intensive
tasks, facilitating data sharing, and enhancing robot coordination. However,
integrating cloud computing with robotics remains a complex challenge due to
network latency, security concerns, and the need for efficient resource
management. In this work, we present a scalable and intuitive framework for
testing cloud and edge robotic systems. The framework consists of two main
components enabled by containerized technology: (a) a containerized cloud
cluster and (b) the containerized robot simulation environment. The system
incorporates two endpoints of a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) tunnel, enabling
bidirectional communication between the cloud cluster container and the robot
simulation environment, while simulating realistic network conditions. To
achieve this, we consider the use case of cloud-assisted remote control for
aerial robots, while utilizing Linux-based traffic control to introduce
artificial delay and jitter, replicating variable network conditions
encountered in practical cloud-robot deployments.

Result: 数值模拟验证了模型的准确性，开发了半解析迭代方案用于逆运动学，并通过数值优化处理实际机器人的离散化问题。

Conclusion: LASEM框架为连续体机器人提供了一种计算高效、无需显式接触建模的统一建模方法，适用于实时控制应用。

Abstract: Continuum robots, inspired by octopus arms and elephant trunks, combine
dexterity with intrinsic compliance, making them well suited for unstructured
and confined environments. Yet their continuously deformable morphology poses
challenges for motion planning and control, calling for accurate but
lightweight models. We propose the Lightweight Actuation Space Energy Modeling
(LASEM) framework for cable driven continuum robots, which formulates actuation
potential energy directly in actuation space. LASEM yields an analytical
forward model derived from geometrically nonlinear beam and rod theories via
Hamilton's principle, while avoiding explicit modeling of cable backbone
contact. It accepts both force and displacement inputs, thereby unifying
kinematic and static formulations. Assuming the friction is neglected, the
framework generalizes to nonuniform geometries, arbitrary cable routings,
distributed loading and axial extensibility, while remaining computationally
efficient for real-time use. Numerical simulations validate its accuracy, and a
semi-analytical iterative scheme is developed for inverse kinematics. To
address discretization in practical robots, LASEM further reformulates the
functional minimization as a numerical optimization, which also naturally
incorporates cable potential energy without explicit contact modeling.

Abstract: Grasping assistance is essential for restoring autonomy in individuals with
motor impairments, particularly in unstructured environments where object
categories and user intentions are diverse and unpredictable. We present
OVGrasp, a hierarchical control framework for soft exoskeleton-based grasp
assistance that integrates RGB-D vision, open-vocabulary prompts, and voice
commands to enable robust multimodal interaction. To enhance generalization in
open environments, OVGrasp incorporates a vision-language foundation model with
an open-vocabulary mechanism, allowing zero-shot detection of previously unseen
objects without retraining. A multimodal decision-maker further fuses spatial
and linguistic cues to infer user intent, such as grasp or release, in
multi-object scenarios. We deploy the complete framework on a custom
egocentric-view wearable exoskeleton and conduct systematic evaluations on 15
objects across three grasp types. Experimental results with ten participants
demonstrate that OVGrasp achieves a grasping ability score (GAS) of 87.00%,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and achieving improved kinematic
alignment with natural hand motion.

Abstract: We introduce perioperation, a paradigm for robotic data collection that
sensorizes and records human manipulation while maximizing the transferability
of the data to real robots. We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand
exoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision
+ tactile) data for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks in natural
environments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers,
providing users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors
the human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of
demonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make
task demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation,
increasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of
dexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect
high-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data
significantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection
compared to teleoperation, making DEXOP a powerful tool for advancing robot

TL;DR: LuxDiT是一种基于视频扩散变换器的数据驱动方法，通过微调生成HDR环境光照图，解决了单图像/视频光照估计中地面真值数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的光照估计方法受限于真实HDR环境图的稀缺性，这些数据采集成本高且多样性有限。生成模型虽在图像合成方面表现优异，但光照估计仍面临间接视觉线索依赖、全局上下文推断和高动态范围输出恢复等挑战。

Method: 提出LuxDiT方法，微调视频扩散变换器以生成基于视觉输入条件的HDR环境图。使用大规模合成数据集训练，学习从间接视觉线索推断光照。引入低秩适应微调策略，使用收集的HDR全景图数据集提高输入与预测环境图之间的语义对齐。

Conclusion: LuxDiT通过结合合成数据训练和低秩适应微调，有效解决了光照估计中的数据稀缺问题，实现了对真实场景的良好泛化能力。

Abstract: Estimating scene lighting from a single image or video remains a longstanding
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Learning-based approaches are
constrained by the scarcity of ground-truth HDR environment maps, which are
expensive to capture and limited in diversity. While recent generative models
offer strong priors for image synthesis, lighting estimation remains difficult
due to its reliance on indirect visual cues, the need to infer global
(non-local) context, and the recovery of high-dynamic-range outputs. We propose
LuxDiT, a novel data-driven approach that fine-tunes a video diffusion
transformer to generate HDR environment maps conditioned on visual input.
Trained on a large synthetic dataset with diverse lighting conditions, our
model learns to infer illumination from indirect visual cues and generalizes
effectively to real-world scenes. To improve semantic alignment between the
input and the predicted environment map, we introduce a low-rank adaptation
finetuning strategy using a collected dataset of HDR panoramas. Our method
produces accurate lighting predictions with realistic angular high-frequency
details, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS使用大量高斯点会导致GPU内存需求高、训练渲染延迟大，需要寻找在保持高斯数量的同时减少内存消耗的方法。

Method: 利用码本紧凑存储高斯参数向量，将参数估计建模为贝叶斯推断问题，使用MCMC采样在压缩表示的后验分布上进行采样。

Conclusion: ContraGS成功解决了直接训练码本压缩表示的挑战，在显著减少内存和加速性能的同时保持了高质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a state-of-art technique to model real-world
scenes with high quality and real-time rendering. Typically, a higher quality
representation can be achieved by using a large number of 3D Gaussians.
However, using large 3D Gaussian counts significantly increases the GPU device
memory for storing model parameters. A large model thus requires powerful GPUs
with high memory capacities for training and has slower training/rendering
latencies due to the inefficiencies of memory access and data movement. In this
work, we introduce ContraGS, a method to enable training directly on compressed
3DGS representations without reducing the Gaussian Counts, and thus with a
little loss in model quality. ContraGS leverages codebooks to compactly store a
set of Gaussian parameter vectors throughout the training process, thereby
significantly reducing memory consumption. While codebooks have been
demonstrated to be highly effective at compressing fully trained 3DGS models,
directly training using codebook representations is an unsolved challenge.
ContraGS solves the problem of learning non-differentiable parameters in
codebook-compressed representations by posing parameter estimation as a
Bayesian inference problem. To this end, ContraGS provides a framework that
effectively uses MCMC sampling to sample over a posterior distribution of these
compressed representations. With ContraGS, we demonstrate that ContraGS
significantly reduces the peak memory during training (on average 3.49X) and
accelerated training and rendering (1.36X and 1.88X on average, respectively),
while retraining close to state-of-art quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 估计异质性媒质的散射参数是个极其具有挑战性的问题，现有方法多假设均质媒质，而真实世界中缺乏明确的异质性散射参数分布模型。研究者发现Perlin噪声能够有效表示自然界的复杂异质性，因此尝试利用这种分布来模拟并估计真实世界的异质性散射。

Method: 首先创建HeteroSynth合成数据集，使用Fractal Perlin噪声模拟异质性散射参数。然后提出TensoIS框架，这是一种基于学习的前向方法，通过可学习的低秩张量分量来表示3D散射参数体积，而非直接预测整个体积数据。

Abstract: Estimating scattering parameters of heterogeneous media from images is a
severely under-constrained and challenging problem. Most of the existing
approaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,
approximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering
techniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have
applied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,
but they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is
known to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters
in the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal
Perlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of
natural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create
HeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of
heterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal
Perlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a
learning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed
heterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations.
Instead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses
learnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We
evaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the
HeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source
realistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its
effectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to
explore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined
distribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous
scattering in a feed-forward manner.

Abstract: Stylized motion generation is actively studied in computer graphics,
especially benefiting from the rapid advances in diffusion models. The goal of
this task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and
the desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing
research attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or
conditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a
latent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite
the progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control,
limited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than
``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this
paper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new
perspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i)
human motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a
body-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and
reason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently
compositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation
via effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an
intermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a
reasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion.
Our method executes in the body-part text space with much higher
interpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving
potential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to
new styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive
experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized
motion generation.

Abstract: Creating human avatars is a highly desirable yet challenging task. Recent
advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented
photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars.
However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering
models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their
ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand,
generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion
models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through
simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these
methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific
rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth
wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths
of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable
dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic
pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we
optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a
dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In
the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network
weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time,
controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale,
cross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods.

Abstract: An elastic rod is a long and thin body able to sustain large global
deformations, even if local strains are small. The Cosserat rod is a non-linear
elastic rod with an oriented centreline, which enables modelling of bending,
stretching and twisting deformations. It can be used for physically-based
computer simulation of threads, wires, ropes, as well as flexible surgical
instruments such as catheters, guidewires or sutures. We present a
massively-parallel implementation of the original CoRdE model as well as our
inextensible variation. By superseding the CUDA Scalable Programming Model and
using inter-block synchronization, we managed to simulate multiple physics
time-steps per single kernel launch utilizing all the GPU's streaming
multiprocessors. Under some constraints, this results in nearly constant
computation time, regardless of the number of Cosserat elements simulated. When
executing 10 time-steps per single kernel launch, our implementation of the
original, extensible CoRdE was x40.0 faster. In a number of tests, the GPU
implementation of our inextensible CoRdE modification achieved an average
speed-up of x15.11 over the corresponding CPU version. Simulating a
catheter/guidewire pair (2x512 Cosserat elements) in a cardiovascular
application resulted in a 13.5 fold performance boost, enabling for accurate
real-time simulation at haptic interactive rates (0.5-1kHz).

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents possess significant commercial and
social value, and GUI agents powered by advanced multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential. Currently, existing GUI
agents usually utilize sequential episodes of multi-step operations across
pages as the prior GUI knowledge, which fails to capture the complex transition
relationship between pages, making it challenging for the agents to deeply
perceive the GUI environment and generalize to new scenarios. Therefore, we
design an automated pipeline to transform the sequential episodes into page
graphs, which explicitly model the graph structure of the pages that are
naturally connected by actions. To fully utilize the page graphs, we further
introduce Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to effectively
retrieve reliable perception guidelines of GUI from them, and a tailored
multi-agent framework PG-Agent with task decomposition strategy is proposed to
be injected with the guidelines so that it can generalize to unseen scenarios.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
PG-Agent, even with limited episodes for page graph construction.

Conclusion: 列生成技术为准马尔可夫因果模型中的部分可识别查询提供了有效的概率边界计算方法，展示了外生变量多项式表示的可能性，并在实验中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We investigate partially identifiable queries in a class of causal models. We
focus on acyclic Structural Causal Models that are quasi-Markovian (that is,
each endogenous variable is connected with at most one exogenous confounder).
We look into scenarios where endogenous variables are observed (and a
distribution over them is known), while exogenous variables are not fully
specified. This leads to a representation that is in essence a Bayesian network
where the distribution of root variables is not uniquely determined. In such
circumstances, it may not be possible to precisely compute a probability value
of interest. We thus study the computation of tight probability bounds, a
problem that has been solved by multilinear programming in general, and by
linear programming when a single confounded component is intervened upon. We
present a new algorithm to simplify the construction of such programs by
exploiting input probabilities over endogenous variables. For scenarios with a
single intervention, we apply column generation to compute a probability bound
through a sequence of auxiliary linear integer programs, thus showing that a
representation with polynomial cardinality for exogenous variables is possible.
Experiments show column generation techniques to be superior to existing
methods.

Abstract: In the context of continuously rising global air traffic, efficient and safe
Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) is paramount for air traffic
management. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising
pathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a
"unimodal bias" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of
decision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic
constraints, often resulting in "decision deadlocks." To overcome this
limitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic
models into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous
conflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional
methods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its
policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it
to generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core
architecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC),
a training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent
progresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive
simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the
most challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high
success rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions
(NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline,
significantly enhancing the system's safety margin. This performance leap stems
from its unique multimodal decision-making capability, which allows the agent
to flexibly switch to effective alternative maneuvers.

TL;DR: 训练LLM代理进行动态规划，使其能够灵活决定何时进行规划，在长时程任务中比始终规划或从不规划更高效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如ReAct要求LLM在每个动作前都进行规划，这计算成本高且在长时程任务中性能下降，而从不规划又限制了性能

Method: 提出两阶段训练流程：1）在多样化合成数据上进行监督微调，为动态规划做准备；2）在长时程环境中使用强化学习精炼这种能力

Result: 在Crafter环境中的实验显示，动态规划代理更样本高效，能持续实现更复杂的目标，且可通过人类编写的规划有效引导

Conclusion: 这是首个探索训练LLM代理在序列决策任务中进行动态测试时计算分配的工作，为更高效、自适应和可控的代理系统铺平了道路

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to reason via reinforcement learning
(RL) significantly improves their problem-solving capabilities. In agentic
settings, existing methods like ReAct prompt LLMs to explicitly plan before
every action; however, we demonstrate that always planning is computationally
expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning
further limits performance. To address this, we introduce a conceptual
framework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to
flexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a
simple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse
synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this
capability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment
show that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more
sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives.
Additionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by
human-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities. To our
knowledge, this work is the first to explore training LLM agents for dynamic
test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making tasks, paving the
way for more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.

Motivation: 生成式AI（如大语言模型）存在幻觉和不可验证声明的问题，检索增强生成（RAG）虽然通过外部知识提高准确性，但仍是不透明的黑盒，严重依赖数据质量。

Method: 开发了方法无关的基于扰动的框架KG-SMILE，通过应用受控扰动、计算相似性并训练加权线性替代模型，识别对生成输出最具影响力的图实体和关系。

Result: KG-SMILE产生稳定、与人类对齐的解释，在保真度、忠实度、一致性、稳定性和准确性等综合归因指标上表现良好。

Conclusion: KG-SMILE能够在模型有效性和可解释性之间取得平衡，从而促进机器学习技术的更大透明度和信任。

Abstract: Generative AI, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), has achieved impressive
progress but still produces hallucinations and unverifiable claims, limiting
reliability in sensitive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves
accuracy by grounding outputs in external knowledge, especially in domains like
healthcare, where precision is vital. However, RAG remains opaque and
essentially a black box, heavily dependent on data quality. We developed a
method-agnostic, perturbation-based framework that provides token and
component-level interoperability for Graph RAG using SMILE and named it as
Knowledge-Graph (KG)-SMILE. By applying controlled perturbations, computing
similarities, and training weighted linear surrogates, KG-SMILE identifies the
graph entities and relations most influential to generated outputs, thereby
making RAG more transparent. We evaluate KG-SMILE using comprehensive
attribution metrics, including fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability,
and accuracy. Our findings show that KG-SMILE produces stable, human-aligned
explanations, demonstrating its capacity to balance model effectiveness with
interpretability and thereby fostering greater transparency and trust in
machine learning technologies.

Conclusion: CausalARC为AI推理提供了因果基础的评估框架，能够系统测试模型在低数据和分布外环境下的推理能力。

Abstract: Reasoning requires adaptation to novel problem settings under limited data
and distribution shift. This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed
for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the
Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is
sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a
structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational,
interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form
of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we
illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings:
(1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning
with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with
logical reasoning.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large
Language Models (LLMs) remain error-prone when performing logical reasoning,
often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like
comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that
grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based
on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that
structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations
of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer
Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we
demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied
cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical
reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation
focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for
incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

Result: HICRA显著超越强基线方法，验证语义熵比token级熵更能有效衡量战略探索

Conclusion: RL成功的关键在于高层战略规划，聚焦战略瓶颈是解锁高级推理能力的关键

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the
complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying
mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals
that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy
dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning
hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from
low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling
two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness
and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively
shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of
high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in
prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure
agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,
we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that
concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA
significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this
strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we
validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic
exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

Motivation: 解决SHAP在长时间序列上计算复杂度高的问题，探索最优的时间序列分段策略来提高解释性AI的实用性

Method: 研究了八种不同的时间序列分段算法，使用InterpretTime和AUC Difference两种评估方法，在单复变量时间序列上进行实验，并提出了基于段长度的归因标准化技术

Result: 发现分段数量比分段方法对解释质量影响更大，等长度分段在大多数情况下表现最佳，新的标准化技术能持续提高归因质量

Conclusion: 等长度分段是时间序列SHAP解释的最佳策略，分段数量的选择至关重要，新的归因标准化技术为提高解释质量提供了有效方法

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become an increasingly important topic for
understanding and attributing the predictions made by complex Time Series
Classification (TSC) models. Among attribution methods, SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) is widely regarded as an excellent attribution method; but
its computational complexity, which scales exponentially with the number of
features, limits its practicality for long time series. To address this, recent
studies have shown that aggregating features via segmentation, to compute a
single attribution value for a group of consecutive time points, drastically
reduces SHAP running time. However, the choice of the optimal segmentation
strategy remains an open question. In this work, we investigated eight
different Time Series Segmentation algorithms to understand how segment
compositions affect the explanation quality. We evaluate these approaches using
two established XAI evaluation methodologies: InterpretTime and AUC Difference.
Through experiments on both Multivariate (MTS) and Univariate Time Series
(UTS), we find that the number of segments has a greater impact on explanation
quality than the specific segmentation method. Notably, equal-length
segmentation consistently outperforms most of the custom time series
segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce a novel attribution
normalisation technique that weights segments by their length and we show that
it consistently improves attribution quality.

Conclusion: 这个方法为自动化红队带来了人设视角，显示了自动化与人工红队方法的补充潜力，为未来AI风险识别提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent developments in AI governance and safety research have called for
red-teaming methods that can effectively surface potential risks posed by AI
models. Many of these calls have emphasized how the identities and backgrounds
of red-teamers can shape their red-teaming strategies, and thus the kinds of
risks they are likely to uncover. While automated red-teaming approaches
promise to complement human red-teaming by enabling larger-scale exploration of
model behavior, current approaches do not consider the role of identity. As an
initial step towards incorporating people's background and identities in
automated red-teaming, we develop and evaluate a novel method, PersonaTeaming,
that introduces personas in the adversarial prompt generation process to
explore a wider spectrum of adversarial strategies. In particular, we first
introduce a methodology for mutating prompts based on either "red-teaming
expert" personas or "regular AI user" personas. We then develop a dynamic
persona-generating algorithm that automatically generates various persona types
adaptive to different seed prompts. In addition, we develop a set of new
metrics to explicitly measure the "mutation distance" to complement existing
diversity measurements of adversarial prompts. Our experiments show promising
improvements (up to 144.1%) in the attack success rates of adversarial prompts
through persona mutation, while maintaining prompt diversity, compared to
RainbowPlus, a state-of-the-art automated red-teaming method. We discuss the
strengths and limitations of different persona types and mutation methods,
shedding light on future opportunities to explore complementarities between
automated and human red-teaming approaches.

Motivation: 理解LLMs是否表现出类似人类的人格特质模式，此前研究主要依赖简化的自我报告和启发式提示，缺乏行为验证

Method: 从三个维度系统分析LLM人格：(1)训练阶段特质轮廓的动态演变；(2)自我报告特质在行为任务中的预测效度；(3)人格注入等干预措施对自我报告和行为的影响

Result: 指令对齐（如RLHF、指令微调）显著稳定特质表达并增强特质相关性，但自我报告特质无法可靠预测行为，人格注入能引导自我报告但对实际行为影响有限或不一致

Conclusion: 研究挑战了关于LLM人格的假设，强调需要区分表面特质表达和行为一致性，在对齐和可解释性方面需要更深入的评估

Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human
behavior.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar
patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying
consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and
self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work
primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with
little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM
personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of
trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of
self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted
interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.
Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction
tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait
correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported
traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often
diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers
self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect
on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from
behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM
personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and
interpretability.

Result: 发现不同模型家族和规模的LLM都存在显著的内部不一致性，尽管能生成匹配人类回答，但无法保持内部一致性。

Conclusion: LLM代理缺乏内部一致性，存在关键能力差距，无法准确替代人类研究参与者。

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the
notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in
human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim,
social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey
data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to
represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents
maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under
different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to
(a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic
dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral
hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent
with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on
these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model
families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although
agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they
fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their
capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject
research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.

Conclusion: RAGuard和SafetyClamp有潜力为关键维护环境中LLM驱动的决策支持建立安全保证的新标准。

Abstract: Accuracy and safety are paramount in Offshore Wind (OSW) maintenance, yet
conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail when confronted with
highly specialised or unexpected scenarios. We introduce RAGuard, an enhanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that explicitly integrates
safety-critical documents alongside technical manuals.By issuing parallel
queries to two indices and allocating separate retrieval budgets for knowledge
and safety, RAGuard guarantees both technical depth and safety coverage. We
further develop a SafetyClamp extension that fetches a larger candidate pool,
"hard-clamping" exact slot guarantees to safety. We evaluate across sparse
(BM25), dense (Dense Passage Retrieval) and hybrid retrieval paradigms,
measuring Technical Recall@K and Safety Recall@K. Both proposed extensions of
RAG show an increase in Safety Recall@K from almost 0\% in RAG to more than
50\% in RAGuard, while maintaining Technical Recall above 60\%. These results
demonstrate that RAGuard and SafetyClamp have the potential to establish a new
standard for integrating safety assurance into LLM-powered decision support in
critical maintenance contexts.

Abstract: In supply chain management, planning is a critical concept. The movement of
physical products across different categories, from suppliers to warehouse
management, to sales, and logistics transporting them to customers, entails the
involvement of many entities. It covers various aspects such as demand
forecasting, inventory management, sales operations, and replenishment. How to
collect relevant data from an e-commerce platform's perspective, formulate
long-term plans, and dynamically adjust them based on environmental changes,
while ensuring interpretability, efficiency, and reliability, is a practical
and challenging problem. In recent years, the development of AI technologies,
especially the rapid progress of large language models, has provided new tools
to address real-world issues. In this work, we construct a Supply Chain
Planning Agent (SCPA) framework that can understand domain knowledge,
comprehend the operator's needs, decompose tasks, leverage or create new tools,
and return evidence-based planning reports. We deploy this framework in
JD.com's real-world scenario, demonstrating the feasibility of LLM-agent
applications in the supply chain. It effectively reduced labor and improved

Conclusion: 这项工作为多智能体LLM系统学习自适应、元认知策略提供了新范式，将重点从设计固定协议转向学习动态的审议策略

Abstract: Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) show promise for complex
reasoning, but their effectiveness is often limited by fixed collaboration
protocols. These frameworks typically focus on macro-level orchestration while
overlooking agents' internal deliberative capabilities. This critical
meta-cognitive blindspot treats agents as passive executors unable to adapt
their strategy based on internal cognitive states like uncertainty or
confidence. We introduce the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), where
agents learn a decentralized policy over a set of high-level meta-cognitive
actions: Persist, Refine, and Concede. To overcome the instability of
traditional policy gradients in this setting, we develop SoftRankPO, a novel
reinforcement learning algorithm. SoftRankPO stabilizes training by shaping
advantages based on the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles,
making the learning process robust to reward variance. Experiments show that
MPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a a 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across
five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six
state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms.
Our work presents a paradigm for learning adaptive, meta-cognitive policies for
multi-agent LLM systems, shifting the focus from designing fixed protocols to
learning dynamic, deliberative strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in high-stakes
domains. Their capacity to process vast amounts of unstructured data, explore
flexible scenarios, and handle a diversity of contextual factors can make them
uniquely suited to provide new insights for the complexity of social
policymaking. This article evaluates whether LLMs' are aligned with domain
experts (and among themselves) to inform social policymaking on the subject of
homelessness alleviation - a challenge affecting over 150 million people
worldwide. We develop a novel benchmark comprised of decision scenarios with
policy choices across four geographies (South Bend, USA; Barcelona, Spain;
Johannesburg, South Africa; Macau SAR, China). The policies in scope are
grounded in the conceptual framework of the Capability Approach for human
development. We also present an automated pipeline that connects the
benchmarked policies to an agent-based model, and we explore the social impact
of the recommended policies through simulated social scenarios. The paper
results reveal promising potential to leverage LLMs for social policy making.
If responsible guardrails and contextual calibrations are introduced in
collaboration with local domain experts, LLMs can provide humans with valuable
insights, in the form of alternative policies at scale.

TL;DR: 基于Model Context Protocol的无训练、防幽灵的OMOP CDM医学术语映射系统，通过外部资源调用提高映射效率和准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OMOP CDM标准化过程中的源医学术语映射工作资源浪费且易出错，而LLM存在幽灵问题不适合直接临床部署

Method: 采用Model Context Protocol(MCP)标准化框架，允许LLM安全调用外部资源和工具，实现可解释的映射过程

Result: 系统显著提高了映射效率和准确性，支持实时词汇查询和结构化推理输出，适用于探索性和生产环境

Conclusion: 该方法为OMOP CDM数据标准化提供了一种高效、可靠的术语映射解决方案，避免了传统LLM的幽灵问题

Abstract: The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM)
provides a standardized representation of heterogeneous health data to support
large-scale, multi-institutional research. One critical step in data
standardization using OMOP CDM is the mapping of source medical terms to OMOP
standard concepts, a procedure that is resource-intensive and error-prone.
While large language models (LLMs) have the potential to facilitate this
process, their tendency toward hallucination makes them unsuitable for clinical
deployment without training and expert validation. Here, we developed a
zero-training, hallucination-preventive mapping system based on the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized and secure framework allowing LLMs to
interact with external resources and tools. The system enables explainable
mapping and significantly improves efficiency and accuracy with minimal effort.
It provides real-time vocabulary lookups and structured reasoning outputs
suitable for immediate use in both exploratory and production environments.

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种整合的、数据驱动的方法来解码游客感知，为旅游业、遗产保护和公共空间设计的管理决策提供了重要供能

Abstract: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage
while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding
how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,
human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional
AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban
quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic
quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,
color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified
from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To
assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering
method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color
themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street
views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps
between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both
stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated
through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and
a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:
tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business
formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and
emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this
framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist
perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage
conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.

TL;DR: 提出使用确定性知识图谱和LLM生成的知识图谱来实时监控和评估生成式AI的可靠性，通过结构指标检测语义异常和幻觉


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI存在幻觉、语义漂移和偏见等可靠性问题，当前评估方法主要依赖主观人工评估，缺乏可扩展性和透明度

Method: 构建两个并行知识图谱：确定性KG（基于规则方法、预定义本体和领域词典）和LLM生成KG（从实时文本数据流动态生成），使用ICR、IPR、CI等KG指标量化结构偏差，建立动态异常阈值进行实时监控

Result: 通过实时新闻流确保真实性，减少重复训练带来的偏见，防止LLM通过反馈记忆绕过预定义基准测试

Conclusion: 这种结构化的、基于指标的确定性KG与动态生成KG比较方法，提供了一个强大且可扩展的评估框架

Abstract: Generative AI (GEN AI) models have revolutionized diverse application domains
but present substantial challenges due to reliability concerns, including
hallucinations, semantic drift, and inherent biases. These models typically
operate as black-boxes, complicating transparent and objective evaluation.
Current evaluation methods primarily depend on subjective human assessment,
limiting scalability, transparency, and effectiveness. This research proposes a
systematic methodology using deterministic and Large Language Model
(LLM)-generated Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to continuously monitor and evaluate GEN
AI reliability. We construct two parallel KGs: (i) a deterministic KG built
using explicit rule-based methods, predefined ontologies, domain-specific
dictionaries, and structured entity-relation extraction rules, and (ii) an
LLM-generated KG dynamically derived from real-time textual data streams such
as live news articles. Utilizing real-time news streams ensures authenticity,
mitigates biases from repetitive training, and prevents adaptive LLMs from
bypassing predefined benchmarks through feedback memorization. To quantify
structural deviations and semantic discrepancies, we employ several established
KG metrics, including Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property
Ratio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI). An automated real-time monitoring
framework continuously computes deviations between deterministic and
LLM-generated KGs. By establishing dynamic anomaly thresholds based on
historical structural metric distributions, our method proactively identifies
and flags significant deviations, thus promptly detecting semantic anomalies or
hallucinations. This structured, metric-driven comparison between deterministic
and dynamically generated KGs delivers a robust and scalable evaluation
framework.

TL;DR: 提出Expedition and Expansion (E&E)混合策略，结合局部新颖性搜索和目标导向探索，使用视觉语言模型生成语义目标，在连续元胞自动机中发现更多样化的模式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统新颖性搜索在连续元胞自动机中容易陷入局部最优，无法探索遥远区域的行为空间，需要新的探索策略来突破局部新颖性边界

Method: E&E策略交替进行局部新颖性驱动的扩展和目标导向的远征，利用视觉语言模型生成语言目标来描述假设的有趣模式，驱动探索走向未开发区域

Result: 在Flow Lenia连续元胞自动机上测试，E&E比现有方法发现更多样化的解决方案，谱系分析显示远征起源的解决方案对长期探索有不成比例的影响

Conclusion: E&E能够突破局部新颖性边界，以人类可理解的方式探索行为景观，为人工生命等领域的开放式探索提供了有前景的模板

Abstract: Discovering diverse visual patterns in continuous cellular automata (CA) is
challenging due to the vastness and redundancy of high-dimensional behavioral
spaces. Traditional exploration methods like Novelty Search (NS) expand locally
by mutating known novel solutions but often plateau when local novelty is
exhausted, failing to reach distant, unexplored regions. We introduce
Expedition and Expansion (E&E), a hybrid strategy where exploration alternates
between local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions. During
expeditions, E&E leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate linguistic
goals--descriptions of interesting but hypothetical patterns that drive
exploration toward uncharted regions. By operating in semantic spaces that
align with human perception, E&E both evaluates novelty and generates goals in
conceptually meaningful ways, enhancing the interpretability and relevance of
discovered behaviors. Tested on Flow Lenia, a continuous CA known for its rich,
emergent behaviors, E&E consistently uncovers more diverse solutions than
existing exploration methods. A genealogical analysis further reveals that
solutions originating from expeditions disproportionately influence long-term
exploration, unlocking new behavioral niches that serve as stepping stones for
subsequent search. These findings highlight E&E's capacity to break through
local novelty boundaries and explore behavioral landscapes in human-aligned,
interpretable ways, offering a promising template for open-ended exploration in
artificial life and beyond.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), marks a
paradigm shift from reactive generative systems to proactive, goal-oriented
autonomous agents capable of sophisticated planning, memory, and tool use. This
evolution presents a novel opportunity to address long-standing challenges in
complex digital environments. Core tasks on Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)
e-commerce platforms often require users to navigate complex Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs), making the experience time-consuming for both buyers and
sellers. This paper introduces a novel approach to simplify these interactions
through an LLM-powered agentic assistant. This agent functions as a new,
conversational entry point to the marketplace, shifting the primary interaction
model from a complex GUI to an intuitive AI agent. By interpreting natural
language commands, the agent automates key high-friction workflows. For
sellers, this includes simplified updating and renewal of listings, and the
ability to send bulk messages. For buyers, the agent facilitates a more
efficient product discovery process through conversational search. We present
the architecture for Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA), arguing that this
agentic, conversational paradigm provides a lightweight and more accessible
alternative to traditional app interfaces, allowing users to manage their
marketplace activities with greater efficiency. Experiments show FaMA achieves
a 98% task success rate on solving complex tasks on the marketplace and enables
up to a 2x speedup on interaction time.

TL;DR: DeepMedix-R1是一个用于胸部X光片解读的医疗基础模型，通过三阶段训练实现透明推理和局部可解释性，在报告生成和视觉问答任务上显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗基础模型以黑盒方式生成答案，缺乏透明的推理过程和局部可解释性，这阻碍了其在实际临床部署中的应用。

Method: 采用顺序训练流程：1）在精选的CXR指令数据上微调获得基础解读能力；2）暴露于高质量合成推理样本实现冷启动推理；3）通过在线强化学习优化接地推理质量和生成性能。

Result: 在报告生成任务上分别比LLaVA-Rad和MedGemma提升14.54%和31.32%；在视觉问答任务上分别比MedGemma和CheXagent提升57.75%和23.06%。专家评审显示相比Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型具有更好的可解释性和临床合理性。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了医疗基础模型向整体性、透明性和临床可操作性的方向发展，为CXR解读提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical foundation models (FMs) have shown tremendous promise amid the rapid
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, current
medical FMs typically generate answers in a black-box manner, lacking
transparent reasoning processes and locally grounded interpretability, which
hinders their practical clinical deployments. To this end, we introduce
DeepMedix-R1, a holistic medical FM for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation. It
leverages a sequential training pipeline: initially fine-tuned on curated CXR
instruction data to equip with fundamental CXR interpretation capabilities,
then exposed to high-quality synthetic reasoning samples to enable cold-start
reasoning, and finally refined via online reinforcement learning to enhance
both grounded reasoning quality and generation performance. Thus, the model
produces both an answer and reasoning steps tied to the image's local regions
for each query. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements
in report generation (e.g., 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma) and
visual question answering (e.g., 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma and CheXagent)
tasks. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose Report Arena, a benchmarking
framework using advanced language models to evaluate answer quality, further
highlighting the superiority of DeepMedix-R1. Expert review of generated
reasoning steps reveals greater interpretability and clinical plausibility
compared to the established Qwen2.5-VL-7B model (0.7416 vs. 0.2584 overall
preference). Collectively, our work advances medical FM development toward
holistic, transparent, and clinically actionable modeling for CXR
interpretation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的启发式搜索算法，将控制参数作为真正的决策点处理，而不是作为约束条件，通过延迟部分扩展策略在无限决策空间中进行搜索


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将控制参数作为嵌入约束处理，而不是作为搜索空间中的决策点，这限制了搜索效率。需要一种能够显式处理控制参数作为真正决策点的方法

Method: 开发了最佳优先启发式搜索算法，采用延迟部分扩展策略，在控制参数定义的无限决策空间中进行系统搜索，逐步扩展状态的后继子集

Result: 该算法在涉及控制参数的规划问题求解中表现出竞争力，证明了在特定条件下的极限完备性

Conclusion: 提出的显式处理控制参数作为决策点的搜索方法是现有方法的有效替代方案，为处理连续数值决策变量提供了新的解决思路

Abstract: In automated planning, control parameters extend standard action
representations through the introduction of continuous numeric decision
variables. Existing state-of-the-art approaches have primarily handled control
parameters as embedded constraints alongside other temporal and numeric
restrictions, and thus have implicitly treated them as additional constraints
rather than as decision points in the search space. In this paper, we propose
an efficient alternative that explicitly handles control parameters as true
decision points within a systematic search scheme. We develop a best-first,
heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined
by control parameters and prove a notion of completeness in the limit under
certain conditions. Our algorithm leverages the concept of delayed partial
expansion, where a state is not fully expanded but instead incrementally
expands a subset of its successors. Our results demonstrate that this novel
search algorithm is a competitive alternative to existing approaches for
solving planning problems involving control parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具身AI中智能体在新领域自适应需要大量数据收集和重新训练的问题，提高跨领域适应性和数据效率。

Method: 采用原型化世界模型检索方法，利用基于轨迹的抽象表示匹配，开发世界级复合注意力机制来整合多个世界模型的知识并对其齐中间表示。

Result: 在VirtualHome和ALFWorld基准测试中表现出优于多个基于LLM的方法的零样本和少样本性能。

Conclusion: WorMI框架展示了在需要适应性和数据效率的具身智能体场景中可扩展、实际部署的潜力。

Abstract: In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt
to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To
address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that
combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with
independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time
composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models,
the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability.
In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval
approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation
matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also
develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the
knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate
representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's
policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from
multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We
evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating
superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based
approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the
frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent
scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Meta-Policy Reflexion (MPR)框架，通过结构化元策略记忆和双重推理机制，解决了LLM智能体在跨任务适应性和知识重用方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反思策略产生的任务特定痕迹无法跨任务重用，而基于强化学习的方法需要大量参数更新和计算资源。需要一种既能重用知识又无需模型权重更新的方法。

Method: MPR框架将LLM生成的反思整合为结构化元策略记忆(MPM)，通过软记忆引导解码和硬规则可接受性检查(HAC)两种机制在推理时应用记忆。

Result: 实验结果表明，与Reflexion基线相比，在执行准确性和鲁棒性方面取得了一致的提升，规则可接受性检查进一步提高了稳定性。

Conclusion: MPR框架能够外部化可重用的纠正知识，强制执行领域约束，同时保持基于语言的反思的适应性，为多模态和多智能体扩展提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents achieve impressive single-task performance
but commonly exhibit repeated failures, inefficient exploration, and limited
cross-task adaptability. Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion,
ReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral,
task-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning
based alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial
parameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion
(MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a
structured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at
inference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding
and hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable
corrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain
constraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the
adaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation,
present algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a
text-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in
the provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the
supplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and
robustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further
improves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss
scalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and
multi?agent extensions.

TL;DR: AutoPBO是一个基于大语言模型的框架，用于自动优化伪布尔优化(PBO)局部搜索求解器，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有局部搜索方法，并与最先进求解器保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪布尔优化(PBO)是组合问题建模的强大框架，局部搜索求解器性能优异但设计需要大量专家经验和手动调优。大语言模型在算法设计自动化方面展现潜力，但在优化PBO求解器方面的应用尚未探索。

Method: 提出AutoPBO框架，利用大语言模型自动增强PBO局部搜索求解器，通过自动化方式优化求解器的内部启发式策略，减少人工调优需求。

Result: 在四个公共基准测试（包括真实世界基准、PB竞赛基准、整数线性规划优化基准和组合基准）上，AutoPBO相比六个最先进竞争对手（包括NuPBO、OraSLS、PBO-IHS、RoundingSat、Gurobi和SCIP）表现出显著改进，特别是在局部搜索方法方面。

Conclusion: AutoPBO为自动化局部搜索求解器设计提供了有前景的方法，能够显著提升PBO求解器性能，同时保持与最先进求解器的竞争力。

Abstract: Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) provides a powerful framework for modeling
combinatorial problems through pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints. Local search
solvers have shown excellent performance in PBO solving, and their efficiency
is highly dependent on their internal heuristics to guide the search. Still,
their design often requires significant expert effort and manual tuning in
practice. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in
automating algorithm design, their application to optimizing PBO solvers
remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce AutoPBO, a novel LLM-powered
framework to automatically enhance PBO local search solvers. We conduct
experiments on a broad range of four public benchmarks, including one
real-world benchmark, a benchmark from PB competition, an integer linear
programming optimization benchmark, and a crafted combinatorial benchmark, to
evaluate the performance improvement achieved by AutoPBO and compare it with
six state-of-the-art competitors, including two local search PBO solvers NuPBO
and OraSLS, two complete PB solvers PBO-IHS and RoundingSat, and two mixed
integer programming (MIP) solvers Gurobi and SCIP. AutoPBO demonstrates
significant improvements over previous local search approaches, while
maintaining competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors.
The results suggest that AutoPBO offers a promising approach to automating
local search solver design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统token级RL框架无法与多步推理过程（如Chain-of-Thought）的推理级性质对齐，存在显著理论空白。

Method: 引入CoT-Space框架，从噪声视角和风险视角分析推理过程，证明最优CoT长度的收敛是欠拟合和过拟合之间基本权衡的自然结果。

Result: 大量实验为理论发现提供了强有力的实证验证，框架能够合理解释过度思考等经验现象。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅为经验现象提供了一致性解释，还为未来开发更有效和可泛化的推理智能体提供了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant
theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to
align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes
like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,
a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete
token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,
reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise
perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an
optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off
between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments
provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework
not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as
overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future
development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

structures corresponding to concepts in RST, a language for communicating with

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在多种任务上表现优异，但其形式推理能力仍然不足。神经符号LLM推理方法通过将自然语言转换为形式语言并使用符号求解器来提升推理能力，但该方法成功的关键因素尚不明确。

Method: 通过比较四种形式语言在三个数据集和七个LLM上的表现，系统分析了形式语言选择对神经符号推理的影响。

Result: 研究发现形式语言的选择显著影响LLM的语法和语义推理能力，且这种影响在不同LLM之间存在差异。

Conclusion: 形式语言的选择是神经符号LLM推理成功的关键因素之一，需要根据具体任务和模型特点进行优化选择。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve astonishing results on a wide range of
tasks. However, their formal reasoning ability still lags behind. A promising
approach is Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning. It works by using LLMs as translators
from natural to formal languages and symbolic solvers for deriving correct
results. Still, the contributing factors to the success of Neurosymbolic LLM
reasoning remain unclear. This paper demonstrates that one previously
overlooked factor is the choice of the formal language. We introduce the
intermediate language challenge: selecting a suitable formal language for
neurosymbolic reasoning. By comparing four formal languages across three
datasets and seven LLMs, we show that the choice of formal language affects
both syntactic and semantic reasoning capabilities. We also discuss the varying
effects across different LLMs.

Motivation: 在紧急情况下，航空公司需要快速重新规划飞行路径，但传统路径规划算法计算费时，需要一种方法来加速这个过程

Method: 结合强化学习和搜索基于路径规划器，训练RL代理根据位置和大气数据预计近优路径，然后用这些预估来约束解算器的搜索空间

Conclusion: 该方法通过将RL预估与传统规划算法相结合，在保持解决方案质量的同时显著提高了计算效率，尤其适用于紧急情况下的航线重新规划

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and
search-based path planners to speed up the optimization of flight paths for
airliners, where in case of emergency a fast route re-calculation can be
crucial. The fundamental idea is to train an RL Agent to pre-compute
near-optimal paths based on location and atmospheric data and use those at
runtime to constrain the underlying path planning solver and find a solution
within a certain distance from the initial guess. The approach effectively
reduces the size of the solver's search space, significantly speeding up route
optimization. Although global optimality is not guaranteed, empirical results
conducted with Airbus aircraft's performance models show that fuel consumption
remains nearly identical to that of an unconstrained solver, with deviations
typically within 1%. At the same time, computation speed can be improved by up
to 50% as compared to using a conventional solver alone.

TL;DR: 研究DQN和CFR算法在Leduc Hold'em扑克中是否表现出诈唬行为，发现两种算法都以不同方式诈唬，但成功率相似


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在扑克游戏中，诈唬是不可预测性的重要技能，但现有计算机扑克研究主要关注胜率等指标，忽视了诈唬行为的研究

Method: 设计实验让基于强化学习的DQN和基于博弈论的CFR算法在Leduc Hold'em中对战，记录并分析它们的行动

Result: DQN和CFR都表现出诈唬行为，但方式不同。虽然尝试诈唬的频率不同，但成功诈唬（对手弃牌）的比例大致相同

Conclusion: 诈唬是游戏本身而非算法的本质特征。未来研究应关注不同的诈唬风格和完整扑克游戏

Abstract: In the game of poker, being unpredictable, or bluffing, is an essential
skill. When humans play poker, they bluff. However, most works on
computer-poker focus on performance metrics such as win rates, while bluffing
is overlooked. In this paper we study whether two popular algorithms, DQN
(based on reinforcement learning) and CFR (based on game theory), exhibit
bluffing behavior in Leduc Hold'em, a simplified version of poker. We designed
an experiment where we let the DQN and CFR agent play against each other while
we log their actions. We find that both DQN and CFR exhibit bluffing behavior,
but they do so in different ways. Although both attempt to perform bluffs at
different rates, the percentage of successful bluffs (where the opponent folds)
is roughly the same. This suggests that bluffing is an essential aspect of the
game, not of the algorithm. Future work should look at different bluffing
styles and at the full game of poker. Code at

*William Stewart*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文认为AI即使达到通用人工智能水平，也无法超越人类成为宇宙领导者，因为人类的中枢神经系统提供了与物理现实的沉浸式整合和情感体验，这是AI无法复制的关键差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI是否能够超越人类成为宇宙的合法领导者，分析人类与AI之间的根本差异，挑战AI全面优于人类的观点。

Method: 通过哲学和生物学角度的分析，比较人类中枢神经系统与AI系统的本质区别，论证情感体验和道德理解的重要性。

Result: 发现中枢神经系统是人类独有的生物构造，使人类能够体验情感、理解行为后果并发展可持续的伦理体系，这是AI无法通过制造或模拟获得的。

Conclusion: 尽管AI可能在几乎所有能力指标上超越人类，但基于DNA的生物基础而非硅基技术才是宇宙领导权的最佳基础，人类的中枢神经系统提供了不可替代的情感理解和道德判断能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI raise the possibility that AI systems will one day be
able to do anything humans can do, only better. If artificial general
intelligence (AGI) is achieved, AI systems may be able to understand, reason,
problem solve, create, and evolve at a level and speed that humans will
increasingly be unable to match, or even understand. These possibilities raise
a natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans,
a successor "digital species", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of
the universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked
differentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central
nervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical
reality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain,
joy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of
our actions on the world around us. And that emotional understanding of the
consequences of our actions is what is required to be able to develop
sustainable ethical systems, and so be fully qualified to be the leaders of the
universe. A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a
biological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be
sufficient to make AI systems superior to humans. AI systems may become more
capable than humans on almost every measure and transform our society. However,
the best foundation for leadership of our universe will always be DNA, not
silicon.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Formalizing cooking procedures remains a challenging task due to their
inherent complexity and ambiguity. We introduce an extensible domain-specific
language for representing recipes as directed action graphs, capturing
processes, transfers, environments, concurrency, and compositional structure.
Our approach enables precise, modular modeling of complex culinary workflows.
Initial manual evaluation on a full English breakfast recipe demonstrates the
DSL's expressiveness and suitability for future automated recipe analysis and
execution. This work represents initial steps towards an action-centric
ontology for cooking, using temporal graphs to enable structured machine
understanding, precise interpretation, and scalable automation of culinary
processes - both in home kitchens and professional culinary settings.

*Vera Koponen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了马尔可夫逻辑网络(MLN)在域大小趋于无穷时的分布特性，分析了三种具体MLN示例的极限行为，并证明了量化自由MLN与提升贝叶斯网络在渐近意义上的不可比性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MLN在无限域情况下的分布特性，了解软约束权重对极限行为的影响，以及比较不同形式主义在渐近表达能力上的差异。

Method: 通过三种具体MLN示例进行分析：(1)单一元关系符号的量化自由MLN；(2)偏好较少三角形/k-clique的MLN；(3)偏好较少高度数顶点的MLN。使用概率论和极限分析方法。

Result: 发现MLN的随机结构极限行为因软约束类型而异，权重可能影响也可能不影响极限行为。证明了量化自由MLN与提升贝叶斯网络在渐近意义上不可比，且MLN在大域上的分布与均匀分布集中在完全不同的区域。

Conclusion: MLN的极限行为具有多样性，软约束的选择对渐近特性有重要影响，不同概率图模型在表达能力上存在本质差异，这为理解MLN的理论性质提供了重要见解。

Abstract: A Markov logic network (MLN) determines a probability distribution on the set
of structures, or ``possible worlds'', with an arbitrary finite domain. We
study the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to
infinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the
properties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be
studied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one
relation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete
characterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An
MLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer
k-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''
for first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer
vertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis
shows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit
behaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the
soft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It
will also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted
Bayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly
meaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with
increasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not
even approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown
that on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost
all its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible
worlds than the uniform distribution does.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvoEmo是一个进化强化学习框架，通过优化动态情感表达来提升LLM在复杂多轮谈判中的表现，显著优于传统策略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在谈判中忽视了情感的功能性作用，仅生成被动的情感响应，容易受到对手操纵和战略利用

Method: 将情感状态转换建模为马尔可夫决策过程，采用基于种群的遗传优化来演化高奖励情感策略，并提出了包含普通策略和固定情感策略的评估基准

Result: EvoEmo在广泛实验和消融研究中始终优于两个基线，实现了更高的成功率、更高效率和更多买家节省

Conclusion: 自适应情感表达对于实现更有效的多轮谈判LLM代理至关重要

Abstract: Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex},
\textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However,
existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such
negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses
that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by
adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an
evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional
expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a
Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to
evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We
further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla
strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware
negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo
consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher
efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance
of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for
multi-turn negotiation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文分析了AlphaZero框架在测试环境可能变化时的部署问题，提出了简单修改方案来显著提升性能，特别是在低规划预算场景下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaZero通常假设训练和测试环境不变，这限制了其实际应用。研究如何在环境可能变化的测试场景中部署AlphaZero智能体。

Method: 对标准AlphaZero框架进行简单修改的组合，包括适应环境变化的机制，以在低规划预算下保持性能。

Result: 实验证明所提出的修改方案能显著提升AlphaZero在变化测试环境中的性能表现。

Conclusion: 通过适当的框架修改，AlphaZero能够有效应对测试环境变化的问题，代码已开源供研究使用。

Abstract: The AlphaZero framework provides a standard way of combining Monte Carlo
planning with prior knowledge provided by a previously trained policy-value
neural network. AlphaZero usually assumes that the environment on which the
neural network was trained will not change at test time, which constrains its
applicability. In this paper, we analyze the problem of deploying AlphaZero
agents in potentially changed test environments and demonstrate how the
combination of simple modifications to the standard framework can significantly
boost performance, even in settings with a low planning budget available. The
code is publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: MBTI-in-Thoughts框架通过MBTI人格类型提示工程来增强LLM智能体的行为表现，无需微调即可实现心理人格调节


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将心理学理论（如MBTI）与LLM行为设计相结合，通过人格条件化来增强智能体的行为一致性和可解释性

Method: 使用提示工程为LLM智能体注入不同人格原型，基于MBTI的认知和情感两个基础维度进行人格调节，并整合16Personalities测试进行自动化验证

Result: 人格调节在不同任务中产生一致的行为偏差：情感表达型智能体在叙事生成中表现优异，分析型智能体在博弈论设置中采用更稳定的策略，自我反思能提高合作和推理质量

Conclusion: 该框架为无需微调的心理增强AI智能体奠定了基础，能够无缝推广到其他心理学框架（如大五人格、HEXACO、九型人格）

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality
conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method
primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering,
enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology,
cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent,
interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive
agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt
more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports
experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals
that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning
quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities
test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our
approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big
Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior
design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents
without any fine-tuning.

Motivation: 解决LLM在推理过程中发现的模式和见解在上下文窗口重置后被丢弃的问题，通过概念级别外部内存实现知识的持久化和重用。

Method: 设计了从解题追踪中提炼重用性、模块化的概念抽象，并以自然语言形式存储。在新查询中动态检索相关概念并集成到提示中，以支持测试时持续学习。

Conclusion: 概念级别外部内存是一种有效的方法，能够通过测试时持续学习实现自我改进，动态更新内存比固定内存更有效。

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and
capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these
traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new
query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and
recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an
opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving
beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or
summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward
concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution
traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts
are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time
continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies
for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,
promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On
the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over
a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference
compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,
outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we
confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an
otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting
the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to
memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code available
at https://github.com/matt-seb-ho/arc_memo.
