Abstract: As the computer vision community advances autonomous driving algorithms,
integrating vision-based insights with sensor data remains essential for
improving perception, decision making, planning, prediction, simulation, and
control. Yet we must ask: Why don't we have entirely safe self-driving cars
yet? A key part of the answer lies in addressing novel scenarios, one of the
most critical barriers to real-world deployment. Our 2COOOL workshop provides a
dedicated forum for researchers and industry experts to push the state of the
art in novelty handling, including out-of-distribution hazard detection,
vision-language models for hazard understanding, new benchmarking and
methodologies, and safe autonomous driving practices. The 2nd Workshop on the
Challenge of Out-of-Label Hazards in Autonomous Driving (2COOOL) will be held
at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 in Honolulu,
Hawaii, on October 19, 2025. We aim to inspire the development of new
algorithms and systems for hazard avoidance, drawing on ideas from anomaly
detection, open-set recognition, open-vocabulary modeling, domain adaptation,
and related fields. Building on the success of its inaugural edition at the
Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025, the workshop
will feature a mix of academic and industry participation.

*Alireza Golkarieh,Kiana Kiashemshaki,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种深度学习方法来分类全景X射线图像中的牙齿状况，发现CNN与随机森林的混合模型表现最佳，准确率达到85.4%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发自动化的牙齿状况分类系统，为牙科诊断提供可靠的技术支持，提高诊断效率和准确性

Method: 使用1,512张全景X射线图像数据集，评估三种方法：自定义CNN、CNN特征提取与传统分类器混合模型、预训练架构微调。采用5折交叉验证，评估指标包括准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数

Result: 混合CNN随机森林模型表现最佳（85.4%准确率），优于自定义CNN基线（74.3%）。预训练模型中VGG16表现最好（82.3%），其次是Xception和ResNet50。混合模型在形态相似状况的区分上表现更好

Conclusion: CNN特征提取与集成分类器结合为自动化牙科诊断支持提供了实用路径，但需要更大数据集和进一步临床验证

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

*Namu Kim,Wonbin Kweon,Minsoo Kim,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Align通过Query-Query对齐解决零样本外观迁移中的注意力泄漏问题，在保持结构一致性的同时显著提升外观保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模图像生成模型在零样本外观迁移中存在注意力泄漏问题，这是由于Query-Key对齐导致的语义映射不准确

Method: 提出Q-Align方法，包含三个核心贡献：1) Query-Query对齐实现精细空间语义映射；2) Key-Value重排增强特征对应；3) 使用重排后的键值进行注意力精化

Result: 通过大量实验验证，Q-Align在外观保真度方面优于最先进方法，同时保持竞争力的结构保持能力

Conclusion: Q-Align有效解决了注意力泄漏问题，为零样本外观迁移提供了更准确的语义对齐和更好的视觉效果

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

### [4] [ERTACache: Error Rectification and Timesteps Adjustment for Efficient Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21091)
*Xurui Peng,Hong Liu,Chenqian Yan,Rui Ma,Fangmin Chen,Xing Wang,Zhihua Wu,Songwei Liu,Mingbao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERTACache是一个针对扩散模型的缓存加速框架，通过分析缓存误差的两个主要来源（特征偏移误差和步长放大误差），采用离线残差分析和轨迹感知校正系数等方法，在保持视觉质量的同时实现2倍推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型由于迭代推理过程导致计算开销巨大，虽然特征缓存提供了加速潜力，但简单的缓存重用往往导致明显的质量下降。需要解决缓存引入的累积误差问题。

Method: 提出ERTACache框架：1）离线残差分析识别可重用步骤；2）通过轨迹感知校正系数动态调整积分间隔；3）使用闭式残差线性化模型分析缓存误差。联合校正特征偏移误差和步长放大误差。

Result: 在标准图像和视频生成基准测试中，ERTACache实现高达2倍推理加速，同时保持甚至改善视觉质量。在Wan2.1视频扩散模型上，2倍加速且VBench指标下降最小，有效保持基准保真度。

Conclusion: ERTACache提供了一个原则性的缓存框架，能够在不牺牲质量的情况下显著加速扩散模型推理，为实际部署提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at
https://github.com/bytedance/ERTACache.

### [5] [Video-LLMs with Temporal Visual Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21094)
*Zheyu Fan,Jiateng Liu,Yuji Zhang,Zihan Wang,Yi R.,Fung,Manling Li,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Temporal Visual Screening (TVS)任务，通过保留关键视频片段和重构查询来提升视频大语言模型的时序语义理解能力，在训练和推理阶段分别带来7.33%和34.6%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型由于稀疏帧采样和缺乏帧间推理监督，难以捕捉细粒度时序语义，而人类能够通过拖动进度条自然地筛选重要时间片段。

Method: 提出TVS任务，包含三个核心步骤：(1)保留焦点关键视频片段，(2)同步重构查询到最直接形式并保持答案一致性，(3)保持答案的不变性和一致性。TVS作为模块化前端适配器任务，可无缝集成到视频指令微调和视频问答流程中。

Result: 构建了首个TVS基准测试，提出的ReSimplifyIt基线在视频修剪任务上F-1分数比先前方法提升0.47，在查询重写任务上达到竞争性性能。TVS在训练阶段带来7.33%的相对增益，在推理阶段带来34.6%的相对增益。

Conclusion: TVS通过时序信息筛选有效提升了视频语言理解能力，优化了推理负担和认知负载的分布，证明了时序视觉筛选对改进视频大语言模型性能的重要性。

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

### [6] [ROBUST-MIPS: A Combined Skeletal Pose and Instance Segmentation Dataset for Laparoscopic Surgical Instruments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21096)
*Zhe Han,Charlie Budd,Gongyu Zhang,Huanyu Tian,Christos Bergeles,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用骨骼姿态标注作为手术工具定位的标注方法，比分割标注更高效，并发布了ROBUST-MIPS数据集来促进这种标注方式的采用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的手术工具定位方法受限于标注数据的多样性，分割标注虽然语义信息丰富但标注成本高。作者认为骨骼姿态标注在语义丰富性和标注效率之间取得了更好的平衡。

Method: 从现有的ROBUST-MIS数据集衍生出ROBUST-MIPS数据集，包含工具姿态和实例分割两种标注。使用流行的姿态估计方法建立简单基准测试。

Result: 观察到使用姿态标注进行手术工具定位能够获得高质量的结果，证明了这种标注方式的充分性。

Conclusion: 骨骼姿态标注是手术工具定位的高效标注方法，能够加速标注数据的增长，为此发布了数据集、基准模型和标注软件来促进采用。

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

### [7] [Safe-Control: A Safety Patch for Mitigating Unsafe Content in Text-to-Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21099)
*Xiangtao Meng,Yingkai Dong,Ning Yu,Li Wang,Zheng Li,Shanqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Safe-Control是一种即插即用的安全补丁，通过数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，在锁定T2I模型中注入安全控制信号，有效减少不安全内容生成，同时保持良性图像质量和文本对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I生成模型的安全机制存在缺陷，外部机制容易在分布偏移下被规避，内部机制需要大量模型特定调整，需要一种更有效的安全解决方案。

Method: 使用数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，以补丁形式向锁定的T2I模型注入安全控制信号，支持构建多种安全补丁并灵活合并为统一补丁。

Result: 在6个不同T2I模型上评估显示，Safe-Control将不安全内容生成概率降至7%，显著优于其他7种最先进安全机制（约20%），同时保持良性图像质量和文本对齐。

Conclusion: Safe-Control提供了一种有效、灵活且兼容性强的安全解决方案，能够显著减少T2I模型的不安全内容生成，适用于类似去噪架构的各种T2I模型。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENNAV是一个用于从自然语言指令和前置摄像头图像中识别目标区域位置的新方法，特别擅长处理stuff-type目标区域和多重目标情况，在真实世界环境中表现出优秀的零样本迁移性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理stuff-type目标区域（边界模糊）以及无目标或多目标情况时表现不佳，需要开发能够同时预测目标存在性和生成分割掩码的解决方案。

Method: 提出GENNAV方法，能够预测目标存在性并为多个stuff-type目标区域生成分割掩码。构建了GRiN-Drive基准数据集，包含无目标、单目标和多目标三种样本类型。

Result: GENNAV在标准评估指标上优于基线方法。在五个不同地理区域的真实世界汽车实验中，表现出优秀的零样本迁移性能和跨环境鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GENNAV成功解决了stuff-type目标区域识别和多重目标处理的挑战，在真实世界导航任务中展现出实用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

### [9] [R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113)
*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-4B是一个自适应思维的多模态大语言模型，能够根据问题复杂度自动决定是否启用思维过程，在保持高性能的同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时也会使用逐步思维过程，造成计算资源浪费，需要一种能够自适应决定是否启用思维的高效模型。

Method: 采用双模式退火训练，结合双模式策略优化(BPO)，首先在精心策划的数据集上训练思维和非思维两种模式，然后在改进的GRPO框架下进行第二阶段训练。

Result: 在25个具有挑战性的基准测试中达到最先进性能，在大多数任务上超越Qwen2.5-VL-7B，在推理密集型基准上与更大的16B模型性能相当但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: R-4B通过自适应思维机制成功解决了MLLMs在处理简单问题时的计算效率问题，实现了性能与效率的良好平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

*Harris Song,Tuan-Anh Vu,Sanjith Menon,Sriram Narasimhan,M. Khalid Jawed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiddenObject是一个基于Mamba的多模态融合框架，整合RGB、热成像和深度数据，在遮挡、伪装等复杂条件下实现更鲁棒的目标检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB检测方法在遮挡、伪装和光照变化等恶劣条件下性能受限，需要更鲁棒的模态无关方法来解决多模态环境中的隐藏目标检测问题。

Method: 提出Mamba-based融合机制，整合RGB、热成像和深度三种模态数据，捕捉跨模态的互补信号，识别模态特定特征并在统一表示中进行融合。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证，相比现有方法达到state-of-the-art或竞争性性能，证明了融合设计的有效性。

Conclusion: Mamba-based融合架构能显著推进多模态目标检测领域发展，特别是在视觉退化或复杂条件下，同时暴露了当前单模态和简单融合策略的关键局限性。

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统"渲染比较"方法在CT/X-ray配准中存在空间信息丢失和域差距问题，而现有的双平面X射线3D重建方法受限于密集视图要求和噪声X射线的处理困难。

Method: 提出RadGS-Reg框架，包含双平面X射线椎体辐射高斯重建模块，采用基于学习的辐射高斯重建方法和反事实注意力学习机制，专注于噪声X射线中的椎体区域，并使用患者特定的预训练策略从模拟数据逐步适应到真实数据。

Result: 在内部数据集上的实验表明，该方法在两个任务上都达到了最先进的性能，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg通过联合重建和配准的方法，有效解决了CT/X-ray配准中的关键挑战，为图像引导导航提供了高精度和实时性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

TL;DR: SYNBUILD-3D是一个包含620万个合成3D住宅建筑的大规模多模态数据集，提供LoD 4级别的语义标注，支持三种数据模态：3D线框图、平面图图像和LiDAR式屋顶点云。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模标注的3D建筑数据集，自动生成准确且语义丰富的3D建筑模型面临重大挑战。受计算机视觉中合成数据成功的启发，需要创建大规模合成数据集来支持相关研究。

Method: 创建包含超过620万个合成3D住宅建筑的数据集，每个建筑通过三种模态表示：LoD 4语义增强3D线框图、对应平面图图像和LiDAR式屋顶点云。语义标注从平面图图像中推导，包含房间、门窗信息。

Conclusion: SYNBUILD-3D的三模态特性可用于开发新型生成式AI算法，自动化创建LoD 4级别的3D建筑模型，同时保持语义-几何一致性，推动3D建筑建模领域的发展。

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at

Motivation: 在实际图像处理中，相机镜头引起的几何畸变会影响单应性估计的准确性。传统方法需要分别处理三种不同的径向畸变配置情况，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的统一方法，能够同时处理三种径向畸变配置：(i)仅一幅图像有畸变，(ii)两幅图像有相同畸变，(iii)两幅图像有独立畸变。基于该方法构建了快速、稳定、准确的最小化解算器。

Result: 在所有三种情况下，提出的解算器都比现有最先进的解算器更快，同时保持相似的准确性。在包括鱼眼相机图像在内的成熟基准测试中进行了验证。

Conclusion: 该方法为径向畸变单应性估计提供了一个统一的框架，所开发的解算器在速度和准确性方面都表现出色，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

*Zhenghao He,Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了全局概念激活向量(GCAV)框架，通过对比学习和注意力融合机制统一不同层的CAV表示，解决跨层概念不一致问题，提高概念归因的稳定性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念激活向量(CAVs)在不同层独立计算时存在不一致性，导致跨层比较不可靠，需要一种统一的概念表示方法。

Method: 使用对比学习对齐跨层概念表示，采用基于注意力的融合机制构建全局集成的CAV，并提出了TGCAV方法来评估GCAV表示。

Result: 实验表明GCAV有效减少了TCAV分数的方差，保持了概念相关性，增强了概念定位能力，并提高了对抗扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GCAV通过整合跨层信息提供了一个更全面、可解释的框架，帮助理解深度学习模型如何编码人类定义的概念。

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code

### [15] [Generalizable Object Re-Identification via Visual In-Context Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21222)
*Zhizhong Huang,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VICP是一个无需参数调整的视觉上下文提示框架，通过结合大语言模型和视觉基础模型，使模型能够仅使用少量上下文示例就能泛化到未见过的物体重识别类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前物体重识别方法需要为每个特定领域训练模型，缺乏泛化能力且需要大量标注数据。自监督学习虽然减少标注需求，但难以捕捉身份敏感特征。

Method: VICP框架使用LLM从少量正负样本对中推断语义身份规则，然后通过动态视觉提示指导VFM（如DINO）提取身份判别特征，将LLM的语义概念与VFM的预训练先验对齐。

Result: 在ShopID10K数据集和多个ReID基准测试中，VICP在未见类别上明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VICP通过视觉上下文提示实现了对未见类别的零样本泛化，消除了数据集特定重新训练的需求，为物体重识别提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究使用SegResNet模型在PANTHER挑战赛的两个MRI胰腺肿瘤分割任务中表现一般（Task 1 DSC 0.56，Task 2 DSC 0.33），凸显了小数据集和不同MRI序列带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤的精确分割对诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但由于解剖结构变异性和数据集有限，自动化分割仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 采用Auto3DSeg架构中的SegResNet模型，通过5折交叉验证和STAPLE集成方法，在解剖相关感兴趣区域进行训练。Task 1使用91例T1加权动脉对比增强MRI，Task 2使用50例T2加权MR-Linac病例。

Result: Task 1：DSC 0.56，5 mm DSC 0.73，HD95 41.1 mm，MASD 26.0 mm，RMSE 5164 mm；Task 2：DSC 0.33，5 mm DSC 0.50，HD95 20.1 mm，MASD 7.2 mm，RMSE 17203 mm。Task 2性能明显下降。

Conclusion: 结果显示了小数据集MRI胰腺肿瘤分割的挑战性，不同MRI序列引入的变异性显著。尽管性能一般，但证明了自动化分割的潜力，强调需要更大、标准化的MRI数据集来提高模型鲁棒性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reverse Imaging是一种基于物理原理的心脏MRI数据增强方法，通过逆向推断底层自旋属性来解决不同成像序列间的泛化问题，显著提升分割模型的跨域性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的心脏MRI预训练分割模型难以在不同成像序列间泛化，主要原因是图像对比度的显著差异。虽然成像协议不同，但相同的自旋物理属性（质子密度、T1、T2值）支配着所有获取的图像

Method: 提出Reverse Imaging方法：1）通过解决非线性逆问题从观测图像逆向推断底层自旋属性；2）利用扩散模型学习自旋属性的先验分布；3）基于推断的自旋属性合成任意新序列的图像

Result: 该方法能够从MRI图像中获得近似但有意义的自旋属性估计，作为可解释的潜变量，实现高度灵活的图像合成。实验表明该方法能够在完全不同图像对比度和成像协议下实现高精度分割

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging通过物理驱动的数据增强和域适应方法，从根本上解决了心脏MRI分割的泛化问题，实现了宽谱泛化的心脏MRI分割

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHD是一种新颖的个性化3D人体网格恢复方法，通过用户特定的体型信息来提高视频姿态估计精度，使用点扩散变换器作为体型条件化的3D姿态先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人体网格恢复方法为了泛化性而设计为与用户无关，但这种方法在优化2D对齐时会牺牲3D精度，无法同时考虑个体体型差异和3D姿态的合理性。

Method: 首先校准用户体型，然后基于该体型进行个性化姿态拟合。使用点扩散变换器实现体型条件化的3D姿态先验，通过点蒸馏采样损失迭代指导姿态拟合过程。

Result: 该方法不仅提高了骨盆对齐的姿态精度，还改善了绝对姿态精度（先前工作常忽视的重要指标），且仅需合成数据进行训练，数据效率高。

Conclusion: PHD是一个即插即用的模块，可以无缝集成到现有的3D姿态估计器中提升性能，有效减轻了对2D约束的过度依赖带来的误差。

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

TL;DR: 基于潜在液散模型的单图到三维场景生成方法，能够从单张图像生成包含遮挡部分的完整3D场景


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Gaussian splatting方法需要密集观测数据且无法处理遮挡和未观测区域，因此需要一种能够从单张图像生成完整场景的方法

Method: 使用变分自动编码器(VAR)从2D图像中自盛益习学习潜在空间，然后在该潜在空间上训练液散模型，以生成条件于单张输入图像的3D表示分布

Result: 方法能够生成准确的重建结果和多样化样本，具有完成遮挡表面的能力，生成高质量的360度渲染结果

Conclusion: 通过生成式方法有效解决了从单张图像重建完整三维场景的挑战，避免了传统回归方法的模糊性和不真实性问题

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

Motivation: 传播模型在生成高保真度3D人体姿势方面表现优异，但其迭代性质和多假设要求导致计算成本较高，需要提高效率。

Method: 提出了分层时间剪枝（HTP）策略，包括：1）时间相关性增强剪枝（TCEP）通过适配时间图构建识别关键帧；2）稀疏聚焦时间注意力（SFT MHSA）利用帧级稀疏性降低计算；3）面具导向姿势令片剪枝器（MGPTP）通过聚类保留最信息丰富的姿势令片。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上，HTP减少训练MACs 38.5%，推理MACs 56.8%，推理速度提升81.1%，同时达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该案件通过动态剪枝策略有效降低了传播模型的计算复杂度，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了效率，为高效的3D人体姿估计提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCT技术能获取高分辨率3D指纹数据，但数据采集成本高、耗时长，导致大规模数据集稀缺，阻碍了深度学习模型的发展

Method: 三阶段框架：1）2D风格转换模块将二值指纹转为灰度图像；2）3D结构扩展网络将2D图像外推为3D解剖体积；3）基于3D GAN的OCT真实感细化器添加纹理和噪声

Result: 生成了42万个合成样本，通过在合成数据上预训练并在小规模真实数据上微调，将EER从15.62%显著降低到2.50%

Conclusion: Print2Volume框架有效解决了OCT指纹数据稀缺问题，生成的合成数据质量高，能显著提升生物识别性能

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

Conclusion: 手术器械分割可以达到较高精度，但由于手术器械固有的高度相似性，多类器械识别仍然是一个重大挑战

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

autoencoders (MAE) and achieves competitive results in multiple benchmarks.
  We also provide a rigorous ablation study evaluating SatDINO's individual

Conclusion: 该框架为WSI集成了详细的组织地图元数据，有效解决了大规模WSI集合的内容标注和选择问题，推进了医学图像AI研究的发展。

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

Method: 提出MedShift模型，基于Flow Matching和Schrodinger Bridges构建统一的类条件生成模型，学习域无关的共享潜在空间，支持训练期间见过的任意域对之间的无缝转换。

Result: 实验结果表明，MedShift相比基于扩散的方法具有更小的模型尺寸，但性能强劲，推理时灵活可调，可以在感知保真度和结构一致性之间进行权衡。

Conclusion: MedShift为医学成像中的域适应提供了一个可扩展和可泛化的解决方案，能够有效弥合合成与真实医学图像之间的域差距。

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在本地设备部署时计算需求高的问题，开发轻量级但性能相当的图像描述模型。

Method: 基于125M参数语言模型构建专家模型，并通过Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架增强视觉定位能力，使用DeepLens提取详细视觉表示。

Conclusion: 轻量级专家模型可作为设备端应用的强大视觉专家，Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架显著提升了描述质量。

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia

underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to
full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard
federated averaging. Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in
decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide
future method development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多仅关注单一技术或在特定类型的OOD数据集上评估，忽视了结合多种现有解决方案的潜力。

Method: 结合独立特征截断技术和多种评分函数，提出多方法集成(MME)评分函数，将多个独立OOD检测器统一为一个更有效的评分函数。

Result: 在大规模和小规模标准测试集上，涵盖近距离和远距离OOD场景，MME在所有标准测试集上显著超过最新的方法。在ImageNet-1K标准测试集上实现平均FPR95为27.57%，比最佳基准提升了6%。

Conclusion: 结合多种独立方法可以显著提升OOD检测性能，MME评分函数为安全关键应用中的神经网络提供了更可靠的开放世界运行能力。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

Motivation: 现有的数据变换方法在提升对抗样本迁移性时，过度增强图像背景或无关区域会引入不必要的干扰，导致目标检测模型出现误检，这些错误并非由对抗补丁本身引起。

Method: 提出局部增强方法，仅对目标区域应用增强，避免影响非目标区域。通过减少背景干扰，使损失函数更直接关注对抗补丁对检测模型的影响。

Result: 在HRSC2016数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效提高了对抗性补丁攻击的成功率，并增强了其迁移性。

Conclusion: 局部增强方法能够有效提升对抗攻击效果，通过精确控制增强区域来优化攻击性能，为遥感图像目标检测的安全性提供了新的防御思路。

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面取得显著进展，但仍容易产生与视频输入不一致或无关的幻觉内容。现有基准主要关注短视频，且对幻觉原因的归因过于简化，忽略了语义聚合过程中的幻觉问题。

Method: 引入ELV-Halluc基准专门研究长视频幻觉；分析语义聚合幻觉(SAH)的特性；采用位置编码策略和DPO（直接偏好优化）策略来缓解SAH；构建包含8K对抗数据对的数据集。

Result: 实验证实了SAH的存在，并发现其随语义复杂性增加而增加；模型在语义快速变化时更容易产生SAH；通过位置编码和DPO策略，在ELV-Halluc和Video-MME基准上均取得改进，SAH比例大幅减少27.7%。

Conclusion: 长视频中的语义聚合幻觉是一个重要但被忽视的问题，需要专门的基准和方法来解决。位置编码和DPO策略被证明是缓解SAH的有效方法，为改善视频多模态模型的幻觉问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

Method: 训练一个卷积神经网络，参考输入图像将低分辨率（大patch尺寸）的基础模型特征进行上采样，无需额外训练即可应用于各种显微镜图像的特征提取和分割

Result: 该方法能够有效分离难以分割的相（如发丝裂纹），交互式分割使用这些深度特征能够以更少的标签和更快的速度产生高质量的分割结果，优于传统的卷积网络训练或微调

Conclusion: 提出的上采样器网络能够高效利用基础模型的丰富语义特征，显著提升显微镜图像分割的性能和效率，为材料科学和生物图像分析提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

Conclusion: 结合CLIP先验知识和不确定性感知采样，为成对排序提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

Motivation: 随着可穿戴设备的普及，从第一人称视角建模人-物交互是一个重要但尚未充分探索的问题。研究如何从最小化的头部和手腕追踪信息中恢复交互信息。

Method: 采用Diffusion Transformer架构和独特的三变量扩散过程，在头部中心规范空间中操作，使用基于传送带的推理方法处理任意长度序列。

Result: 通过广泛评估，ECHO在自我中心人-物交互重建方面超越了现有方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ECHO首次提出了从最小化观测中统一恢复三种模态的框架，为可穿戴设备的人-物交互建模提供了灵活有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了视觉-语言模型在城市场景空间推理任务上的性能，通过构建合成VQA数据集并使用链式思绩答案进行微调，显著提升了模型在否定和反事实等关键问题上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型在通用场景上训练后在城市领域的空间推理能力转移效果不明，需要系统性评估和提升方法。

Method: 构建城市场景的合成VQA数据集，使用分割、深度和目标检测结果生成问题，配合LLM生成的链式思绩答案进行微调训练。对BLIP-2、InstructBLIP和LLaVA-1.5三个模型进行零样本测试和微调对比。

Result: 零样本情况下VLMs表现良好，但使用合成CoT监督数据集微调后性能显著提升，特别是在否定和反事实等关键问题类型上。

Conclusion: 城市空间推理是VLMs的新挑战，通过合成数据集构建是将通用模型适配到专业领域的有效途径。

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Temporal Flow Matching (TFM)方法，用于医学图像的时间动态建模，能够进行细粒度空间预测，支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样，在三个公共纵向数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法大多只考虑单一时间上下文，或专注于分类回归任务，无法进行细粒度空间预测，且往往局限于单时间点、特定疾病或有其他技术限制。

Method: Temporal Flow Matching (TFM)是一种统一的生成轨迹方法，旨在学习底层时间分布，设计上可以回退到最近图像预测器，支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样。

Result: 在三个公共纵向数据集上的广泛基准测试表明，TFM始终超越自然成像中的时空方法，为4D医学图像预测建立了新的最先进和鲁棒的基线。

Conclusion: TFM解决了医学成像中时间动态建模的基本差距，提供了一个强大的框架用于疾病进展建模、治疗计划和解剖发展跟踪等应用。

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了通过深度学习整合预前CT和本后病理全手片图像来预测胆色细胞肾癌复发风险的多模态方法，证明了中间融合策略的效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Leibovich评分在胆色细胞肾癌复发风险分层中存在病人级别分辨率有限且缺少形态学信息的问题，需要更个性化的预测方法。

Method: 采用模块化深度学习框架，结合预训练的编码器和Cox生存分析模型，测试了单模态、后期融合和中间融合等不同策略。

Result: 病理图像基础模型表现明显优于CT模型，中间融合策略进一步提升了性能，最佳模型接近调整后的Leibovich评分。

Conclusion: 证明了基础模型基于多模态整合进行个性化风险预测的可行性，未来需要探索更表达力强的融合策略和更大的多模态数据集。

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

Motivation: 解决现有深度学习方法在计算机生成全息术中的三个主要问题：端到端网络忽视物理关系、CNN感受野有限、角谱方法局限于有限近场。

Method: 采用深度展开网络框架，将梯度下降分解为自适应带宽保持模型(ABPM)和相位域复值去噪器(PCD)，其中PCD使用复值可变形自注意力模块捕获全局特征。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上实现了超过35dB的PSNR，达到了最先进的性能，且相比角谱方法具有更宽的工作距离。

Conclusion: 所提出的深度展开网络通过结合物理模型和深度学习，在计算机生成全息术中实现了更好的重建精度、解释性和灵活性，为CGH提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 解决全身PET/CT洞守分割中的挑战，如追踪剂异质性、生理吸收和多中心变异性，并支持临床工作流中的人机交互精细化分割结果。

Method: 扩展nnU-Net框架为可提示模型，将用户提供的前景和背景点击编码为额外输入通道，系统研究空间提示表征方法，并提出在线模拟用户交互和自定义点采样策略。

Result: 基于EDT编码的模型集成在交叉验证中表现最佳，与基准模型相比显著减少了假阻性和漏检错误。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了可提示模型在多追踪剂、多中心PET/CT中支持高效用户导向分割工作流的潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的概率投影机制，通过置信度分数来改进从图像空间到BEV空间的映射精度，过滤不相关元素并改进时序处理，在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有HD地图构建方法使用标准映射技术（如基于注意力的方法）存在泛化问题，经常产生不存在的道路元素幻觉，映射精度不足影响最终矢量化HD地图质量。

Method: 基于相机参数的几何映射，通过新颖的概率投影机制和置信度分数来：(i) 优化映射以更好地与场景对齐；(ii) 过滤不应影响HD地图生成的不相关元素。使用时序处理通过置信度分数选择性累积可靠信息。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集的新划分上实验显示，性能优于最先进方法，表明更好的泛化能力。在nuScenes和具有挑战性的长感知范围上改进尤为显著。

Conclusion: 提出的概率投影机制通过置信度分数有效提高了从图像到BEV空间的映射精度，解决了现有方法的泛化问题，在HD地图构建任务中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

TL;DR: FLORA是一个轻量级的合成数据生成管道，使用LoRA微调Flux 1.1扩散模型，仅需消费级GPU和500张合成图像就能在目标检测任务上超越需要5000张合成图像和V100 GPU的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型需要大量计算资源和合成图像进行数据增强的问题，使合成数据生成更加高效和实用。

Method: 使用Flux 1.1 Dev扩散模型，通过Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)进行微调，大幅降低计算需求。

Result: 在7个不同的目标检测数据集上，仅用500张合成图像训练的检测器性能优于使用5000张合成图像的ODGEN基线，mAP@.50:.95提升高达21.3%。

Conclusion: FLORA证明了通过质量和效率导向的方法，可以用更少的数据和计算成本实现最先进的性能，使合成数据生成更加实用和易于获取。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有对抗性攻击检测方法需要重新训练模型、修改网络结构或影响干净输入的准确率，需要一种无需修改模型就能实时检测的方法

Method: 在VGG-16网络的早期卷积层并行监控激活熵值变化，利用对抗性输入会导致激活熵增加7%的特性进行检测

Result: 实现了90%的检测准确率，假阳性和假阴性率均低于20%，干净输入和对抗性输入的熵值分布完全分离

Conclusion: CNN激活熵可以作为可靠的对抗性攻击检测指标，使视觉系统能够在保持原有性能的同时实现实时自诊断

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

Motivation: 评估CLIP等基础模型的域泛化能力具有挑战性，因为网络规模的预训练数据可能覆盖了许多现有基准测试。当前的域泛化评估可能既不够挑战性，也无法充分测试真正未见过的数据场景

Method: 提出CLIP-DCA方法：1）使用单独的域头识别和增强CLIP编码器中的域感知能力；2）通过合成生成的多样化域数据；3）同时通过从域特征中解耦来鼓励域不变分类

Result: CLIP-DCA在具有挑战性的评估中相比现有方法显示出显著改进，特别是在更OOD的数据集上表现更好

Conclusion: 增强域感知是基础模型中实现有效域不变分类的前提条件，CLIP-DCA通过解耦分类和增强域感知表示的方法成功解决了CLIP在域泛化中的性能问题

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

Conclusion: 非典型视频数据对开放世界视觉表示学习具有显著益处，提出的新数据集鼓励该方向的进一步研究。

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种无监督视频持续学习(uVCL)方法，通过核密度估计和新奇检测来处理无标签、无任务边界的视频学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频数据复杂丰富但在无监督持续学习领域研究不足，而现有方法依赖标签和任务边界知识，在实际应用中成本高且不实用。

Method: 使用无监督视频Transformer网络提取深度特征，通过核密度估计(KDE)构建非参数概率表示，采用新奇检测来动态扩展内存集群并利用过往任务进行过渡学习。

Result: 在UCF101、HMDB51和Something-to-Something V2三个标准视频数据集上进行深度评估，方法在连续学习多个任务时显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了无监督视频持续学习的挑战，为处理无标签、无任务边界的视频数据提供了可行的非参数化解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

TL;DR: 基于nnU-Net框架，采用多阶段级联预训练策略，通过数据增强和模型集成方法，在胰腺导管腺癌MRI分割任务中取得了优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌MRI自动分割面临肿瘤组织对比度差和标注数据稀缺的挑战，需要开发在有限数据下高性能的专门化模型

Method: 使用nnU-Net框架，采用深度多阶段级联预训练策略：从通用解剖基础模型开始，依次在CT胰腺病变数据集和目标MRI模态上微调。通过五折交叉验证评估数据增强方案，构建异构专家模型集成

Result: Task 1获得0.661的Tumor Dice分数，Task 2获得0.523的Tumor Dice分数。Task 1达到最先进的MASD 5.46 mm和HD95 17.33 mm边界精度

Conclusion: 提出了一种在有限数据和复杂医学成像任务中开发专门化高性能模型的稳健方法，通过度量感知集成策略有效解决了数据增强的权衡问题

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现出色，在多项选择题测试中准确率达到92.8%，显著优于GPT-4和GPT-3.5，在真实病例治疗建议生成中也获得较高评分，但仍需专家监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-5在放射肿瘤学临床决策支持中的性能，特别是与先前模型版本相比的改进程度。

Method: 使用两个基准测试：300道多项选择题的ACR放射肿瘤学培训考试，以及60个真实放射肿瘤病例的治疗计划生成，由4名认证放射肿瘤学家评估正确性、完整性和幻觉情况。

Result: GPT-5在多项选择题测试中准确率92.8%，显著优于GPT-4(78.8%)和GPT-3.5(62.1%)；在病例评估中正确性评分3.24/4，完整性评分3.59/4，幻觉罕见但存在实质性错误。

Conclusion: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现优异，但生成的临床建议仍需专家严格监督，特别是在复杂场景和精确试验知识方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

TL;DR: TMUAD是一个三记忆库框架，通过文本记忆库、对象级图像记忆库和补丁级记忆库的统一协作，实现了结构和逻辑异常检测的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法主要依赖精心设计的图像特征提取器和记忆库来捕捉对象间的逻辑关系，但在正常数据有限的情况下，逻辑异常检测仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出三记忆库框架：1）类级文本记忆库通过逻辑感知文本提取器获取对象逻辑描述；2）对象级图像记忆库通过分割对象特征保持完整轮廓；3）补丁级记忆库用于结构异常检测。三个记忆库协同工作，检索相似正常图像并计算多级异常分数。

Result: 在7个公开数据集（工业和医疗领域）上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过统一结构和逻辑异常检测的协作记忆库框架，TMUAD在多个领域数据集上表现出优异的异常检测能力。

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at

Motivation: 视频中对象的细粒度定位和语义理解是视频理解的基础任务，但获取标注数据成本高昂，需要开发高效的数据标注方法和统一的多任务模型。

Method: 提出VoCap模型，使用多模态提示（文本、框、掩码）生成时空掩码和对象描述；通过预处理的真实掩码结合大型视觉语言模型为SAV数据集生成伪标注；在SAV-Caption等数据集上进行大规模训练。

Conclusion: VoCap提供了一个统一的多任务视频理解框架，通过创新的伪标注方法解决了数据稀缺问题，在多个视频理解任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made
available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将动词分类视为单标签问题，但视觉事件识别存在固有歧义性，同一图像可能被多个动词类别合理描述，这种单标签设定无法处理语义重叠问题。

Method: 将动词分类重新定义为单正例多标签学习(SPMLL)问题，提出Graph Enhanced Verb Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP)模型，结合图神经网络捕捉标签相关性和对抗训练优化决策边界。

Result: 在真实数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在保持传统top-1和top-5准确率指标竞争力的同时，实现了超过3%的平均精度均值(MAP)提升。

Conclusion: 动词分类本质上是一个多标签问题，提出的SPMLL框架和GE-VerbMLP模型有效解决了视觉场景识别中的语义重叠挑战，为场景识别研究提供了新的多标签评估基准。

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

TL;DR: DriveQA是一个全面的开源文本和视觉基准测试，用于评估LLM和MLLM在驾驶知识测试中的表现，发现现有模型在数值推理、复杂路权场景等方面存在显著弱点，但通过微调可以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶基准测试主要关注空间和视觉问答任务，但缺乏对交通规则、标志和路权原则的全面理解评估。人类驾驶员需要识别现实数据集中罕见的边缘案例，因此需要更全面的驾驶知识测试基准。

Method: 提出了DriveQA基准测试，包含文本和视觉版本(DriveQA-V)，涵盖交通法规和场景的全面测试。通过实验评估最先进的LLM和MLLM模型，并进行微调实验和环境因素敏感性分析。

Result: (1) 现有模型在基本交通规则上表现良好，但在数值推理、复杂路权场景、交通标志变化和空间布局方面存在显著弱点；(2) 在DriveQA上微调可提高多个类别的准确性，特别是在监管标志识别和交叉口决策方面；(3) DriveQA-V的环境变化分析揭示了模型对光照、视角、距离和天气条件的敏感性；(4) 在DriveQA上预训练可提升下游驾驶任务性能，在nuScenes和BDD等真实数据集上表现更好。

Conclusion: DriveQA提供了一个全面的驾驶知识评估基准，揭示了当前LLM/MLLM在驾驶理解方面的局限性，同时证明了通过适当的训练可以显著提升模型在交通规则理解和复杂驾驶场景处理方面的能力，为自动驾驶系统的知识基础建设提供了重要工具。

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易学习训练数据中的伪相关性，利用这些非目标特征进行预测，导致性能下降和泛化能力差，需要一种通用方法来同时解决多种偏见并增强分布外鲁棒性

Method: 提出CounterBias Augmentation (CoBA)框架，在语义三元组层面操作：首先将文本分解为主语-谓语-宾语三元组，然后选择性修改这些三元组以破坏伪相关性，最后从调整后的三元组重构文本生成反偏见数据

Result: 通过大量实验证明，CoBA不仅提高了下游任务性能，还有效减少了偏见并增强了分布外鲁棒性

Conclusion: CoBA提供了一个通用且鲁棒的解决方案，能够有效应对伪相关性带来的挑战，为提升模型公平性和泛化能力提供了有力工具

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in
training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions.
Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on
unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of
counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which
simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and
enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias
Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:
first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively
modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the
text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that
mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively
reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a
versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了重要的数据集资源来支持误导性可视化检测的研究，并表明该领域仍需要进一步的技术发展来解决这一重要问题。

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

Abstract: A lack of demographic context in existing toxic speech datasets limits our
understanding of how different age groups communicate online. In collaboration
with funk, a German public service content network, this research introduces
the first large-scale German dataset annotated for toxicity and enriched with
platform-provided age estimates. The dataset includes 3,024 human-annotated and
30,024 LLM-annotated anonymized comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
To ensure relevance, comments were consolidated using predefined toxic
keywords, resulting in 16.7\% labeled as problematic. The annotation pipeline
combined human expertise with state-of-the-art language models, identifying key
categories such as insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees.
The dataset reveals age-based differences in toxic speech patterns, with
younger users favoring expressive language and older users more often engaging
in disinformation and devaluation. This resource provides new opportunities for
studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports the development
of more equitable and age-aware content moderation systems.

Motivation: 现有的笔迹生成方法在捕捉全局依赖关系和文本-笔划对齐方面存在不足，需要开发能够更好处理这些问题的模型。

Method: 提出基于Transformer的TrInk模型，在交叉注意力模块中引入缩放位置嵌入和高斯记忆掩码来改善对齐，并设计了主客观评估流程来全面评估生成笔迹的可读性和风格一致性。

Result: 在IAM-OnDB数据集上，相比之前方法实现了35.56%的字符错误率降低和29.66%的词错误率降低。

Conclusion: TrInk模型通过创新的注意力机制设计，显著提升了笔迹生成的质量和准确性，证明了Transformer架构在笔迹生成任务中的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose TrInk, a Transformer-based model for ink
generation, which effectively captures global dependencies. To better
facilitate the alignment between the input text and generated stroke points, we
introduce scaled positional embeddings and a Gaussian memory mask in the
cross-attention module. Additionally, we design both subjective and objective
evaluation pipelines to comprehensively assess the legibility and style
consistency of the generated handwriting. Experiments demonstrate that our
Transformer-based model achieves a 35.56\% reduction in character error rate
(CER) and an 29.66% reduction in word error rate (WER) on the IAM-OnDB dataset
compared to previous methods. We provide an demo page with handwriting samples
from TrInk and baseline models at: https://akahello-a11y.github.io/trink-demo/

Motivation: 研究认知偏见（特别是锚定效应）在LLM中的表现，评估LLM在现实应用中的可靠性

Method: 使用卖家LLM代理应用锚定效应，通过客观和主观指标评估谈判结果，分析推理和人格因素对锚定效应的影响

Result: LLM像人类一样受锚定效应影响；推理模型较不易受影响（长思维链减轻效应）；人格特质与锚定效应敏感性无显著相关性

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于深入理解LLM中的认知偏见，促进LLM在社会中安全负责任的应用

Abstract: Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs,
affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates
the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we
instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated
negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.
Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like
humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring
effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that
reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the
long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant
correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring
effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases
in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in
society.

Motivation: 评估多模态大语言模型在简单感知任务上的表现，现有研究主要集中在复杂任务而忽视了基础视觉感知能力。

Method: 创建包含30个类别、7200张程序生成图像的Percept-V数据集，测试GPT-4o、Gemini、Claude等先进MLLMs和LRMs的性能。

Result: 实验显示所有模型性能随问题复杂度增加而显著下降，不同类别表现出相似准确率趋势，某些认知技能比其他技能更难。

Conclusion: MLLMs在复杂任务上表现出色，但在基础视觉感知任务上存在明显缺陷，需要改进基础感知能力。

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM评估存在显著标签偏见：Claude标签总是提高评分，Gemini标签总是降低评分，虚假标签可导致排名反转和评分大幅波动，需要盲评或多模型评估协议确保公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地用于评估输出，但其判断可能受到偏见影响。本研究旨在检验ChatGPT、Gemini和Claude在自我评估和交叉模型评估中的偏见问题。

Method: 使用三种模型（ChatGPT、Gemini、Claude）生成的博客文章，在四种标签条件下（无标签、真实标签、两种虚假标签）进行评估，采用整体偏好投票和三个质量维度（连贯性、信息性、简洁性）的评分，所有分数转换为百分比以便直接比较。

Result: 发现明显不对称性："Claude"标签始终提高分数，"Gemini"标签始终降低分数，与内容无关。虚假标签经常导致排名反转，偏好投票变化达50个百分点，质量评分变化达12个百分点。Gemini在真实标签下自我评分崩溃，Claude的自我偏好增强。

Conclusion: 感知到的模型身份会严重扭曲高级判断并微妙影响详细质量评分，强调需要盲评或多模型评估协议来确保LLM基准测试的公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在多轮对话中智能地主动收集信息的问题，提升模型作为对话代理的效果性

Method: 基于序贪贝叶斯实验设计框架，迭代选择最大化预期信息收益的问题，包括精心设计的EIG估计器、非仅依靠上下文更新的条件化方式和有目标的查询提出策略

Result: 在20问题游戏和用户偏好推断任务中，BED-LLM在性能上实现了显著提升，超越了直接提示和其他适应性设计策略

Conclusion: BED-LLM为大语言模型提供了一种原理性的方法来智能地主动收集信息，在多种任务中都取得了显著成效，为构建更有效的对话式AI系统开启了新方向

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

Motivation: 传统HFACS人工因素分析方法存在可扩展性和一致性限制，需要自动化解决方案来提升航空事故分析的效率和准确性。

Method: 采用强化学习GRPO优化Llama-3.1 8B语言模型，结合多组件奖励系统和合成数据生成技术处理类别不平衡问题。

Result: 模型性能显著提升：精确匹配准确率提高350%（0.04→0.18），部分匹配准确率达0.88，超越GPT-5-mini和Gemini-2.5-fiash等先进模型。

Conclusion: 领域优化的小型模型可为关键安全分析提供计算效率更高、性能更好的解决方案，适合在资源受限的边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型容易受到多语言字母表字符扰动的拼写攻击，导致性能显著下降，这主要源于子词分词器及其嵌入的词汇表外问题

Method: 使用基于像素的生成语言模型，将单词渲染为单个图像，替代传统的基于文本的嵌入表示

Result: 在多语言LAMBADA数据集、WMT24数据集和SST-2基准测试中评估，证明了对拼写噪声的鲁棒性和在多语言环境中的有效性

Conclusion: 像素表示方法为语言模型提供了更强的噪声输入鲁棒性，并扩展了对多样化书写系统的多语言文本兼容性

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where
input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to
substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from
the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their
embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative
language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based
representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides
stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to
multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed
method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2
benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its
effectiveness in multilingual settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自监督语音模型是否像人类一样表现出关键期效应，即第二语言学习难度随接触时间延迟而增加，以及第一语言保持能力随接触时间延长而增强。

Method: 在儿童导向语音数据上训练自监督语音模型，控制第二语言训练开始时间和第一语言训练结束时间，评估模型的音素辨别性能。

Result: 自监督语音模型未显示出明确的关键期效应证据。延迟第二语言接触的模型在第二语言上表现更好，延迟第一语言接触偏移会导致第一语言遗忘。

Conclusion: 自监督语音模型在语音习得方面不表现出人类语言关键期效应的特征，这与基于文本的语言模型研究结果不同，表明语音和文本处理机制可能存在差异。

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human
language acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP
effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with
delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1)
with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects
using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains
underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language
acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training
offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination
performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP
effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2
exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset
leads to L1 forgetting.

Result: 实验显示DMP实现高达3倍的速度提升，且AUROC性能没有损失

Conclusion: DMP能有效提升多响应生成效率，且与模型、数据集、解码策略和自一致性基线正交，有望扩展到对齐和推理任务

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds
promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC
performance.

TL;DR: 本文通过'正常性'概念重新审视图灵测试，认为图灵测试针对的是正常/平均人类智能而非卓越智能，需要机器像正常人一样犯错。同时图灵测试是统计测试，由陪审团而非单个法官判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新解读图灵测试的哲学基础，探讨其对人工智能评估的真正意义，特别是针对当前大型语言模型的适用性。

Method: 从统计学和哲学角度分析图灵测试中'正常性'的概念，包括正常智能和正常判断者的双重含义。

Result: 提出ChatGPT等大型语言模型针对的是卓越智能而非正常智能，因此属于'人工聪明'而非真正的人工智能；同时质疑人类心智是否可简化为平均心智。

Conclusion: 图灵测试能否促进对人类认知的理解，取决于人类心智是否真的可简化为正常/平均心智，这超出了图灵测试本身，质疑了其所依赖的正常主义范式。

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

Result: 发现评估指标性能与文献报告存在显著差异；与人类判断对齐度最高的指标往往计算密集且运行稳定性较差；LLM-based方法存在随机性、技术依赖和有限可复现性等问题。

Conclusion: 需要建立更鲁棒的评估协议，包括详尽文档记录和方法论标准化，以确保自动摘要评估的可靠性，同时要谨慎使用LLM-based评估方法。

Abstract: This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text
summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six
representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent
LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies
between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our
experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to
the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of
evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the
highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and
less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key
concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness,
technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more
robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and
methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic
summarization assessment.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了大语言模型在学术同行审查中的应用，发现当前自动审查生成器无法有效识别研究逻辑缺陷，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在学术同行审查中的应用增多，需要识别其潜在偏差和系统性错误，以维护科学完整性。研究重点关注审查的核心技能：检测研究逻辑缺陷。

Method: 研究者开发了一个全自动的假设性评估框架，在受控条件下隔离和测试自动审查生成器的逻辑检测能力。测试了多种ARG方法。

Result: 结果显示，与预期相反，研究逻辑中的缺陷对自动审查生成器的输出评审没有显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究为将来工作提出了三个可操作的建议，并公开释放了假设性数据集和评估框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support
scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review
generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose
significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on
a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting
faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency
between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully
automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this
skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find
that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant
effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three
actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual
dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注通用MLLM能力或作为求解器评估，缺乏针对医学场景中诊断准确性和临床相关性等关键维度的专门评估基准，医学奖励模型和评判器研究不足。

Method: 构建包含1026个专家标注多模态医学案例的数据集，采用严格的三步流程确保高质量评估数据，覆盖13个器官系统和8个临床科室，在6个临床关键维度上评估32个先进MLLM模型。

Result: 评估显示现有模型在输出与专家判断对齐方面存在显著挑战，同时开发的基线模型通过微调实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench填补了医学奖励模型评估的空白，为医学MLLM的可靠评估提供了重要基准，揭示了当前模型在临床对齐方面的不足，并展示了微调改进的潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义维度分析方法通常依赖预定义的粗粒度维度，忽略了更精细的概念区分，需要开发能够揭示语义结构底层子维度的新方法。

Method: 提出DCSRM模型，将大语言模型的词嵌入分解为多个子嵌入，每个编码特定语义信息；使用体素编码模型将这些子维度映射到大脑激活模式。

Result: 识别出一组可解释的语义子维度，发现语义维度按不同原则结构化，极性是驱动分解的关键因素；神经相关性验证了子维度的认知和神经科学合理性。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了更细粒度的可解释语义子维度，为理解语言和大脑中意义组织的核心维度提供了新见解。

Abstract: Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to
uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing
approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad
representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes
a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained
semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous
Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from
large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific
semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of
interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we
apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain
activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic
subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic
dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity
emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The
neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and
neuroscientific plausibility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型存在可量化的意识形态深度差异，有些模型容易通过提示工程改变政治立场，而另一些则具有更稳固的内部政治表征结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型意识形态倾向的稳定性和深度，验证表面回应是否能反映连贯的内在意识形态。

Method: 采用双重方法：1) 通过指令提示和激活引导测量模型的可操控性；2) 使用稀疏自编码器分析模型内部机制。

Result: 发现可操控性较低的模型具有更独特和抽象的意识形态特征，一个模型可能包含比同规模模型多7.3倍的政治特征。对深度模型的核心政治特征进行针对性消融会导致跨主题的一致逻辑转变，而浅层模型则只会增加拒绝输出。

Conclusion: 意识形态深度是大语言模型的可量化属性，可操控性可作为窥探其潜在政治架构的重要窗口。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological
leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly
understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple
prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent
underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth"
in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political
representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the
"steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting
and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch
between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an
increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.
Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower
steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our
evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than
another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core
political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent,
logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same
intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.
Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs
and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political
architecture.

TL;DR: 本文提出两种AI驱动的奖励策略，通过RLAIF框架提升7B参数小语言模型的中文问候语创意写作能力，其中基于原则的LLM-as-a-Judge方法在生成质量、训练效率和数据依赖性方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型计算需求高，小语言模型通过监督微调缺乏新颖性，RLHF成本高昂，需要寻找更有效的创意写作增强方法。

Method: 使用RLAIF框架，比较两种策略：1）基于多智能体拒绝采样框架训练的奖励模型；2）采用对抗训练和反思机制优化的原则指导LLM-as-a-Judge方法。

Result: 两种方法都显著提升创意输出，但原则指导的LLM-as-a-Judge方法在生成质量、训练效率和减少人工标注数据依赖方面表现更优，自动化评估与人类判断高度一致。

Conclusion: 基于原则的LLM-as-a-Judge方法为创意小语言模型提供了更可扩展和有效的路径，减少了对人类标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing
capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread
use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but
current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper
explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a
7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first
strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a
novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The
second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose
reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a
reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative
output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields
superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in
training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting
a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated
evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments. Our code

Motivation: 心理偏见使人们容易相信和传播假新闻，集成方法虽然有效但性能严重依赖分类器的多样性，而选择真正多样化的模型仍是一个关键挑战

Method: 首先计算分类器间的成对多样性，应用层次聚类将其组织成不同粒度的组，然后通过HierarchySelect探索层次级别选择每个级别的一个分类器池，最后选择最具多样性的池用于集成构建

Result: 在6个数据集中的2个上实现了最高准确率，优于Elbow启发式方法和现有最先进基线

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效选择多样化的分类器组合，提升假新闻检测集成系统的性能，特别是在处理冗余模式学习问题时表现出色

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

Motivation: 现有数据选择和合成方法存在静态数据集管理的局限性，无法适应模型能力的动态演化，需要建立动态的数据优化系统

Method: 建立闭环优化系统：1）自参考诊断模块通过损失模式（复杂性）、嵌入聚类动态（多样性）和自对齐分数（质量）识别次优样本；2）自适应优化引擎在保持语义完整性的同时将次优样本转化为教学价值高的训练点；3）通过动态学习原理随模型能力持续演化

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法持续提升种子数据质量，平均提高LLM准确率7.15%，同时保持原始数据集规模

Conclusion: 这项工作通过数据和模型的动态人机协同演化，为可持续的LLM训练建立了新范式

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of
seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on
average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a
new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution
of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

Method: 将32名参与者按Keirsey人格类型均匀分配，让他们与GPT-4和Claude 3.5进行四种协作任务（数据分析、创意写作、信息检索、写作辅助），分析偏好和情感反馈

Result: 理性型用户特别偏好GPT-4（目标导向任务），理想型用户特别偏好Claude 3.5（创意和分析任务），其他人格类型偏好依任务而定，总体有用性评分相似

Conclusion: 人格基础的分析能够揭示传统评估方法忽略的LLM差异，为个性化LLM协作提供重要见解

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into everyday
workflows, where users shape outcomes through multi-turn collaboration, a
critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits
systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32
participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types,
evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four
collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval,
and writing assistance. Results revealed significant personality-driven
preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, particularly for goal-oriented
tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and
analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences.
Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably,
aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how
personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations
miss.

Abstract: We present QZhou-Embedding, a general-purpose contextual text embedding model
with exceptional text representation capabilities. Built upon the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model, we designed a unified multi-task
framework comprising specialized data transformation and training strategies.
The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse
textual training datasets, while the task-specific training strategies enhance

LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard
negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample
difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training
strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by
full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities
based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards

Motivation: 解决监督精细调整(SFT)中的"泵法现象"，即无差别的参数更新导致某些任务收益但损害其他任务性能的问题。

Method: 1、独立细调每个任务识别核心参数区域 2、根据区域重叠将任务分组 3、核心参数直接移植到统一背榜 4、非核心参数通过球面线性插值(SLERP)融合 5、轻量级管线式SFT训练，冻结以前任务的核心区域

Result: 在多个公开测试集上实验表明，该方法显著缓解任务干扰和恐怖遗忘问题，持续超过普通多任务和多阶段细调基线方法。

Conclusion: CPI-FT框架通过核心参数隔离和智能融合策略，有效解决了大语言模型多任务调整中的性能平衡问题，为多任务学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language
models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the
``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on
certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework.
Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify
its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks
with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming
clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:
for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are
directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from
different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT
training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing
core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently
outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI研究越来越多地将大语言模型应用于推理密集型回归任务，这类任务需要从文本中进行深度分析来推断数值属性，但现有的冻结LLM提示和Transformer编码器微调方法在此类任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出了MENTAT方法，结合批量反射提示优化（通过分析批次数据动态优化提示）和神经集成学习（整合多个模型的预测），该方法简单轻量且不需要大量任务特定数据。

Result: MENTAT方法在三个现实问题构建的RiR基准测试中，相比冻结LLM提示和Transformer微调两种基线方法，取得了最高65%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 虽然MENTAT在推理密集型回归任务上取得了显著改进，但此类任务仍存在很大的提升空间，需要未来的进一步研究和发展。

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

TL;DR: PiCSAR是一种无需训练的方法，通过联合对数似然对推理和答案进行评分，在数学推理任务上显著优于基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Best-of-n采样需要设计有效的评分函数来识别正确的推理链，而无需真实答案作为参考

Method: 使用推理过程和最终答案的联合对数似然作为评分函数，自然分解为推理置信度和答案置信度

Result: 在MATH500上提升10.18分，AIME2025上提升9.81分，在20次比较中16次以至少2倍更少的样本优于基线

Conclusion: 正确的推理链表现出显著更高的推理和答案置信度，证明了PiCSAR方法的有效性

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on web-scale datasets like Common
Crawl, which provides over 80\% of training data for some modern models.
However, the indiscriminate nature of web crawling raises challenges in data
quality, safety, and ethics. Despite the critical importance of training data
quality, prior research on harmful content has been limited to small samples
due to computational constraints. This project presents a framework for
indexing and analyzing LLM training datasets using an ElasticSearch-based
pipeline. We apply it to SwissAI's FineWeb-2 corpus (1.5TB, four languages),
achieving fast query performance--most searches in milliseconds, all under 2
seconds. Our work demonstrates real-time dataset analysis, offering practical
tools for safer, more accountable AI systems.

Conclusion: EO-1模型和EO-Data1.5M数据集为开发先进具身基础模型提供了有价值的架构、数据构建和训练方法见解

Abstract: The human ability to seamlessly perform multimodal reasoning and physical
interaction in the open world is a core goal for general-purpose embodied
intelligent systems. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are
co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable
progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve
human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work,
introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is
a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in
multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved
vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key
pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs
indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive,
high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains
over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action
comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive
decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot
action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for
open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of
long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This
paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of
EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for
developing advanced embodied foundation models.

Motivation: 解决单目视觉惯性里程计中需要同时估计速度、重力方向和姿态的问题，通过融合光学流测量和IMU数据来提高估计精度和稳定性。

Method: 使用全局指数稳定的Riccati观测器融合光流速度方向信息与陀螺仪、加速度计数据；在SO(3)上设计互补观测器进行姿态估计；开发梯度下降算法从稀疏光流数据中提取速度方向。

Result: 提出的级联观测器架构具有几乎全局渐近稳定性，仿真结果验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了连续单目VIO，通过创新的观测器融合架构和优化算法，为视觉惯性导航提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel cascaded observer architecture that combines
optical flow and IMU measurements to perform continuous monocular
visual-inertial odometry (VIO). The proposed solution estimates body-frame
velocity and gravity direction simultaneously by fusing velocity direction
information from optical flow measurements with gyro and accelerometer data.
This fusion is achieved using a globally exponentially stable Riccati observer,
which operates under persistently exciting translational motion conditions. The
estimated gravity direction in the body frame is then employed, along with an
optional magnetometer measurement, to design a complementary observer on
$\mathbf{SO}(3)$ for attitude estimation. The resulting interconnected observer
architecture is shown to be almost globally asymptotically stable. To extract
the velocity direction from sparse optical flow data, a gradient descent
algorithm is developed to solve a constrained minimization problem on the unit
sphere. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is validated through
simulation results.

TL;DR: 基于最优运输理论和模型预测控制的多机器人路径规划与调度方法，避免路径重叠和死锁


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多机器人在共享空间中导航时，先映射机器人到目标再规划路径容易导致路径重叠和死锁问题

Method: 使用最优运输理论，将空间离散化为K个单元格，构建K×K成本结构，提供最优且不重叠的单元迁移，并集成重新规划和模型预测控制来处理动态问题

Conclusion: 该方法通过最优运输理论有效解决了多机器人路径规划中的路径重叠和死锁问题，并通过模型预测控制处理动态系统需求

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for path planning and
scheduling for multi-robot navigation that is based on optimal transport theory
and model predictive control. We consider a setup where $N$ robots are tasked
to navigate to $M$ targets in a common space with obstacles. Mapping robots to
targets first and then planning paths can result in overlapping paths that lead
to deadlocks. We derive a strategy based on optimal transport that not only
provides minimum cost paths from robots to targets but also guarantees
non-overlapping trajectories. We achieve this by discretizing the space of
interest into $K$ cells and by imposing a ${K\times K}$ cost structure that
describes the cost of transitioning from one cell to another. Optimal transport
then provides \textit{optimal and non-overlapping} cell transitions for the
robots to reach the targets that can be readily deployed without any scheduling
considerations. The proposed solution requires $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^3\log K)$
computations in the worst-case and $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^2\log K)$ for
well-behaved problems. To further accommodate potentially overlapping
trajectories (unavoidable in certain situations) as well as robot dynamics, we
show that a temporal structure can be integrated into optimal transport with
the help of \textit{replans} and \textit{model predictive control}.

Motivation: 传统下肢外骨骼控制器局限于预定义动作和受控环境，限制了其实际应用，需要能够安全处理未知动作的智能控制方法

Method: 使用不确定性估计器（包括模型集成、自编码器和生成对抗网络三种架构）来分类动作是否属于训练集分布内，在线测试中采用表现最好的步态相位估计器集成方法

Result: 在线测试显示不确定性估计器能够在用户从分布内任务转换到分布外任务时准确开启和关闭辅助功能（F1分数：89.2）

Conclusion: 该框架为外骨骼在非结构化日常环境中安全自主地支持人体运动提供了可行路径

Abstract: Lower limb exoskeletons show promise to assist human movement, but their
utility is limited by controllers designed for discrete, predefined actions in
controlled environments, restricting their real-world applicability. We present
an uncertainty-aware control framework that enables ankle exoskeletons to
operate safely across diverse scenarios by automatically disengaging when
encountering unfamiliar movements. Our approach uses an uncertainty estimator
to classify movements as similar (in-distribution) or different
(out-of-distribution) relative to actions in the training set. We evaluated
three architectures (model ensembles, autoencoders, and generative adversarial
networks) on an offline dataset and tested the strongest performing
architecture (ensemble of gait phase estimators) online. The online test
demonstrated the ability of our uncertainty estimator to turn assistance on and
off as the user transitioned between in-distribution and out-of-distribution
tasks (F1: 89.2). This new framework provides a path for exoskeletons to safely
and autonomously support human movement in unstructured, everyday environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文重新审视延迟状态卡尔曼滤波器，证明其与随机克隆方法在处理延迟状态测量时具有相同的状态和协方差更新效果，但计算效率更高且内存需求更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人学和导航中的许多估计问题涉及依赖于先前状态的测量（如里程计），传统方法使用随机克隆来处理这些延迟状态测量的相关性，但该方法需要状态向量扩增，计算和内存开销较大。

Method: 采用广义卡尔曼滤波器公式，推导出能够处理相关延迟状态测量的延迟状态卡尔曼滤波器，无需状态扩增即可准确捕获测量与先前状态估计的相关性。

Result: 证明正确推导的延迟状态卡尔曼滤波器与随机克隆方法产生完全相同的状态和协方差更新结果，同时在计算上更具优势，对高维状态的内存需求也更低。

Conclusion: 研究澄清了卡尔曼滤波器变体无法处理相关延迟状态测量的常见误解，展示了替代公式能够以更高效率实现相同结果，为相关估计问题提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Many estimation problems in robotics and navigation involve measurements that
depend on prior states. A prominent example is odometry, which measures the
relative change between states over time. Accurately handling these
delayed-state measurements requires capturing their correlations with prior
state estimates, and a widely used approach is stochastic cloning (SC), which
augments the state vector to account for these correlations.
  This work revisits a long-established but often overlooked alternative--the
delayed-state Kalman filter--and demonstrates that a properly derived filter
yields exactly the same state and covariance update as SC, without requiring
state augmentation. Moreover, the generalized Kalman filter formulation
provides computational advantages, while also reducing memory requirements for
higher-dimensional states.
  Our findings clarify a common misconception that Kalman filter variants are
inherently unable to handle correlated delayed-state measurements,
demonstrating that an alternative formulation achieves the same results more
efficiently.

Abstract: Autonomous driving applications have become increasingly relevant in the
automotive industry due to their potential to enhance vehicle safety,
efficiency, and user experience, thereby meeting the growing demand for
sophisticated driving assistance features. However, the development of reliable
and trustworthy autonomous systems poses challenges such as high complexity,
prolonged training periods, and intrinsic levels of uncertainty. Mini
Autonomous Cars (MACs) are used as a practical testbed, enabling validation of
autonomous control methodologies on small-scale setups. This simplified and
cost-effective environment facilitates rapid evaluation and comparison of
machine learning models, which is particularly useful for algorithms requiring
online training. To address these challenges, this work presents a methodology
based on RGB-D information and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks
(3D CNNs) for MAC autonomous driving in simulated environments. We evaluate the
proposed approach against recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with architectures
trained and tested on two simulated tracks with distinct environmental
features. Performance was assessed using task completion success, lap-time
metrics, and driving consistency. Results highlight how architectural
modifications and track complexity influence the models' generalization
capability and vehicle control performance. The proposed 3D CNN demonstrated
promising results when compared with RNNs.

Abstract: This paper presents the first comprehensive application of legal-action

legal-action masked DQN with hierarchical architecture that decomposes
Q-function estimation into orientation and position components, reducing
computational complexity from $O(3,132)$ to $O(116) + O(27)$ while maintaining
solution completeness. The robot-friendly reward function encourages
ground-first, vertically accessible assembly sequences aligned with
manipulation constraints. Curriculum learning across three progressive

Conclusion: 所提出的贪婪分配算法在异构传感器多目标跟踪任务中表现出色，提供了理论保证和实际有效性，适用于现实世界的多机器人跟踪应用。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of assigning heterogeneous sensors (i.e.,
robots with varying sensing capabilities) for multi-target tracking. We
classify robots into two categories: (1) sufficient sensing robots, equipped
with range and bearing sensors, capable of independently tracking targets, and
(2) limited sensing robots, which are equipped with only range or bearing
sensors and need to at least form a pair to collaboratively track a target. Our
objective is to optimize tracking quality by minimizing uncertainty in target
state estimation through efficient robot-to-target assignment. By leveraging
matroid theory, we propose a greedy assignment algorithm that dynamically
allocates robots to targets to maximize tracking quality. The algorithm
guarantees constant-factor approximation bounds of 1/3 for arbitrary tracking
quality functions and 1/2 for submodular functions, while maintaining
polynomial-time complexity. Extensive simulations demonstrate the algorithm's
effectiveness in accurately estimating and tracking targets over extended
periods. Furthermore, numerical results confirm that the algorithm's
performance is close to that of the optimal assignment, highlighting its
robustness and practical applicability.

Abstract: Achieving both safety guarantees and real-time performance in cooperative
vehicle coordination remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in dynamic
and uncertain environments. This paper presents a novel coordination framework
that resolves this challenge through three key innovations: 1) direct control
of vehicles' trajectory distributions during coordination, formulated as a
robust cooperative planning problem with adaptive enhanced safety constraints,
ensuring a specified level of safety regarding the uncertainty of the
interactive trajectory, 2) a fully parallel ADMM-based distributed trajectory
negotiation (ADMM-DTN) algorithm that efficiently solves the optimization
problem while allowing configurable negotiation rounds to balance solution
quality and computational resources, and 3) an interactive attention mechanism
that selectively focuses on critical interactive participants to further
enhance computational efficiency. Both simulation results and practical
experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant advantages in
safety (reducing collision rates by up to 40.79\% in various scenarios) and
real-time performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining
strong scalability with increasing vehicle numbers. The proposed interactive
attention mechanism further reduces the computational demand by 14.1\%. The
framework's effectiveness is further validated through real-world experiments
with unexpected dynamic obstacles, demonstrating robust coordination in complex
environments. The experiment demo could be found at

Motivation: 传统模型预测路径积分方法可能陷入局部最优解，无法充分探索多种避障策略（如绕行或停车），需要开发能够考虑多模态轨迹的算法来提高自动驾驶车辆的安全性和决策质量。

Method: 使用多模态模型预测路径积分控制算法，采用Sobol序列在先前输入周围进行采样，结合碰撞避免的解析解。采用带有Fiala轮胎模型的非线性单轨车辆模型作为预测模型，并强制执行摩擦圆内的轮胎力约束以确保车辆稳定性。

Conclusion: 多模态模型预测路径积分控制算法能够有效探索多样化的轨迹选择，提高自动驾驶车辆在复杂场景中的避障能力和稳定性，为解决局部最优问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to motion planning and decision-making
for automated vehicles, using a multi-modal Model Predictive Path Integral
control algorithm. The method samples with Sobol sequences around the prior
input and incorporates analytical solutions for collision avoidance. By
leveraging multiple modes, the multi-modal control algorithm explores diverse
trajectories, such as manoeuvring around obstacles or stopping safely before
them, mitigating the risk of sub-optimal solutions. A non-linear single-track
vehicle model with a Fiala tyre serves as the prediction model, and tyre force
constraints within the friction circle are enforced to ensure vehicle stability
during evasive manoeuvres. The optimised steering angle and longitudinal
acceleration are computed to generate a collision-free trajectory and to
control the vehicle. In a high-fidelity simulation environment, we demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm can successfully avoid obstacles, keeping the
vehicle stable while driving a double lane change manoeuvre on high and
low-friction road surfaces and occlusion scenarios with moving obstacles,
outperforming a standard Model Predictive Path Integral approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人额定负载基于最差配置保守设定，导致整个工作空间内负载能力被严重低估，无法充分利用机器人的实际承载能力。

Method: 使用去噪扩散模型将负载约束显式纳入规划过程，生成动态可行的关节空间轨迹，无需后处理即可直接在物理硬件上执行。

Result: 在7自由度Franka Emika Panda机器人上的实验验证显示，即使负载超过额定容量3倍，仍有67.6%的工作空间可访问。

Conclusion: 该方法显著扩展了机器人的操作范围，强调了在运动规划算法中更细致考虑负载动力学的重要性。

Abstract: Nominal payload ratings for articulated robots are typically derived from
worst-case configurations, resulting in uniform payload constraints across the
entire workspace. This conservative approach severely underutilizes the robot's
inherent capabilities -- our analysis demonstrates that manipulators can safely
handle payloads well above nominal capacity across broad regions of their
workspace while staying within joint angle, velocity, acceleration, and torque
limits. To address this gap between assumed and actual capability, we propose a
novel trajectory generation approach using denoising diffusion models that
explicitly incorporates payload constraints into the planning process. Unlike
traditional sampling-based methods that rely on inefficient trial-and-error,
optimization-based methods that are prohibitively slow, or kinodynamic planners
that struggle with problem dimensionality, our approach generates dynamically
feasible joint-space trajectories in constant time that can be directly
executed on physical hardware without post-processing. Experimental validation
on a 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot demonstrates that up to 67.6% of the
workspace remains accessible even with payloads exceeding 3 times the nominal
capacity. This expanded operational envelope highlights the importance of a
more nuanced consideration of payload dynamics in motion planning algorithms.

Conclusion: RoboInspector成功揭示了LLM在机器人操作策略代码生成中的不可靠性问题，提供了实用的分析和优化方法，为实际开发提供了重要见解，显著提高了策略代码生成的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in reasoning
and code generation, enabling robotic manipulation to be initiated with just a
single instruction. The LLM carries out various tasks by generating policy code
required to control the robot. Despite advances in LLMs, achieving reliable
policy code generation remains a significant challenge due to the diverse
requirements of real-world tasks and the inherent complexity of user
instructions. In practice, different users may provide distinct instructions to
drive the robot for the same task, which may cause the unreliability of policy
code generation. To bridge this gap, we design RoboInspector, a pipeline to
unveil and characterize the unreliability of the policy code for LLM-enabled
robotic manipulation from two perspectives: the complexity of the manipulation
task and the granularity of the instruction. We perform comprehensive
experiments with 168 distinct combinations of tasks, instructions, and LLMs in
two prominent frameworks. The RoboInspector identifies four main unreliable
behaviors that lead to manipulation failure. We provide a detailed
characterization of these behaviors and their underlying causes, giving insight
for practical development to reduce unreliability. Furthermore, we introduce a

Abstract: Socially aware robot navigation is a planning paradigm where the robot
navigates in human environments and tries to adhere to social constraints while
interacting with the humans in the scene. These navigation strategies were
further improved using human prediction models, where the robot takes the
potential future trajectory of humans while computing its own. Though these
strategies significantly improve the robot's behavior, it faces difficulties
from time to time when the human behaves in an unexpected manner. This happens
as the robot fails to understand human intentions and cooperativeness, and the
human does not have a clear idea of what the robot is planning to do. In this
paper, we aim to address this gap through effective communication at an
appropriate time based on a geometric analysis of the context and human
cooperativeness in head-on crossing scenarios. We provide an assessment
methodology and propose some evaluation metrics that could distinguish a
cooperative human from a non-cooperative one. Further, we also show how
geometric reasoning can be used to generate appropriate verbal responses or
robot actions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的神经符号框架，通过结合符号抽象和扩散策略模仿学习，从少量演示中学习连续控制策略和符号领域抽象，实现了高数据效率和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于图的神经符号框架能够捕捉复杂状态转换，包括非空间和时间关系，在有限演示数据集中实现了可解释的决策制定。

Abstract: Imitation learning enables intelligent systems to acquire complex behaviors
with minimal supervision. However, existing methods often focus on
short-horizon skills, require large datasets, and struggle to solve
long-horizon tasks or generalize across task variations and distribution
shifts. We propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework that jointly learns
continuous control policies and symbolic domain abstractions from a few skill
demonstrations. Our method abstracts high-level task structures into a graph,
discovers symbolic rules via an Answer Set Programming solver, and trains
low-level controllers using diffusion policy imitation learning. A high-level
oracle filters task-relevant information to focus each controller on a minimal
observation and action space. Our graph-based neuro-symbolic framework enables
capturing complex state transitions, including non-spatial and temporal
relations, that data-driven learning or clustering techniques often fail to
discover in limited demonstration datasets. We validate our approach in six
domains that involve four robotic arms, Stacking, Kitchen, Assembly, and Towers
of Hanoi environments, and a distinct Automated Forklift domain with two
environments. The results demonstrate high data efficiency with as few as five
skill demonstrations, strong zero- and few-shot generalizations, and
interpretable decision making.

Motivation: 现有的基于采样的规划器在没有找到解时需要重新采样和探索整个配置空间，这非常耗时且计算成本高，需要一种能够加速初始收敛率的方法

Method: 提出多信息树(MIT*)规划器，构建基于先验可接受解成本的估计信息集，采用自适应采样器动态调整采样策略，并使用长度相关的自适应稀疏碰撞检查来指导懒惰反向搜索

Conclusion: MIT*通过创新的信息集构建、自适应采样和碰撞检查策略，显著提高了路径成本效率和计算时间，同时在受限场景中保持高成功率

Abstract: Path planning in robotics often involves solving continuously valued,
high-dimensional problems. Popular informed approaches include graph-based
searches, such as A*, and sampling-based methods, such as Informed RRT*, which
utilize informed set and anytime strategies to expedite path optimization
incrementally. Informed sampling-based planners define informed sets as subsets
of the problem domain based on the current best solution cost. However, when no
solution is found, these planners re-sample and explore the entire
configuration space, which is time-consuming and computationally expensive.
This article introduces Multi-Informed Trees (MIT*), a novel planner that
constructs estimated informed sets based on prior admissible solution costs
before finding the initial solution, thereby accelerating the initial
convergence rate. Moreover, MIT* employs an adaptive sampler that dynamically
adjusts the sampling strategy based on the exploration process. Furthermore,
MIT* utilizes length-related adaptive sparse collision checks to guide lazy
reverse search. These features enhance path cost efficiency and computation
times while ensuring high success rates in confined scenarios. Through a series
of simulations and real-world experiments, it is confirmed that MIT*
outperforms existing single-query, sampling-based planners for problems in R^4
to R^16 and has been successfully applied to real-world robot manipulation
tasks. A video showcasing our experimental results is available at:

Abstract: Traversing narrow gates presents a significant challenge and has become a
standard benchmark for evaluating agile and precise quadrotor flight.
Traditional modularized autonomous flight stacks require extensive design and
parameter tuning, while end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) methods often
suffer from low sample efficiency and limited interpretability. In this work,
we present a novel hybrid framework that adaptively fine-tunes model predictive
control (MPC) parameters online using outputs from a neural network (NN)
trained offline. The NN jointly predicts a reference pose and cost-function
weights, conditioned on the coordinates of the gate corners and the current
drone state. To achieve efficient training, we derive analytical policy
gradients not only for the MPC module but also for an optimization-based gate
traversal detection module. Furthermore, we introduce a new formulation of the
attitude tracking error that admits a simplified representation, facilitating
effective learning with bounded gradients. Hardware experiments demonstrate
that our method enables fast and accurate quadrotor traversal through narrow
gates in confined environments. It achieves several orders of magnitude
improvement in sample efficiency compared to naive end-to-end RL approaches.

Motivation: 工业机械臂在杂乱环境中运行时面临模型不确定性带来的安全挑战，常规方法需限制速度以保证安全，需要新方法在高速运动下供安全保证

Method: 提出结合突凸模型预测控制(MPC)的方案，包含两个核心组件：管式MPC用于处理模型不确定性，管道规划算法用于获取碰撞免除运动

Result: 在6臂工业机器人模拟环境中进行测试，在模型参数不确定的杂乱环境下，方法能够在更高的不确定性水平下工作，同时实现更快的运动速度，超过了对照方法

Conclusion: 该方法通过突凸MPC形式实现快速求解，具有实际应用价值，为工业机械臂在复杂环境中的安全高速运动提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Industrial manipulators are normally operated in cluttered environments,
making safe motion planning important. Furthermore, the presence of
model-uncertainties make safe motion planning more difficult. Therefore, in
practice the speed is limited in order to reduce the effect of disturbances.
There is a need for control methods that can guarantee safe motions that can be
executed fast. We address this need by suggesting a novel model predictive
control (MPC) solution for manipulators, where our two main components are a
robust tube MPC and a corridor planning algorithm to obtain collision-free
motion. Our solution results in a convex MPC, which we can solve fast, making
our method practically useful. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in a
simulated environment with a 6 DOF industrial robot operating in cluttered
environments with uncertainties in model parameters. We outperform benchmark
methods, both in terms of being able to work under higher levels of model
uncertainties, while also yielding faster motion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究行人之间的"人行道尴尬舞"现象（相互避让时选择同一方向导致尴尬互动），旨在理解这种隐式沟通机制，为设计安全可接受的机器人行为提供 insights。

Method: 采用强化学习（RL）方法，让RL智能体利用之前开发的Communication-Enabled Interaction (CEI)框架模型，学习如何与行人模型进行互动。

Result: 基础RL智能体成功学会了与CEI模型互动；具有风险感知能力的RL智能体能够通过运动有效传达意图，显著降低了感知风险，并减少了模拟行人的避让努力。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了利用CEI模型进行机器人规划决策的可行性，是一个有前景的研究方向，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: Pedestrians approaching each other on a sidewalk sometimes end up in an
awkward interaction known as the "sidewalk salsa": they both (repeatedly)
deviate to the same side to avoid a collision. This provides an interesting use
case to study interactions between pedestrians and mobile robots because, in
the vast majority of cases, this phenomenon is avoided through a negotiation
based on implicit communication. Understanding how it goes wrong and how
pedestrians end up in the sidewalk salsa will therefore provide insight into
the implicit communication. This understanding can be used to design safe and
acceptable robotic behaviour. In a previous attempt to gain this understanding,
a model of pedestrian behaviour based on the Communication-Enabled Interaction
(CEI) framework was developed that can replicate the sidewalk salsa. However,
it is unclear how to leverage this model in robotic planning and
decision-making since it violates the assumptions of game theory, a much-used
framework in planning and decision-making. Here, we present a proof-of-concept
for an approach where a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent leverages the model
to learn how to interact with pedestrians. The results show that a basic RL
agent successfully learned to interact with the CEI model. Furthermore, a
risk-averse RL agent that had access to the perceived risk of the CEI model
learned how to effectively communicate its intention through its motion and
thereby substantially lowered the perceived risk, and displayed effort by the
modelled pedestrian. These results show this is a promising approach and
encourage further exploration.

TL;DR: QuadKAN是一种基于样条参数化和KAN网络的视觉引导四足运动控制方法，通过结合本体感觉和视觉输入，实现了更鲁棒、高效和可解释的运动控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉引导四足运动控制中需要结合本体感觉和视觉信息来实现鲁棒控制的问题，传统方法在处理状态到动作映射的片段平滑特性时存在效率低下和动作抖动等问题。

Method: 提出QuadKAN框架，使用样条参数化的跨模态策略，包含样条编码器处理本体感觉输入和样条融合头处理本体感觉-视觉输入。采用多模态延迟随机化(MMDR)和近端策略优化(PPO)进行端到端训练。

Conclusion: 样条参数化策略为鲁棒的视觉引导运动控制提供了一种简单、有效且可解释的替代方案，能够提高样本效率、减少动作抖动和能耗，并提供可解释的姿态-动作敏感性。

Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning
(RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for
robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy
instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates
a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for
proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the
state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving
sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing
interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay
Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even
and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate
that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer
collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that
spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable
alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made
available upon acceptance.

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

Abstract: In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as
ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task
completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in
scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations,
limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability
for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has
emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating
domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing
some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only
limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require
intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In
this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG
systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to
Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as
the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses
generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we
discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a
pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance
of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.

Conclusion: LINKO框架通过整合多个本体系统和双轴知识传播，显著提升了医学概念表示学习的效果，特别是在数据稀缺和罕见疾病预测方面表现出色。

Abstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic
health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved
connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical
concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related
concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating
domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology
systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without
integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept
representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,
overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a
large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework
that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis
knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to
enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first
employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology
concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept
descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our
method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by
performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical
propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology
horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive
experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of
LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with
existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness
in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

Conclusion: TiG框架有效解决了LLM在交互环境中的决策问题，同时保持了透明度和可解释性，为结合LLM推理能力和RL交互学习提供了新途径

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive
tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a
critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and
procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through
environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require
substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge
and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static
knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this
challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers
LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game
environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory
abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a
language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are
refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on
environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully
bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving
competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands
compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step
natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency
and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available
on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is
intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added
over time.

Abstract: The focus of AI development has shifted from academic research to practical
applications. However, AI development faces numerous challenges at various
levels. This article will attempt to analyze the opportunities and challenges
of AI from several different perspectives using a structured approach. This
article proposes a seven-layer model for AI compute architecture, including
Physical Layer, Link Layer, Neural Network Layer, Context Layer, Agent Layer,
Orchestrator Layer, and Application Layer, from bottom to top. It also explains
how AI computing has evolved into this 7-layer architecture through the
three-stage evolution on large-scale language models (LLMs). For each layer, we
describe the development trajectory and key technologies. In Layers 1 and 2 we
discuss AI computing issues and the impact of Scale-Up and Scale-Out strategies
on computing architecture. In Layer 3 we explore two different development
paths for LLMs. In Layer 4 we discuss the impact of contextual memory on LLMs
and compares it to traditional processor memory. In Layers 5 to 7 we discuss
the trends of AI agents and explore the issues in evolution from a single AI
agent to an AI-based ecosystem, and their impact on the AI industry.
Furthermore, AI development involves not only technical challenges but also the
economic issues to build self-sustainable ecosystem. This article analyzes the
internet industry to provide predictions on the future trajectory of AI
development.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文从认知视角研究知识管理中的遗忘操作，提出了五种通用类型的认知遗忘，并在Spohn排序函数中实例化了七种具体遗忘操作，通过丰富的公理体系评估不同遗忘算子的特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的遗忘操作主要基于经典逻辑（变量消除和AGM收缩），但缺乏在更丰富语义结构的认知状态中的系统研究。本文旨在将遗忘操作提升到认知层面，探索在认知背景下的遗忘含义。

Method: 采用认知视角，在具有命题逻辑清晰链接的认知状态中研究遗忘操作。提出了五种通用类型的认知遗忘，并在Spohn排序函数中实例化了七种具体操作。借鉴逻辑编程和AGM理论中的遗忘公理，建立了丰富的公理体系进行评估。

Conclusion: 本文为认知状态中的遗忘操作提供了系统的理论框架，通过多维度评估揭示了不同遗忘算子的特征，为知识管理中的选择性遗忘提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: Forgetting as a knowledge management operation deliberately ignores parts of
the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, for various reasons. Forgetting has many
facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a
conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing
forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable
elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to
focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic
programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief
revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical
deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we
take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic
states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional
logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic
background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to
the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and
instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking
functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic
programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating
forgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations
according to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview
highlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.

### [123] [Learning Lifted Action Models From Traces of Incomplete Actions and States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21449)
*Niklas Jansen,Jonas Gösgens,Hector Geffner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从状态-动作轨迹中学习lifted STRIPS模型的新方法SYNTH，解决了在状态信息不完整（缺少某些谓词）和动作参数不完整（不显示所有涉及对象）的现实场景下的模型学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型学习方法大多假设状态包含所有STRIPS谓词或动作是完整的STRIPS动作，但在实际应用中，观察到的状态往往不完整，动作参数也不完全可见。本文旨在解决这种更现实的设置下的模型学习问题。

Method: 引入了STRIPS+变体，允许动作参数在前提条件中隐式存在并支持有限形式的存在量化。SYNTH算法为每个动作构建分层序列的前提条件表达式（"查询"），用于识别状态中的唯一对象并实例化STRIPS+中的隐式动作参数。

Result: SYNTH算法被证明具有正确性和完备性，并在从现有STRIPS域派生的STRIPS+模型生成的状态-动作轨迹上测试了其可扩展性。

Conclusion: 提出的STRIPS+框架和SYNTH算法能够有效处理状态信息不完整和动作参数不完全可见的现实模型学习场景，为从部分观察数据中学习动作模型提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Consider the problem of learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile
puzzle from random state-action traces where the states represent the location
of the tiles only, and the actions are the labels up, down, left, and right,
with no arguments. Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the
states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the
atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not
full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the
actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different
versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the
traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all
observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as
the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,
and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not
the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the
learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,
where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions
which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The
learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+
state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,
constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or
``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground
the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of
SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces
obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

*Xijia Tao,Yihua Teng,Xinxing Su,Xinyu Fu,Jihao Wu,Chaofan Tao,Ziru Liu,Haoli Bai,Rui Liu,Lingpeng Kong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMSearch-Plus是一个新的多模态搜索基准测试，包含311个需要深度视觉推理的任务，旨在解决现有基准测试中浅层工作流的问题，通过空间-时间外推方法构建任务，要求模型提取弱视觉信号并进行迭代搜索验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态浏览基准测试往往可以通过浅层的固定工作流解决，依赖于高召回率的图像搜索和邻近文本，掩盖了真正的多模态挑战，如细粒度视觉推理、来源验证和长时程工具使用。

Method: 采用空间-时间外推方法构建任务，每个任务包含多个弱局部视觉信号，需要通过迭代文本-图像搜索进行提取和传播，并在检索噪声下进行交叉验证。提供了模型无关的代理框架和浏览工具。

Result: 最强代理(o3)在没有搜索的情况下达到15.1%准确率，在框架下进行搜索后达到36.0%准确率；最强的开源模型(Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct)在没有搜索时为0.0%，经过20轮搜索后达到6.9%。

Conclusion: 该基准测试揭示了模型在来源验证、基于部件的推理和长时程规划方面的失败，强调了真正多模态理解的重要性，并为评估多模态网络代理提供了更严格的测试平台。

Abstract: Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web
agents, yet many multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed
workflows that lean on high-recall image search and nearby text-masking the
genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance
verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a
benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while
preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each
item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that
must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and
cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure,
Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require
extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts,
signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to
out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a
model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of
closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search
and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source
model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20
rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and
cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in
source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于Z数的模糊推理系统，用于计算智慧评分，同时考虑智慧的多维性和不确定性。该系统通过图形道德困境任务收集语言响应，并使用21条规则结合5个智慧组成成分，进行双属性智慧表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前智慧测量依赖自我报告，缺乏对谦虚和不确定性的考虑。需要一种计算框架来提升心理学测量，并为人性化AI提供支持，考虑智慧的多维性和信心度。

Method: 开发100名参与者，使用文化中立的图形道德困境任务，收集其说出内心想法的语言响应。将响应映射到5个智慧理论组成成分，使用基于21条规则的模糊推理系统，通过高斯核密度估计调整成员函数，产生包含智慧分数（限制）和信心分数（确定性）的Z数表征。

Result: 在概念验证研究中，系统产生的双属性智慧表征与现有量表呈现出轻度但显著的相关性，而与无关特质的关联微小，支持了聚合效度和区别效度。

Conclusion: 该研究将智慧形式化为一种多维度、考虑不确定性的构念，通过Z数进行操作化。除了推进心理学测量外，还计算了模糊Z数如何为AI系统提供可解释、敏感于信心度的推理能力，在严格计算与类人判断之间找到安全的中间地带。

Abstract: Background: Wisdom is a superordinate construct that embraces perspective
taking, reflectiveness, prosocial orientation, reflective empathetic action,
and intellectual humility. Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are
rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,
requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures
depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent
in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both
multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological
science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z
numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score
(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,
participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral
dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which
were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of
each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with
membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In
a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom
representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established
scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting
convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to
formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct,
operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing
measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI
systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe,
middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.

### [126] [Counterfactual Scenarios for Automated Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21521)
*Nicola Gigante,Francesco Leofante,Andrea Micheli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于反事实场景的新解释范式，用于解释自动化规划问题中的高级属性，而非仅仅关注规划的最小修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的反事实解释虽然能够帮助诊断故障和推理规划特征，但无法捐捕所解决问题的高级属性。需要一种能够描述问题本身变化的解释方法。

Method: 提出了两种定性的反事实场景实例化方法，通过明确量化必须满足特定属性的规划来识别对规划问题P的最小修改，以使其允许符合式ψ的规划。分析了不同类型变化允许时生成这种反事实场景的计算复杂度。

Result: 证明了生成反事实场景的计算复杂度通常只与为规划问题P计算规划的成本相当，说明了该方法的实际可行性。

Conclusion: 该研究为自动化规划领域提供了一个实用的反事实解释框架，能够有效地解释问题的高级属性，为该领域的算法开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are a powerful technique used to explain
Machine Learning models by showing how the input to a model should be minimally
changed for the model to produce a different output. Similar proposals have
been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been
characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would
result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may
help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail
to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on
counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an
\ltlf formula $\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual
scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that
comply with $\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of
counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that
must satisfy $\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of
generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are
allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only
as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical
viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct
practical algorithms in this area.

Motivation: 流程挖掘在医疗领域应用面临技术复杂、缺乏标准化方法和培训资源有限等障碍，需要简化工具来提高可访问性。

Method: 开发HealthProcessAI框架，集成Python(PM4PY)和R(bupaR)库，使用多个大型语言模型(LLM)进行自动化流程图解释和报告生成，通过OpenRouter平台比较5个先进LLM模型。

Result: 框架成功处理脓毒症数据的4个概念验证场景，Claude Sonnet-4和Gemini 2.5-Pro获得最高一致性评分(3.79/4.0和3.65/4.0)，展示了强大的技术性能和自动化LLM分析能力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合结构化分析和AI驱动的解释，为将复杂流程挖掘结果转化为医疗应用的可操作见解提供了新颖的方法学进展。

Abstract: Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for
understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces
significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized
approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce
HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining
applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive
wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address
unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and
report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that
diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis
progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five
state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its
functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four
proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its
capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation
using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model
strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency
scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By
integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation
and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with
process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data
scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven
interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in
translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights
for healthcare applications.

Method: 使用状态函数学习不依赖于具体对象的广义野标，构建导向广义野标图，包括识别循环可能性，并将其用于规划器的启发式搜索

Result: 从少量小型实例学习的广义野标图在同域的更大实例中也有效，当识别出重复循环时效果显著提升

Conclusion: 广义野标能够提取可解释的域信息，通过少量规划就可发现，对自动规划器有帮助

Abstract: We propose a new framework for discovering landmarks that automatically
generalize across a domain. These generalized landmarks are learned from a set
of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where
traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized
landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions
that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all
similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we
construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark
progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how
to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same
domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a
few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.
If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant
improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks
capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated
planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the
same domain.

Abstract: Many high-level multi-agent planning problems, including multi-robot
navigation and path planning, can be effectively modeled using deterministic
actions and observations.
  In this work, we focus on such domains and introduce the class of
Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs). This is a subclass of
Dec-POMDPs characterized by deterministic transitions and observations
conditioned on the state and joint actions.
  We then propose a practical solver called Iterative Deterministic POMDP
Planning (IDPP). This method builds on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for
Policies framework and is specifically optimized to handle large-scale
Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers are unable to address
efficiently.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network
optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive,
explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The
proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and
business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries,
contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The
core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a
network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a
mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,
RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,
configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates
how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing
costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating
private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural
networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time
decision-making.

Motivation: MHA*虽然利用多个不可采纳的启发式函数加速搜索，但原始版本是单次算法，无法随时间改进解质量，需要仔细设置膨胀因子

Result: 在3D路径规划和滑块拼图领域测试，A-MHA*相比MHA*和其他随时算法表现出色

Conclusion: A-MHA*成功将MHA*扩展为随时算法，保持了原有理论保证，同时提供了持续改进解质量的能力

Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain
knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and
correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the
search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby
affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search
using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in
Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible
heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original
version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm
that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time
solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime
version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually
improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime
Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*
concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and
completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.
Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain
and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

Abstract: Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect
requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases
shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be
inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble
Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that
orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather
than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that
suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential
strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician
verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large
language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both
consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty
and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated
clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can
enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI
imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new
regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical
AI systems.

*Jiho Choi,Seojeong Park,Seongjong Song,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PosterForest是一个无需训练的科学海报生成框架，通过分层中间表示和多智能体协作策略，实现文本和视觉元素的语义整合与层次结构保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了科学文档的层次结构和文本视觉元素的语义整合，需要一种能够同时解决这两个挑战的自动化海报生成方法。

Method: 提出Poster Tree分层中间表示来编码文档结构和视觉-文本关系，采用多智能体协作策略（内容摘要和布局规划智能体）进行迭代协调和相互反馈。

Result: 在多个学术领域的实验表明，该方法在定性和定量评估上均优于现有基线，生成的海报质量最接近专家设计，在信息保存、结构清晰度和用户偏好方面表现优异。

Conclusion: PosterForest框架通过分层表示和多智能体协作，成功实现了科学海报的自动化高质量生成，解决了现有方法在结构和语义整合方面的不足。

Abstract: We present a novel training-free framework, \textit{PosterForest}, for
automated scientific poster generation. Unlike prior approaches, which largely
neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic
integration of textual and visual elements, our method addresses both
challenges directly. We introduce the \textit{Poster Tree}, a hierarchical
intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and
visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. Our framework employs a
multi-agent collaboration strategy, where agents specializing in content
summarization and layout planning iteratively coordinate and provide mutual
feedback. This approach enables the joint optimization of logical consistency,
content fidelity, and visual coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
academic domains show that our method outperforms existing baselines in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The resulting posters achieve quality
closest to expert-designed ground truth and deliver superior information
preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

### [134] [Tree-Guided Diffusion Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21800)
*Hyeonseong Jeon,Cheolhong Min,Jaesik Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Tree-guided Diffusion Planner (TDP)，一种零样本测试时规划框架，通过树搜索和双层采样过程解决非凸、不可微和多奖励场景下的规划问题，无需任务特定训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准梯度引导在非凸目标、不可微约束和多奖励结构的现实场景中效果有限，且现有监督规划方法需要任务特定训练，限制了测试时灵活性和零样本泛化能力。

Method: 将测试时规划构建为树搜索问题，采用双层采样：1) 通过无训练粒子引导生成多样化父轨迹进行探索；2) 通过任务目标引导的快速条件去噪精炼子轨迹。

Result: 在迷宫金币收集、机器人手臂块操作和AntMaze多目标探索三个任务上，TDP始终优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: TDP通过探索多样化轨迹区域并利用扩展解空间中的梯度信息，仅使用预训练模型和测试时奖励信号，有效解决了梯度引导的局限性。

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach
for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient
guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward
landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios
involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and
multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches
require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time
flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion
Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances
exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame
test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:
(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle
guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined
through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the
limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and
harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only
pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three
diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze
multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on all tasks. The project page can be found at:

### [135] [Freeze and Conquer: Reusable Ansatz for Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21730)
*Fabrizio Fagiolo,Nicolo' Vescera*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种变分算法解决旅行商问题，采用紧凑排列编码减少量子比特需求，并通过优化-冻结-重用策略实现高效求解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对旅行商问题，旨在开发一种在NISQ硬件上可立即实现的量子算法，减少计算成本并提高求解效率。

Method: 结合紧凑排列编码和优化-冻结-重用策略：首先通过模拟退火优化训练实例的电路拓扑，然后冻结结构并在新实例上仅重新优化电路参数。

Result: 在4-7个城市的随机对称实例上，4城市达到100%最优路径采样概率，5城市90%，6城市80%，7城市降至约20%，显示方法的可扩展性限制。

Conclusion: 该方法在中等问题规模上表现出强大的泛化能力，冻结Ansatz能显著减少求解时间而不降低解质量，但存在可扩展性限制，有望扩展到更复杂问题。

Abstract: In this paper we present a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which
reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy:
where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training
instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel
instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters.
This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the
procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.
  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$
cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling
probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for
6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of
$\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed
method.
  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and
indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution
without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability
limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and
prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and
Job-Shop Scheduling.

TL;DR: 本文提出了在给定摘要因果图背景知识下，保证时间变量间微观层面边可定向性的条件，为复杂时序系统中的因果发现提供理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分析中理解时间变量间的因果关系是一个核心挑战，特别是当完整的因果结构未知时。专家通常能够提供捕获主要因果关系的摘要因果图，但如何利用这种高层抽象来指导微观层面的因果发现需要理论支持。

Method: 提出了在给定摘要因果图背景知识、假设存在忠实且因果充分的分布的情况下，保证时间变量间微观层面边可定向性的条件。这些条件即使在宏观层面存在循环或双向边的情况下也适用。

Result: 研究结果为微观层面的边定向提供了理论保证，即使在宏观层面存在循环或双向边的情况下也能工作。

Conclusion: 这些发现为利用摘要因果图来指导复杂时序系统中的因果发现提供了实用指导，强调了将专家知识融入观测时间序列数据因果推理中的价值。

Abstract: Understanding causal relations between temporal variables is a central
challenge in time series analysis, particularly when the full causal structure
is unknown. Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified,
experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal
graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal
relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level
details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability
of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge
encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and
causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our
results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level,
even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These
findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal
discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating
expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series
data.

*Yeawon Lee,Xiaoyang Wang,Christopher C. Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种协作式多代理系统，模拟临床会诊团队进行临床问题识别，在SOAP备忙记录的S和O部分进行诊断推理，显著提升了临床问题识别的准确性和稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床记录的复杂性使得自动化解释面临挑战，单一模型方法缺乏高风险临床任务所需的稳健性。需要更准确、可靠的临床决策支持工具。

Method: 设计了一个协作式多代理系统，由管理代理组织动态分配的专科代理团队。系统进行层次化、迭代性辩论，通过模拟临床团队的诊断推理过程，将原始数据合成为评估。

Result: 在420份MIMIC-III记录的精选数据集上评估，动态多代理配置在识别心力衰竭、急性肾伤杂和感染性伏克等疾病时显示出持续改进的性能。质性分析显示这种结构能有效地揭示和衡量冲突证据。

Conclusion: 通过模拟临床团队的推理过程，该系统为开发更准确、稳健和可解释的临床决策支持工具提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care,
but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the
robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a
collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team
to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by
analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes,
simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an
assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of
specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a
consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated
dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration
demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart
failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent
debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting
evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling
a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward
more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需骨架注册的数据驱动框架，用于处理未注册表面网格的运动预测和迁移，通过运动嵌入网络和顶点特征场生成时空变形场


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未注册表面网格（特别是原始3D扫描）由于缺乏点对点对应关系和存在数据噪声，在自动计算合理变形方面面临重大挑战

Method: 结合鲁棒的运动嵌入网络和学习的逐顶点特征场，生成时空变形场来驱动网格变形

Result: 在行走、跑步等任务上的定量基准测试和定性可视化评估表明，该方法在具有挑战性的未注册网格上具有有效性和通用性

Conclusion: 该方法为处理未注册网格提供了一种有效的rig-free解决方案，能够处理噪声数据并生成合理的变形

Abstract: Unregistered surface meshes, especially raw 3D scans, present significant
challenges for automatic computation of plausible deformations due to the lack
of established point-wise correspondences and the presence of noise in the
data. In this paper, we propose a new, rig-free, data-driven framework for
motion prediction and transfer on such body meshes. Our method couples a robust
motion embedding network with a learned per-vertex feature field to generate a
spatio-temporal deformation field, which drives the mesh deformation. Extensive
evaluations, including quantitative benchmarks and qualitative visuals on tasks
such as walking and running, demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of
our approach on challenging unregistered meshes.

Result: 提出的两种正则化策略有效改善了单个高斯基元的保真度和整体表面行为的一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从3DGS数据生成更准确和一致的视觉效果，提升了3D网格重建的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes and visuals from 3D Gaussian
Splatting(3DGS) still remains a central challenge in computer graphics.
Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering,
there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene
consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary
regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of
individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first
strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent
studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages
extreme anisotropy-specifically, "needle-like" shapes-by favoring more
balanced, "disk-like" forms that are better suited for stable surface
reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance
Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an
Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous
global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the
underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity
of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The
final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.
