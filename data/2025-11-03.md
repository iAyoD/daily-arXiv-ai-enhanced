*Conor K. Trygstad,Nestor O. Perez-Arancibia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该研究对两种新型昆虫尺度推进器进行了力特性表征，包括单尾和双尾设计，测量了其最大推力和周期平均推力值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 采用基于反作用力概念的理论框架，并使用定制微牛级力传感器获取实验数据进行表征。

Result: 单尾推进器的最大推力和周期平均推力分别为0.45 mN和2.97 μN；双尾推进器分别为0.61 mN和22.6 μN。

Abstract: We present force characterizations of two newly developed insect-scale
propulsors--one single-tailed and one double-tailed--for microrobotic swimmers
that leverage fluid-structure interaction (FSI) to generate thrust. The designs
of these two devices were inspired by anguilliform swimming and are driven by
soft tails excited by high-work-density (HWD) actuators powered by shape-memory
alloy (SMA) wires. While these propulsors have been demonstrated to be suitable
for microrobotic aquatic locomotion and controllable with simple architectures
for trajectory tracking in the two-dimensional (2D) space, the characteristics
and magnitudes of the associated forces have not been studied systematically.
In the research presented here, we adopted a theoretical framework based on the
notion of reactive forces and obtained experimental data for characterization
using a custom-built micro-N-resolution force sensor. We measured maximum and
cycle-averaged force values with multi-test means of respectively 0.45 mN and
2.97 micro-N, for the tested single-tail propulsor. For the dual-tail
propulsor, we measured maximum and cycle-averaged force values with multi-test
means of 0.61 mN and 22.6 micro-N, respectively. These results represent the
first measurements of the instantaneous thrust generated by insect-scale
propulsors of this type and provide insights into FSI for efficient
microrobotic propulsion.

### [3] [Design for One, Deploy for Many: Navigating Tree Mazes with Multiple Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26900)
*Jahir Argote-Gerald,Genki Miyauchi,Julian Rau,Paul Trodden,Roderich Gross*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种分布式多智能体迷宫遍历算法，使用领导者切换机制，在无环图表示的迷宫环境中实现高效协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决洞穴和管道网络等迷宫环境中多机器人协调的挑战，包括通信限制和拥堵问题。

Method: 采用领导者切换机制，一个智能体担任头角色使用单智能体迷宫求解器，其他智能体跟随选择的智能体，在必要时将头角色转移给相邻智能体。

Result: 在最多300个智能体的模拟中，算法在makespan方面优于naïve和全局通信策略，在sum-of-fuel方面优于naïve但劣于全局通信策略，与全知识策略渐近等价。

Conclusion: 该算法在迷宫环境中有效协调多智能体，实际实验验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Maze-like environments, such as cave and pipe networks, pose unique
challenges for multiple robots to coordinate, including communication
constraints and congestion. To address these challenges, we propose a
distributed multi-agent maze traversal algorithm for environments that can be
represented by acyclic graphs. It uses a leader-switching mechanism where one
agent, assuming a head role, employs any single-agent maze solver while the
other agents each choose an agent to follow. The head role gets transferred to
neighboring agents where necessary, ensuring it follows the same path as a
single agent would. The multi-agent maze traversal algorithm is evaluated in
simulations with groups of up to 300 agents, various maze sizes, and multiple
single-agent maze solvers. It is compared against strategies that are na\"ive,
or assume either global communication or full knowledge of the environment. The
algorithm outperforms the na\"ive strategy in terms of makespan and
sum-of-fuel. It is superior to the global-communication strategy in terms of
makespan but is inferior to it in terms of sum-of-fuel. The findings suggest it
is asymptotically equivalent to the full-knowledge strategy with respect to
either metric. Moreover, real-world experiments with up to 20 Pi-puck robots
confirm the feasibility of the approach.

### [4] [NaviTrace: Evaluating Embodied Navigation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26909)
*Tim Windecker,Manthan Patel,Moritz Reuss,Richard Schwarzkopf,Cesar Cadena,Rudolf Lioutikov,Marco Hutter,Jonas Frey*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了NaviTrace基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在机器人导航中的能力，包含1000个场景和3000多个专家轨迹，通过语义感知轨迹评分系统评估了8个最先进的VLM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估视觉语言模型导航能力的方法受到真实世界试验成本高、模拟过于简化、基准测试有限的约束，需要一种可扩展且可复现的评估方法。

Method: 引入NaviTrace基准测试，模型接收指令和体现类型（人类、腿式机器人、轮式机器人、自行车），输出图像空间中的2D导航轨迹，使用结合动态时间规整距离、目标端点误差和基于每像素语义的体现条件惩罚的语义感知轨迹评分。

Result: 评估揭示了与人类性能之间存在一致差距，主要由于空间基础和目标定位能力不足，该评分与人类偏好相关。

Conclusion: NaviTrace为真实世界机器人导航建立了可扩展且可复现的基准测试。

Abstract: Vision-language models demonstrate unprecedented performance and
generalization across a wide range of tasks and scenarios. Integrating these
foundation models into robotic navigation systems opens pathways toward
building general-purpose robots. Yet, evaluating these models' navigation
capabilities remains constrained by costly real-world trials, overly simplified
simulations, and limited benchmarks. We introduce NaviTrace, a high-quality
Visual Question Answering benchmark where a model receives an instruction and
embodiment type (human, legged robot, wheeled robot, bicycle) and must output a
2D navigation trace in image space. Across 1000 scenarios and more than 3000
expert traces, we systematically evaluate eight state-of-the-art VLMs using a
newly introduced semantic-aware trace score. This metric combines Dynamic Time
Warping distance, goal endpoint error, and embodiment-conditioned penalties
derived from per-pixel semantics and correlates with human preferences. Our
evaluation reveals consistent gap to human performance caused by poor spatial
grounding and goal localization. NaviTrace establishes a scalable and
reproducible benchmark for real-world robotic navigation. The benchmark and
leaderboard can be found at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPINE-HT是一个用于异构机器人团队的框架，通过三阶段过程将大型语言模型的推理能力与机器人能力相结合，在非结构化环境中实现自然语言任务规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构机器人团队在非结构化环境中执行复杂任务时，需要适应在线获取的信息并进行协作。现有基于LLM的团队方法通常假设环境结构良好且已知，限制了在非结构化环境中的部署。

Method: 采用三阶段过程：1) LLM根据任务目标和团队能力生成接地的子任务并进行可行性验证；2) 基于机器人能力（如移动性或感知能力）分配子任务；3) 根据在线操作期间收集的反馈精炼子任务。

Result: 在具有闭环感知和控制的仿真实验中，该框架的成功率比先前基于LLM的异构团队方法提高了近一倍。在真实世界实验中，使用多种机器人平台实现了87%的成功率。

Conclusion: SPINE-HT框架通过将LLM的推理能力与机器人能力相结合，显著提高了异构机器人团队在非结构化环境中执行复杂任务的成功率。

Abstract: Heterogeneous robot teams operating in realistic settings often must
accomplish complex missions requiring collaboration and adaptation to
information acquired online. Because robot teams frequently operate in
unstructured environments -- uncertain, open-world settings without prior maps
-- subtasks must be grounded in robot capabilities and the physical world.
While heterogeneous teams have typically been designed for fixed
specifications, generative intelligence opens the possibility of teams that can
accomplish a wide range of missions described in natural language. However,
current large language model (LLM)-enabled teaming methods typically assume
well-structured and known environments, limiting deployment in unstructured
environments. We present SPINE-HT, a framework that addresses these limitations
by grounding the reasoning abilities of LLMs in the context of a heterogeneous
robot team through a three-stage process. Given language specifications
describing mission goals and team capabilities, an LLM generates grounded
subtasks which are validated for feasibility. Subtasks are then assigned to
robots based on capabilities such as traversability or perception and refined
given feedback collected during online operation. In simulation experiments
with closed-loop perception and control, our framework achieves nearly twice
the success rate compared to prior LLM-enabled heterogeneous teaming
approaches. In real-world experiments with a Clearpath Jackal, a Clearpath
Husky, a Boston Dynamics Spot, and a high-altitude UAV, our method achieves an
87\% success rate in missions requiring reasoning about robot capabilities and
refining subtasks with online feedback. More information is provided at

### [6] [RepV: Safety-Separable Latent Spaces for Scalable Neurosymbolic Plan Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26935)
*Yunhao Yang,Neel P. Bhatt,Pranay Samineni,Rohan Siva,Zhanyang Wang,Ufuk Topcu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RepV是一个神经符号验证器，通过学习安全与不安全计划的线性可分潜在空间，实现对自然语言规则的合规性验证，并提供概率保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AI系统应用于安全关键领域时，需要验证其行为是否符合明确定义的规则。现有方法存在局限性：形式化方法需要手工制作时序逻辑规范，表达能力有限；深度学习方法虽然能评估自然语言约束，但决策过程不透明可能导致严重误判。

Method: RepV结合神经符号方法，从少量模型检查器标记的计划开始，训练轻量级投影器将每个计划与语言模型生成的原理嵌入低维空间，使用冻结线性边界对未见自然语言规则进行一次性前向传播验证。

Result: 实验评估显示，RepV相比基线方法将合规性预测准确率提高了15%，同时仅增加不到0.2M参数。其精炼框架在各种规划领域均优于普通微调基线。

Conclusion: 安全可分离的潜在空间为可靠的神经符号计划验证提供了可扩展、即插即用的原语。

Abstract: As AI systems migrate to safety-critical domains, verifying that their
actions comply with well-defined rules remains a challenge. Formal methods
provide provable guarantees but demand hand-crafted temporal-logic
specifications, offering limited expressiveness and accessibility. Deep
learning approaches enable evaluation of plans against natural-language
constraints, yet their opaque decision process invites misclassifications with
potentially severe consequences. We introduce RepV, a neurosymbolic verifier
that unifies both views by learning a latent space where safe and unsafe plans
are linearly separable. Starting from a modest seed set of plans labeled by an
off-the-shelf model checker, RepV trains a lightweight projector that embeds
each plan, together with a language model-generated rationale, into a
low-dimensional space; a frozen linear boundary then verifies compliance for
unseen natural-language rules in a single forward pass.
  Beyond binary classification, RepV provides a probabilistic guarantee on the
likelihood of correct verification based on its position in the latent space.
This guarantee enables a guarantee-driven refinement of the planner, improving
rule compliance without human annotations. Empirical evaluations show that RepV
improves compliance prediction accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline
methods while adding fewer than 0.2M parameters. Furthermore, our refinement
framework outperforms ordinary fine-tuning baselines across various planning
domains. These results show that safety-separable latent spaces offer a
scalable, plug-and-play primitive for reliable neurosymbolic plan verification.

### [7] [A Hermetic, Transparent Soft Growing Vine Robot System for Pipe Inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27010)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软体藤蔓机器人在管道检查中面临子系统复杂和缺乏真实工业环境验证的限制，需要开发更稳健、简化的系统。

Method: 设计了密封透明的藤蔓机器人系统，开发了被动适应的封闭式尖端安装座来运输传感器，并在废水管道中进行实地验证。

Result: 成功验证了密封透明藤蔓机器人系统在真实废水管道中进行状态评估和测绘的能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了软体藤蔓机器人在管道检查中的应用，开发并展示了一个适合持续开发和部署的稳健、简化的现场验证系统。

Abstract: Rehabilitation of aging pipes requires accurate condition assessment and
mapping far into the pipe interiors. Soft growing vine robot systems are
particularly promising for navigating confined, sinuous paths such as in pipes,
but are currently limited by complex subsystems and a lack of validation in
real-world industrial settings. In this paper, we introduce the concept and
implementation of a hermetic and transparent vine robot system for visual
condition assessment and mapping within non-branching pipes. This design
encloses all mechanical and electrical components within the vine robot's soft,
airtight, and transparent body, protecting them from environmental interference
while enabling visual sensing. Because this approach requires an enclosed
mechanism for transporting sensors, we developed, modeled, and tested a
passively adapting enclosed tip mount. Finally, we validated the hermetic and
transparent vine robot system concept through a real-world condition assessment
and mapping task in a wastewater pipe. This work advances the use of
soft-growing vine robots in pipe inspection by developing and demonstrating a
robust, streamlined, field-validated system suitable for continued development
and deployment.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合全景图像和3D点云的神经符号框架，通过显式建模空间和逻辑关系来改进视觉空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在感知任务上表现出色，但在细粒度空间推理方面存在困难，特别是在机器人领域需要理解复杂环境中物体关系的场景。

Method: 构建包含感知模块和推理模块的神经符号框架，感知模块检测实体并提取属性，推理模块构建结构化场景图来支持精确、可解释的查询。

Result: 在JRDB-Reasoning数据集上的评估显示，该方法在拥挤的人造环境中表现出优越的性能和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持轻量级设计的同时，为机器人和具身AI应用提供了有效的空间推理解决方案。

Abstract: Visual reasoning, particularly spatial reasoning, is a challenging cognitive
task that requires understanding object relationships and their interactions
within complex environments, especially in robotics domain. Existing
vision_language models (VLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with
fine-grained spatial reasoning due to their implicit, correlation-driven
reasoning and reliance solely on images. We propose a novel neuro_symbolic
framework that integrates both panoramic-image and 3D point cloud information,
combining neural perception with symbolic reasoning to explicitly model spatial
and logical relationships. Our framework consists of a perception module for
detecting entities and extracting attributes, and a reasoning module that
constructs a structured scene graph to support precise, interpretable queries.
Evaluated on the JRDB-Reasoning dataset, our approach demonstrates superior
performance and reliability in crowded, human_built environments while
maintaining a lightweight design suitable for robotics and embodied AI
applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SpikeATac是一种结合PVDF动态响应和电容式静态传感的多模态触觉手指，能够实现快速灵敏的接触检测，并通过学习框架在灵巧机械手上完成对易碎物体的精细操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够同时感知动态和静态触觉信息的多模态触觉传感器，以实现对易碎物体的精细抓取和灵巧操作。

Method: 结合16个税元的PVDF薄膜（4kHz采样）和电容式传感，使用基于学习的框架结合人类反馈强化学习和触觉奖励来微调策略。

Conclusion: SpikeATac硬件平台和学习管道共同实现了对易碎物体的精细灵巧操作，为机器人触觉传感和操作提供了新的能力。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce SpikeATac, a multimodal tactile finger combining a
taxelized and highly sensitive dynamic response (PVDF) with a static
transduction method (capacitive) for multimodal touch sensing. Named for its
`spiky' response, SpikeATac's 16-taxel PVDF film sampled at 4 kHz provides
fast, sensitive dynamic signals to the very onset and breaking of contact. We
characterize the sensitivity of the different modalities, and show that
SpikeATac provides the ability to stop quickly and delicately when grasping
fragile, deformable objects. Beyond parallel grasping, we show that SpikeATac
can be used in a learning-based framework to achieve new capabilities on a
dexterous multifingered robot hand. We use a learning recipe that combines
reinforcement learning from human feedback with tactile-based rewards to
fine-tune the behavior of a policy to modulate force. Our hardware platform and
learning pipeline together enable a difficult dexterous and contact-rich task
that has not previously been achieved: in-hand manipulation of fragile objects.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出DAP方法，将动力学预测整合到策略学习中，通过策略和动力学模型的相互校正反馈实现动作生成的自校正和泛化能力提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为克隆方法由于数据支持有限而泛化能力差，现有视频预测模型学习动作无关的动力学，无法区分不同控制输入，限制了在精确操作任务中的实用性。

Method: 设计新颖架构，策略和动力学模型在动作生成过程中提供相互校正反馈，实现自校正能力。

Result: 在真实世界机器人操作任务上展现出优于基线方法的泛化性能，在包括视觉干扰和光照变化的OOD场景中表现出特别的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DAP方法通过整合动力学预测与策略学习，有效提升了机器人学习的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Behavior cloning methods for robot learning suffer from poor generalization
due to limited data support beyond expert demonstrations. Recent approaches
leveraging video prediction models have shown promising results by learning
rich spatiotemporal representations from large-scale datasets. However, these
models learn action-agnostic dynamics that cannot distinguish between different
control inputs, limiting their utility for precise manipulation tasks and
requiring large pretraining datasets. We propose a Dynamics-Aligned Flow
Matching Policy (DAP) that integrates dynamics prediction into policy learning.
Our method introduces a novel architecture where policy and dynamics models
provide mutual corrective feedback during action generation, enabling
self-correction and improved generalization. Empirical validation demonstrates
generalization performance superior to baseline methods on real-world robotic
manipulation tasks, showing particular robustness in OOD scenarios including
visual distractions and lighting variations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水下机器人在受限和杂乱空间中的定位挑战，现有系统在工业环境中因覆盖范围差、依赖外部基础设施和需要特征丰富环境而表现不佳。

Method: 采用协作机器人和传感器融合方法，水面车辆作为移动领导者协助水下机器人定位，结合移动机器人感知和领导者-跟随者控制技术。

Conclusion: CAP系统通过移动机器人感知和领导者-跟随者控制的进步，实现了准确、实用且无需基础设施的水下定位技术突破。

Abstract: Positioning of underwater robots in confined and cluttered spaces remains a
key challenge for field operations. Existing systems are mostly designed for
large, open-water environments and struggle in industrial settings due to poor
coverage, reliance on external infrastructure, and the need for feature-rich
surroundings. Multipath effects from continuous sound reflections further
degrade signal quality, reducing accuracy and reliability. Accurate and easily
deployable positioning is essential for repeatable autonomous missions;
however, this requirement has created a technological bottleneck limiting
underwater robotic deployment. This paper presents the Collaborative Aquatic
Positioning (CAP) system, which integrates collaborative robotics and sensor
fusion to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the "mother-ship" concept,
the surface vehicle acts as a mobile leader to assist in positioning a
submerged robot, enabling localization even in GPS-denied and highly
constrained environments. The system is validated in a large test tank through
repeatable autonomous missions using CAP's position estimates for real-time
trajectory control. Experimental results demonstrate a mean Euclidean distance
(MED) error of 70 mm, achieved in real time without requiring fixed
infrastructure, extensive calibration, or environmental features. CAP leverages
advances in mobile robot sensing and leader-follower control to deliver a step
change in accurate, practical, and infrastructure-free underwater localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多机器人系统（特别是移动机械臂）在协作中的控制协调和动态稳定性挑战。

Method: 采用基于计算机视觉和AprilTag标记的自主对接策略，以及新型螺纹螺旋锁定机制。

Result: 对接配置在动态稳定性和操作效率方面表现更优：RMS加速度和急动度值更低，角度精度更高，任务完成时间显著缩短。

Conclusion: 物理重构是一个强大的设计原则，能够简化协作控制，提高现实环境中复杂任务的稳定性和性能。

Abstract: Multi-robot systems, particularly mobile manipulators, face challenges in
control coordination and dynamic stability when working together. To address
this issue, this study proposes MobiDock, a modular self-reconfigurable mobile
manipulator system that allows two independent robots to physically connect and
form a unified mobile bimanual platform. This process helps transform a complex
multi-robot control problem into the management of a simpler, single system.
The system utilizes an autonomous docking strategy based on computer vision
with AprilTag markers and a new threaded screw-lock mechanism. Experimental
results show that the docked configuration demonstrates better performance in
dynamic stability and operational efficiency compared to two independently
cooperating robots. Specifically, the unified system has lower Root Mean Square
(RMS) Acceleration and Jerk values, higher angular precision, and completes
tasks significantly faster. These findings confirm that physical
reconfiguration is a powerful design principle that simplifies cooperative
control, improving stability and performance for complex tasks in real-world
environments.

Motivation: 传统夹爪依赖高法向力抓取物体，容易损坏重物、易滑物体和易碎物品，需要一种更安全的抓取方案。

Method: 设计混合夹爪手指，包含刚性结构外壳和柔软可充气的硅胶袋，通过调节内部气压来主动控制表面摩擦系数。

Conclusion: 具有可调摩擦力的混合夹爪手指为依赖高法向力的传统方法提供了更鲁棒和安全的替代方案，增强了夹爪处理各类物体的灵活性。

Abstract: Grasping objects with diverse mechanical properties, such as heavy, slippery,
or fragile items, remains a significant challenge in robotics. Conventional
grippers often rely on applying high normal forces, which can cause damage to
objects. To address this limitation, we present a hybrid gripper finger that
combines a rigid structural shell with a soft, inflatable silicone pocket. The
gripper finger can actively modulate its surface friction by controlling the
internal air pressure of the silicone pocket. Results from fundamental
experiments indicate that increasing the internal pressure results in a
proportional increase in the effective coefficient of friction. This enables
the gripper to stably lift heavy and slippery objects without increasing the
gripping force and to handle fragile or deformable objects, such as eggs,
fruits, and paper cups, with minimal damage by increasing friction rather than
applying excessive force. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid
gripper finger with adaptable friction provides a robust and safer alternative
to relying solely on high normal forces, thereby enhancing the gripper
flexibility in handling delicate, fragile, and diverse objects.

Conclusion: VOPP通过向量化方法成功解决了POMDP并行化的瓶颈问题，实现了高效的并行求解

Abstract: Planning under partial observability is an essential capability of autonomous
robots. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) provides a
powerful framework for planning under partial observability problems, capturing
the stochastic effects of actions and the limited information available through
noisy observations. POMDP solving could benefit tremendously from massive
parallelization of today's hardware, but parallelizing POMDP solvers has been
challenging. They rely on interleaving numerical optimization over actions with
the estimation of their values, which creates dependencies and synchronization
bottlenecks between parallel processes that can quickly offset the benefits of
parallelization. In this paper, we propose Vectorized Online POMDP Planner
(VOPP), a novel parallel online solver that leverages a recent POMDP
formulation that analytically solves part of the optimization component,
leaving only the estimation of expectations for numerical computation. VOPP
represents all data structures related to planning as a collection of tensors
and implements all planning steps as fully vectorized computations over this
representation. The result is a massively parallel solver with no dependencies
and synchronization bottlenecks between parallel computations. Experimental
results indicate that VOPP is at least 20X more efficient in computing
near-optimal solutions compared to an existing state-of-the-art parallel online
solver.

Abstract: In this paper a modular and scalable architecture for heterogeneous
swarm-based Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UASs) built on PX4-Autopilot and
Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) framework is presented. The proposed
architecture emphasizes seamless integration of hardware components by
introducing independent ROS 2 nodes for each component of a Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV). Communication between swarm participants is abstracted in
software, allowing the use of various technologies without architectural
changes. Key functionalities are supported, e.g. leader following and formation
flight to maneuver the swarm. The system also allows computer vision algorithms
to be integrated for the detection and tracking of UAVs. Additionally, a ground
station control is integrated for the coordination of swarm operations.
Swarm-based Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) architecture is verified within a
Gazebo simulation environment but also in real-world demonstrations.

Conclusion: MEI是评估城市冲突和增强自动驾驶安全评估框架的有前景指标，开源实现已提供。

Abstract: Effective, reliable, and efficient evaluation of autonomous driving safety is
essential to demonstrate its trustworthiness. Criticality metrics provide an
objective means of assessing safety. However, as existing metrics primarily
target longitudinal conflicts, accurately quantifying the risks of lateral
conflicts - prevalent in urban settings - remains challenging. This paper
proposes the Modified-Emergency Index (MEI), a metric designed to quantify
evasive effort in lateral conflicts. Compared to the original Emergency Index
(EI), MEI refines the estimation of the time available for evasive maneuvers,
enabling more precise risk quantification. We validate MEI on a public lateral
conflict dataset based on Argoverse-2, from which we extract over 1,500
high-quality AV conflict cases, including more than 500 critical events. MEI is
then compared with the well-established ACT and the widely used PET metrics.
Results show that MEI consistently outperforms them in accurately quantifying
criticality and capturing risk evolution. Overall, these findings highlight MEI
as a promising metric for evaluating urban conflicts and enhancing the safety
assessment framework for autonomous driving. The open-source implementation is
available at https://github.com/AutoChengh/MEI.

Abstract: Multi-embodiment grasping focuses on developing approaches that exhibit
generalist behavior across diverse gripper designs. Existing methods often
learn the kinematic structure of the robot implicitly and face challenges due
to the difficulty of sourcing the required large-scale data. In this work, we
present a data-efficient, flow-based, equivariant grasp synthesis architecture
that can handle different gripper types with variable degrees of freedom and
successfully exploit the underlying kinematic model, deducing all necessary
information solely from the gripper and scene geometry. Unlike previous
equivariant grasping methods, we translated all modules from the ground up to
JAX and provide a model with batching capabilities over scenes, grippers, and
grasps, resulting in smoother learning, improved performance and faster
inference time. Our dataset encompasses grippers ranging from humanoid hands to
parallel yaw grippers and includes 25,000 scenes and 20 million grasps.

Result: 与随机探索和任务特定模型强化学习相比，SoftAE产生了更准确的动力学模型，在未见任务上实现了更好的零样本控制性能，并在传感噪声、驱动延迟和非线性材料效应下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 不确定性驱动的主动探索可以在多样化的软体机器人形态中产生可扩展、可重用的动力学模型，朝着更自主、适应性更强和数据效率更高的柔顺机器人控制迈出了一步。

Abstract: Soft robots offer unmatched adaptability and safety in unstructured
environments, yet their compliant, high-dimensional, and nonlinear dynamics
make modeling for control notoriously difficult. Existing data-driven
approaches often fail to generalize, constrained by narrowly focused task
demonstrations or inefficient random exploration. We introduce SoftAE, an
uncertainty-aware active exploration framework that autonomously learns
task-agnostic and generalizable dynamics models of soft robotic systems. SoftAE
employs probabilistic ensemble models to estimate epistemic uncertainty and
actively guides exploration toward underrepresented regions of the state-action
space, achieving efficient coverage of diverse behaviors without task-specific
supervision. We evaluate SoftAE on three simulated soft robotic platforms -- a
continuum arm, an articulated fish in fluid, and a musculoskeletal leg with
hybrid actuation -- and on a pneumatically actuated continuum soft arm in the
real world. Compared with random exploration and task-specific model-based
reinforcement learning, SoftAE produces more accurate dynamics models, enables
superior zero-shot control on unseen tasks, and maintains robustness under
sensing noise, actuation delays, and nonlinear material effects. These results
demonstrate that uncertainty-driven active exploration can yield scalable,
reusable dynamics models across diverse soft robotic morphologies, representing
a step toward more autonomous, adaptable, and data-efficient control in
compliant robots.

TL;DR: 该论文设计了一个机器人拒绝内部状态和相应回避行为，当人接近时机器人会撤退或推开。模型基于人际距离的不适累积和衰减，实现容忍和极限超出的回避行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人类-机器人交互中，物理接近或接触很常见。人类会根据关系和情境灵活接受、拒绝或容忍这种接近，因此需要设计机器人能够表达拒绝的内部状态和回避行为。

Method: 基于人际距离函数建模不适感的累积和衰减，使用PAD情感模型的支配轴实现容忍（忍耐）和极限超出的回避行为。在手臂机器人上实现不同强度的行为和动作。

Result: 展示了从内部状态参数到分级忍耐动作，再到极限被突破时的回避动作的连贯流程。

Conclusion: 成功实现了机器人基于内部状态的拒绝和回避行为，为人类-机器人交互中的物理接近提供了更自然的响应机制。

Abstract: Human-robot interaction frequently involves physical proximity or contact. In
human-human settings, people flexibly accept, reject, or tolerate such
approaches depending on the relationship and context. We explore the design of
a robot's rejective internal state and corresponding avoidance behaviors, such
as withdrawing or pushing away, when a person approaches. We model the
accumulation and decay of discomfort as a function of interpersonal distance,
and implement tolerance (endurance) and limit-exceeding avoidance driven by the
Dominance axis of the PAD affect model. The behaviors and their intensities are
realized on an arm robot. Results illustrate a coherent pipeline from internal
state parameters to graded endurance motions and, once a limit is crossed, to
avoidance actions.

TL;DR: 提出了EBT-Policy，一种基于能量的架构，解决了机器人策略学习中的核心问题，在计算效率、鲁棒性和推理稳定性方面优于扩散策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的隐式策略（如扩散策略）存在高计算成本、暴露偏差和不稳定推理动态等问题，而基于能量的模型（EBMs）虽然能解决这些问题但难以有效扩展。

Method: 开发了EBT-Policy架构，利用基于能量的变换器（EBTs）的可扩展性，学习端到端的能量景观并建模平衡动态，实现不确定性感知推理和动态计算分配。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界任务中，EBT-Policy始终优于基于扩散的策略，训练和推理计算需求更少，某些任务仅需2步推理（相比扩散策略的100步减少50倍），并展现出零样本恢复等新兴能力。

Conclusion: EBT-Policy为在分布偏移下实现鲁棒、可泛化的机器人行为提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: Implicit policies parameterized by generative models, such as Diffusion
Policy, have become the standard for policy learning and Vision-Language-Action
(VLA) models in robotics. However, these approaches often suffer from high
computational cost, exposure bias, and unstable inference dynamics, which lead
to divergence under distribution shifts. Energy-Based Models (EBMs) address
these issues by learning energy landscapes end-to-end and modeling equilibrium
dynamics, offering improved robustness and reduced exposure bias. Yet, policies
parameterized by EBMs have historically struggled to scale effectively. Recent
work on Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) demonstrates the scalability of EBMs
to high-dimensional spaces, but their potential for solving core challenges in
physically embodied models remains underexplored. We introduce a new
energy-based architecture, EBT-Policy, that solves core issues in robotic and
real-world settings. Across simulated and real-world tasks, EBT-Policy
consistently outperforms diffusion-based policies, while requiring less
training and inference computation. Remarkably, on some tasks it converges
within just two inference steps, a 50x reduction compared to Diffusion Policy's
100. Moreover, EBT-Policy exhibits emergent capabilities not seen in prior
models, such as zero-shot recovery from failed action sequences using only
behavior cloning and without explicit retry training. By leveraging its scalar
energy for uncertainty-aware inference and dynamic compute allocation,
EBT-Policy offers a promising path toward robust, generalizable robot behavior
under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Biological systems, such as the octopus, exhibit masterful cross-scale
manipulation by adaptively reconfiguring their entire form, a capability that
remains elusive in robotics. Conventional soft grippers, while compliant, are
mostly constrained by a fixed global morphology, and prior shape-morphing
efforts have been largely confined to localized deformations, failing to
replicate this biological dexterity. Inspired by this natural exemplar, we
introduce the paradigm of collaborative, whole-body proprioceptive morphing,
realized in a modular soft gripper architecture. Our design is a distributed
network of modular self-sensing pneumatic actuators that enables the gripper to
intelligently reconfigure its entire topology, achieving multiple morphing
states that are controllable to form diverse polygonal shapes. By integrating
rich proprioceptive feedback from embedded sensors, our system can seamlessly
transition from a precise pinch to a large envelope grasp. We experimentally
demonstrate that this approach expands the grasping envelope and enhances
generalization across diverse object geometries (standard and irregular) and
scales (up to 10$\times$), while also unlocking novel manipulation modalities
such as multi-object and internal hook grasping. This work presents a low-cost,
easy-to-fabricate, and scalable framework that fuses distributed actuation with
integrated sensing, offering a new pathway toward achieving biological levels
of dexterity in robotic manipulation.
