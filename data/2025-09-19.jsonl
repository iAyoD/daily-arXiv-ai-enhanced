Solving it requires addressing three key\nchallenges: the non-convexity of free space due to obstacles,\nquadrotor-specific dynamics and objectives, and the need for exploration of\nunknown regions to find a path to the goal. Recently, the Model Predictive Path\nIntegral (MPPI) method has emerged as a promising solution that solves the\nfirst two challenges. By leveraging sampling-based optimization, it can\neffectively handle non-convex free space while directly optimizing over the\nfull quadrotor dynamics, enabling the inclusion of quadrotor-specific costs\nsuch as energy consumption. However, its performance in unknown environments is\nlimited, as it lacks the ability to explore unknown regions when blocked by\nlarge obstacles. To solve this issue, we introduce Perception-Aware MPPI\n(PA-MPPI). Here, perception-awareness is defined as adapting the trajectory\nonline based on perception objectives. Specifically, when the goal is occluded,\nPA-MPPI's perception cost biases trajectories that can perceive unknown\nregions. This expands the mapped traversable space and increases the likelihood\nof finding alternative paths to the goal. Through hardware experiments, we\ndemonstrate that PA-MPPI, running at 50 Hz with our efficient perception and\nmapping module, performs up to 100% better than the baseline in our challenging\nsettings where the state-of-the-art MPPI fails. In addition, we demonstrate\nthat PA-MPPI can be used as a safe and robust action policy for navigation\nfoundation models, which often provide goal poses that are not directly\nreachable."}

Existing single-view approaches often fail in\nunstructured environments due to limited fields of view, exploration, and\ngeneralization abilities. Moreover, classical controllers, although stable,\nstruggle with efficiency and manipulability near singularities. To address\nthese challenges, we propose M4Diffuser, a hybrid framework that integrates a\nMulti-View Diffusion Policy with a novel Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP\n(ReM-QP) controller for mobile manipulation. The diffusion policy leverages\nproprioceptive states and complementary camera perspectives with both\nclose-range object details and global scene context to generate task-relevant\nend-effector goals in the world frame. These high-level goals are then executed\nby the ReM-QP controller, which eliminates slack variables for computational\nefficiency and incorporates manipulability-aware preferences for robustness\nnear singularities. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world\nenvironments show that M4Diffuser achieves 7 to 56 percent higher success rates\nand reduces collisions by 3 to 31 percent over baselines. Our approach\ndemonstrates robust performance for smooth whole-body coordination, and strong\ngeneralization to unseen tasks, paving the way for reliable mobile manipulation\nin unstructured environments.

Recently, advances in VLAs have offered a path toward this\ngoal. However, most current VLA-based embodied agents operate in a one-way\nmode: they receive an instruction and execute it without feedback. This\napproach fails in real-world scenarios where instructions are often ambiguous.\nIn this paper, we address this problem with the Ask-to-Clarify framework. Our\nframework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking questions in a\nmulti-turn dialogue. Then it generates low-level actions end-to-end.\nSpecifically, the Ask-to-Clarify framework consists of two components, one VLM\nfor collaboration and one diffusion for action. We also introduce a connection\nmodule that generates conditions for the diffusion based on the output of the\nVLM. This module adjusts the observation by instructions to create reliable\nconditions. We train our framework with a two-stage knowledge-insulation\nstrategy. First, we fine-tune the collaboration component using\nambiguity-solving dialogue data to handle ambiguity. Then, we integrate the\naction component while freezing the collaboration one. This preserves the\ninteraction abilities while fine-tuning the diffusion to generate actions. The\ntraining strategy guarantees our framework can first ask questions, then\ngenerate actions. During inference, a signal detector functions as a router\nthat helps our framework switch between asking questions and taking actions. We\nevaluate the Ask-to-Clarify framework in 8 real-world tasks, where it\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art VLAs. The results suggest that our\nproposed framework, along with the training strategy, provides a path toward\ncollaborative embodied agents."}
