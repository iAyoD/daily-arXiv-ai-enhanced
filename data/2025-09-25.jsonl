Achieving both capabilities under degraded sensing and without global\nlocalization remains an open challenge. Recent works on relative navigation\nhave shown robust tracking by anchoring planning and control to a visible\ndetected object, but cannot address navigation when no target is in the field\nof view. We present HUNT (High-speed UAV Navigation and Tracking), a real-time\nframework that unifies traversal, acquisition, and tracking within a single\nrelative formulation. HUNT defines navigation objectives directly from onboard\ninstantaneous observables such as attitude, altitude, and velocity, enabling\nreactive high-speed flight during search.

However,\nexisting blind locomotion controllers often struggle to ensure safety and\nefficient traversal through risky gap terrains, which are typically highly\ncomplex, requiring robots to perceive terrain information and select\nappropriate footholds during locomotion accurately. Meanwhile, existing\nperception-based controllers still present several practical limitations,\nincluding a complex multi-sensor deployment system and expensive computing\nresource requirements. This paper proposes a DRL controller named MAstering\nRisky Gap Terrains (MARG), which integrates terrain maps and proprioception to\ndynamically adjust the action and enhance the robot's stability in these tasks.\nDuring the training phase, our controller accelerates policy optimization by\nselectively incorporating privileged information (e.g., center of mass,\nfriction coefficients) that are available in simulation but unmeasurable\ndirectly in real-world deployments due to sensor limitations. We also designed\nthree foot-related rewards to encourage the robot to explore safe footholds.\nMore importantly, a terrain map generation (TMG) model is proposed to reduce\nthe drift existing in mapping and provide accurate terrain maps using only one\nLiDAR, providing a foundation for zero-shot transfer of the learned policy.

To address this, we\nintroduce the 3D Queryable Scene Representation (3D QSR), a novel framework\nbuilt on multimedia data that unifies three complementary 3D representations:\n(1) 3D-consistent novel view rendering and segmentation from panoptic\nreconstruction, (2) precise geometry from 3D point clouds, and (3) structured,\nscalable organization via 3D scene graphs.
