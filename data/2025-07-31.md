Abstract: Physics Engines (PEs) are fundamental software frameworks that simulate
physical interactions in applications ranging from entertainment to
safety-critical systems. Despite their importance, PEs suffer from physics
failures, deviations from expected physical behaviors that can compromise
software reliability, degrade user experience, and potentially cause critical
failures in autonomous vehicles or medical robotics. Current testing approaches
for PE-based software are inadequate, typically requiring white-box access and
focusing on crash detection rather than semantically complex physics failures.
This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study characterizing
physics failures in PE-based software. We investigate three research questions
addressing the manifestations of physics failures, the effectiveness of
detection techniques, and developer perceptions of current detection practices.
Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of physics failure manifestations;
(2) a comprehensive evaluation of detection methods including deep learning,
prompt-based techniques, and large multimodal models; and (3) actionable
insights from developer experiences for improving detection approaches. To
support future research, we release PhysiXFails, code, and other materials at
https://sites.google.com/view/physics-failure-detection.

### [2] [Trade-offs in Image Generation: How Do Different Dimensions Interact?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22100)
*Sicheng Zhang,Binzhu Xie,Zhonghao Yan,Yuli Zhang,Donghao Zhou,Xiaofei Chen,Shi Qiu,Jiaqi Liu,Guoyang Xie,Zhichao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了TRIG-Bench和TRIGScore，用于量化文本到图像和图像到图像生成模型在多维度上的权衡，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对生成模型在多维度（如质量、对齐、多样性等）上复杂权衡的探索，主要因为数据集和评估方法的不足。

Method: 引入TRIG-Bench数据集（覆盖10个维度、40,200样本）和TRIGScore评估指标，并开发了Relation Recognition System生成维度权衡图（DTM）。

Result: 实验评估了14个模型，DTM能全面展示模型在维度间的权衡，且通过微调可提升模型性能。

Conclusion: TRIG-Bench和TRIGScore为生成模型的评估提供了新工具，DTM能帮助理解并优化模型在多维度上的表现。

Abstract: Model performance in text-to-image (T2I) and image-to-image (I2I) generation
often depends on multiple aspects, including quality, alignment, diversity, and
robustness. However, models' complex trade-offs among these dimensions have
rarely been explored due to (1) the lack of datasets that allow fine-grained
quantification of these trade-offs, and (2) the use of a single metric for
multiple dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG-Bench (Trade-offs in
Image Generation), which spans 10 dimensions (Realism, Originality, Aesthetics,
Content, Relation, Style, Knowledge, Ambiguity, Toxicity, and Bias), contains
40,200 samples, and covers 132 pairwise dimensional subsets. Furthermore, we
develop TRIGScore, a VLM-as-judge metric that automatically adapts to various
dimensions. Based on TRIG-Bench and TRIGScore, we evaluate 14 models across T2I
and I2I tasks. In addition, we propose the Relation Recognition System to
generate the Dimension Trade-off Map (DTM) that visualizes the trade-offs among
model-specific capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that DTM consistently
provides a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between dimensions for
each type of generative model. Notably, we show that the model's
dimension-specific weaknesses can be mitigated through fine-tuning on DTM to
enhance overall performance. Code is available at:

Abstract: Crops, fisheries and livestock form the backbone of global food production,
essential to feed the ever-growing global population. However, these sectors
face considerable challenges, including climate variability, resource
limitations, and the need for sustainable management. Addressing these issues
requires efficient, accurate, and scalable technological solutions,
highlighting the importance of artificial intelligence (AI). This survey

techniques (e.g., vision transformers), and recent vision-language foundation
models (e.g., CLIP) in the agriculture domain, focusing on diverse tasks such
as crop disease detection, livestock health management, and aquatic species
monitoring. We further cover major implementation challenges such as data
variability and experimental aspects: datasets, performance evaluation metrics,
and geographical focus. We finish the survey by discussing potential open
research directions emphasizing the need for multimodal data integration,
efficient edge-device deployment, and domain-adaptable AI models for diverse
farming environments. Rapid growth of evolving developments in this field can

### [4] [Color as the Impetus: Transforming Few-Shot Learner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22136)
*Chaofei Qi,Zhitai Liu,Jianbin Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种受人类颜色感知启发的元学习框架ColorSense Learner，通过颜色通道特征提取和交互学习提升少样本分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类颜色感知能力对元学习有重要作用，但传统方法忽略了颜色特征。

Method: 提出ColorSense Learner框架，利用颜色通道交互提取特征，并引入ColorSense Distiller进行知识蒸馏。

Result: 在11个少样本基准测试中表现出强泛化性、鲁棒性和迁移性。

Conclusion: 通过颜色感知视角，有效提升了少样本分类性能。

Abstract: Humans possess innate meta-learning capabilities, partly attributable to
their exceptional color perception. In this paper, we pioneer an innovative
viewpoint on few-shot learning by simulating human color perception mechanisms.
We propose the ColorSense Learner, a bio-inspired meta-learning framework that
capitalizes on inter-channel feature extraction and interactive learning. By
strategically emphasizing distinct color information across different channels,
our approach effectively filters irrelevant features while capturing
discriminative characteristics. Color information represents the most intuitive
visual feature, yet conventional meta-learning methods have predominantly
neglected this aspect, focusing instead on abstract feature differentiation
across categories. Our framework bridges the gap via synergistic color-channel
interactions, enabling better intra-class commonality extraction and larger
inter-class differences. Furthermore, we introduce a meta-distiller based on
knowledge distillation, ColorSense Distiller, which incorporates prior teacher
knowledge to augment the student network's meta-learning capacity. We've
conducted comprehensive coarse/fine-grained and cross-domain experiments on
eleven few-shot benchmarks for validation. Numerous experiments reveal that our
methods have extremely strong generalization ability, robustness, and
transferability, and effortless handle few-shot classification from the
perspective of color perception.

TL;DR: 深度学习模型（nnU-Net）在儿童脑肿瘤MRI分割中表现良好，尤其对全肿瘤和T2高信号区域，但对增强肿瘤和囊性成分效果较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童脑肿瘤（PBTs）的诊断和治疗存在挑战，深度学习分割方法有望提供帮助，但其在不同肿瘤亚型和MRI协议中的性能尚不明确。

Method: 使用174例儿童患者的MRI数据（T1、T1-C、T2、FLAIR），训练3D nnU-Net模型，评估其在四种肿瘤子区域的分割性能。

Result: 模型在全肿瘤和T2高信号区域表现稳健（DSC: 0.85），接近人工标注变异性；增强肿瘤和囊性成分分割效果较差。

Conclusion: 深度学习在PBTs分割中可行，尤其对T2高信号和全肿瘤，但需进一步优化增强肿瘤和囊性成分的分割。支持简化MRI协议和自动化流程的潜力。

Abstract: Background Brain tumours are the most common solid malignancies in children,
encompassing diverse histological, molecular subtypes and imaging features and
outcomes. Paediatric brain tumours (PBTs), including high- and low-grade
gliomas (HGG, LGG), medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and rarer forms, pose
diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation
offers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across
heterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A
retrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG,
medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI
sequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual
annotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT),
T2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D
nnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation
performance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared
against intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust
performance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator
variability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean
DSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by
tumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location. Notably, T1, T1-C, and T2
alone produced results nearly equivalent to the full protocol. Conclusions DL
is feasible for PBTs, particularly for T2H and WT. Challenges remain for ET and
CC segmentation, highlighting the need for further refinement. These findings
support the potential for protocol simplification and automation to enhance
volumetric assessment and streamline paediatric neuro-oncology workflows.

### [6] [Temporally Consistent Unsupervised Segmentation for Mobile Robot Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22194)
*Christian Ellis,Maggie Wigness,Craig Lennon,Lance Fiondella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Frontier-Seg的无监督分割方法，用于移动机器人视频流中的地形分割，解决了现有方法在时间一致性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督语义分割方法依赖昂贵的数据标注，且无法适应无标签或语义模糊的未结构化环境。零样本无监督分割方法缺乏时间一致性，影响鲁棒性。

Method: Frontier-Seg通过聚类基础模型（DINOv2）提取的超像素级特征，并强制帧间时间一致性，实现无监督地形边界分割。

Result: 在RUGD和RELLIS-3D等数据集上验证了Frontier-Seg在未结构化环境中的无监督分割能力。

Conclusion: Frontier-Seg填补了无监督分割方法在时间一致性上的空白，适用于未结构化环境。

Abstract: Rapid progress in terrain-aware autonomous ground navigation has been driven
by advances in supervised semantic segmentation. However, these methods rely on
costly data collection and labor-intensive ground truth labeling to train deep
models. Furthermore, autonomous systems are increasingly deployed in
unrehearsed, unstructured environments where no labeled data exists and
semantic categories may be ambiguous or domain-specific. Recent zero-shot
approaches to unsupervised segmentation have shown promise in such settings but
typically operate on individual frames, lacking temporal consistency-a critical
property for robust perception in unstructured environments. To address this
gap we introduce Frontier-Seg, a method for temporally consistent unsupervised
segmentation of terrain from mobile robot video streams. Frontier-Seg clusters
superpixel-level features extracted from foundation model
backbones-specifically DINOv2-and enforces temporal consistency across frames
to identify persistent terrain boundaries or frontiers without human
supervision. We evaluate Frontier-Seg on a diverse set of benchmark
datasets-including RUGD and RELLIS-3D-demonstrating its ability to perform
unsupervised segmentation across unstructured off-road environments.

### [7] [SmartCLIP: Modular Vision-language Alignment with Identification Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22264)
*Shaoan Xie,Lingjing Kong,Yujia Zheng,Yu Yao,Zeyu Tang,Eric P. Xing,Guangyi Chen,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法SmartCLIP，解决了CLIP模型在图像-文本对齐中的信息错位和表征纠缠问题，通过模块化对齐提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在图像-文本对齐中存在信息错位和表征纠缠问题，限制了其在下游任务中的泛化能力。

Method: 提出理论条件，实现跨模态语义信息的保留和视觉表征的解耦，并引入SmartCLIP方法进行模块化对齐。

Result: SmartCLIP在多种任务中表现优异，验证了其处理信息错位的能力。

Conclusion: SmartCLIP通过灵活对齐和表征解耦，显著提升了模型性能，为多模态学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)~\citep{radford2021learning}
has emerged as a pivotal model in computer vision and multimodal learning,
achieving state-of-the-art performance at aligning visual and textual
representations through contrastive learning. However, CLIP struggles with
potential information misalignment in many image-text datasets and suffers from
entangled representation. On the one hand, short captions for a single image in
datasets like MSCOCO may describe disjoint regions in the image, leaving the
model uncertain about which visual features to retain or disregard. On the
other hand, directly aligning long captions with images can lead to the
retention of entangled details, preventing the model from learning
disentangled, atomic concepts -- ultimately limiting its generalization on
certain downstream tasks involving short prompts.
  In this paper, we establish theoretical conditions that enable flexible
alignment between textual and visual representations across varying levels of
granularity. Specifically, our framework ensures that a model can not only
\emph{preserve} cross-modal semantic information in its entirety but also
\emph{disentangle} visual representations to capture fine-grained textual
concepts. Building on this foundation, we introduce \ours, a novel approach
that identifies and aligns the most relevant visual and textual representations
in a modular manner. Superior performance across various tasks demonstrates its
capability to handle information misalignment and supports our identification
theory. The code is available at https://github.com/Mid-Push/SmartCLIP.

### [8] [HOG-CNN: Integrating Histogram of Oriented Gradients with Convolutional Neural Networks for Retinal Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22274)
*Faisal Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于HOG-CNN混合特征提取模型的自动化和可解释的临床决策支持框架，用于视网膜疾病的早期检测和诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视网膜疾病诊断依赖人工解释，耗时耗资源，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 结合手工HOG特征和深度学习CNN特征，构建HOG-CNN模型，捕捉局部纹理和高层语义特征。

Result: 在APTOS 2019、ORIGA和IC-AMD数据集上表现优异，如DR分类准确率98.5%，AMD诊断准确率92.8%。

Conclusion: HOG-CNN模型轻量且可解释，适合资源有限的临床环境，是自动化视网膜疾病筛查的强有力工具。

Abstract: The analysis of fundus images is critical for the early detection and
diagnosis of retinal diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, and
Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Traditional diagnostic workflows,
however, often depend on manual interpretation and are both time- and
resource-intensive. To address these limitations, we propose an automated and
interpretable clinical decision support framework based on a hybrid feature
extraction model called HOG-CNN. Our key contribution lies in the integration
of handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) representations. This fusion enables our
model to capture both local texture patterns and high-level semantic features
from retinal fundus images. We evaluated our model on three public benchmark
datasets: APTOS 2019 (for binary and multiclass DR classification), ORIGA (for
Glaucoma detection), and IC-AMD (for AMD diagnosis); HOG-CNN demonstrates
consistently high performance. It achieves 98.5\% accuracy and 99.2 AUC for
binary DR classification, and 94.2 AUC for five-class DR classification. On the
IC-AMD dataset, it attains 92.8\% accuracy, 94.8\% precision, and 94.5 AUC,
outperforming several state-of-the-art models. For Glaucoma detection on ORIGA,
our model achieves 83.9\% accuracy and 87.2 AUC, showing competitive
performance despite dataset limitations. We show, through comprehensive
appendix studies, the complementary strength of combining HOG and CNN features.
The model's lightweight and interpretable design makes it particularly suitable
for deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results
position HOG-CNN as a robust and scalable tool for automated retinal disease
screening.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlphaEarth Foundations提出了一种通用的地理空间嵌入模型，能够高效生成高质量地图和监测系统，无需重新训练即可超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测数据量大但高质量标签稀缺，需要一种通用模型来高效利用稀疏标签生成地图。

Method: 采用嵌入场模型，整合空间、时间和测量上下文的多源数据。

Result: 生成的嵌入在多样化地图评估中一致优于现有方法，无需重新训练。

Conclusion: AlphaEarth Foundations为全球地图和监测系统提供了一种高效、通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Unprecedented volumes of Earth observation data are continually collected
around the world, but high-quality labels remain scarce given the effort
required to make physical measurements and observations. This has led to
considerable investment in bespoke modeling efforts translating sparse labels
into maps. Here we introduce AlphaEarth Foundations, an embedding field model
yielding a highly general, geospatial representation that assimilates spatial,
temporal, and measurement contexts across multiple sources, enabling accurate
and efficient production of maps and monitoring systems from local to global
scales. The embeddings generated by AlphaEarth Foundations are the only to
consistently outperform all previous featurization approaches tested on a
diverse set of mapping evaluations without re-training. We will release a
dataset of global, annual, analysis-ready embedding field layers from 2017
through 2024.

### [10] [LAMA-Net: A Convergent Network Architecture for Dual-Domain Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22316)
*Chi Ding,Qingchao Zhang,Ge Wang,Xiaojing Ye,Yunmei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可学习的变分模型（LAMA），用于图像重建，结合图像和测量域的特征，并通过收敛性证明和实验验证其稳定性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过结合图像和测量域的互补信息，提升图像重建的性能，并验证算法的收敛性和稳定性。

Method: 提出LAMA算法，结合残差学习和近端交替框架，并进一步设计LAMA-Net和iLAMA-Net网络架构。

Result: 实验表明LAMA-Net/iLAMA-Net在稀疏视图CT重建中优于现有方法，且具有出色的稳定性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LAMA及其网络变体在图像重建任务中表现出色，收敛性证明和实验验证为其提供了理论支持和实际应用价值。

Abstract: We propose a learnable variational model that learns the features and
leverages complementary information from both image and measurement domains for
image reconstruction. In particular, we introduce a learned alternating
minimization algorithm (LAMA) from our prior work, which tackles two-block
nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems by incorporating a residual
learning architecture in a proximal alternating framework. In this work, our
goal is to provide a complete and rigorous convergence proof of LAMA and show
that all accumulation points of a specified subsequence of LAMA must be Clarke
stationary points of the problem. LAMA directly yields a highly interpretable
neural network architecture called LAMA-Net. Notably, in addition to the
results shown in our prior work, we demonstrate that the convergence property
of LAMA yields outstanding stability and robustness of LAMA-Net in this work.
We also show that the performance of LAMA-Net can be further improved by
integrating a properly designed network that generates suitable initials, which
we call iLAMA-Net. To evaluate LAMA-Net/iLAMA-Net, we conduct several
experiments and compare them with several state-of-the-art methods on popular
benchmark datasets for Sparse-View Computed Tomography.

### [11] [Learning from Heterogeneous Structural MRI via Collaborative Domain Adaptation for Late-Life Depression Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22321)
*Yuzhen Gao,Qianqian Wang,Yongheng Sun,Cui Wang,Yongquan Liang,Mingxia Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种协作域适应（CDA）框架，结合ViT和CNN，用于基于MRI的晚年抑郁症检测，解决了样本量小和域异质性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 晚年抑郁症（LLD）的准确识别对疾病监测和干预至关重要，但现有方法受限于小样本和域异质性。

Method: CDA框架分三阶段：源数据监督训练、目标特征自监督适应和协作训练，结合ViT和CNN提取全局与局部特征。

Result: 在多站点MRI数据上，CDA优于现有无监督域适应方法。

Conclusion: CDA框架有效提升了LLD检测的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate identification of late-life depression (LLD) using structural brain
MRI is essential for monitoring disease progression and facilitating timely
intervention. However, existing learning-based approaches for LLD detection are
often constrained by limited sample sizes (e.g., tens), which poses significant
challenges for reliable model training and generalization. Although
incorporating auxiliary datasets can expand the training set, substantial
domain heterogeneity, such as differences in imaging protocols, scanner
hardware, and population demographics, often undermines cross-domain
transferability. To address this issue, we propose a Collaborative Domain
Adaptation (CDA) framework for LLD detection using T1-weighted MRIs. The CDA
leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture global anatomical context and a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local structural features, with
each branch comprising an encoder and a classifier. The CDA framework consists
of three stages: (a) supervised training on labeled source data, (b)
self-supervised target feature adaptation and (c) collaborative training on
unlabeled target data. We first train ViT and CNN on source data, followed by
self-supervised target feature adaptation by minimizing the discrepancy between
classifier outputs from two branches to make the categorical boundary clearer.
The collaborative training stage employs pseudo-labeled and augmented
target-domain MRIs, enforcing prediction consistency under strong and weak
augmentation to enhance domain robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments conducted on multi-site T1-weighted MRI data demonstrate that the
CDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无姿态、前馈的3D高斯溅射框架，用于处理不利输入视角，通过低秩适应层和几何一致性增强模块提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖有利视角输入，限制了在真实场景中的应用，需解决不利视角下的渲染问题。

Method: 引入低秩适应层和几何一致性增强模块，结合高斯对齐方法和新训练策略，利用有利视角数据集进行训练。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能够处理不利输入视角。

Conclusion: 提出的框架扩展了3D高斯溅射模型在真实场景中的应用范围。

Abstract: This paper presents a pose-free, feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework designed to handle unfavorable input views. A common rendering setup
for training feed-forward approaches places a 3D object at the world origin and
renders it from cameras pointed toward the origin -- i.e., from favorable
views, limiting the applicability of these models to real-world scenarios
involving varying and unknown camera poses. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a novel adaptation framework that enables pretrained pose-free
feed-forward 3DGS models to handle unfavorable views. We leverage priors
learned from favorable images by feeding recentered images into a pretrained
model augmented with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers. We further propose a
Gaussian adapter module to enhance the geometric consistency of the Gaussians
derived from the recentered inputs, along with a Gaussian alignment method to
render accurate target views for training. Additionally, we introduce a new
training strategy that utilizes an off-the-shelf dataset composed solely of
favorable images. Experimental results on both synthetic images from the Google
Scanned Objects dataset and real images from the OmniObject3D dataset validate
the effectiveness of our method in handling unfavorable input views.

*Ziyi Wang,Peiming Li,Hong Liu,Zhichao Deng,Can Wang,Jun Liu,Junsong Yuan,Mengyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了ACTIVE数据集和ACTIVE-PC方法，用于解决自然人机交互（N-HRI）中动作识别的复杂性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动作识别基准无法满足N-HRI的灵活性需求，数据、模态和多样性不足。

Method: 提出ACTIVE数据集（30类动作、80名参与者、46,868视频实例）和ACTIVE-PC方法（多级邻域采样、分层识别器等）。

Result: 实验证明ACTIVE-PC在长距离动作识别中有效。

Conclusion: ACTIVE和ACTIVE-PC为N-HRI中的动作识别研究提供了新基准和方法。

Abstract: Natural Human-Robot Interaction (N-HRI) requires robots to recognize human
actions at varying distances and states, regardless of whether the robot itself
is in motion or stationary. This setup is more flexible and practical than
conventional human action recognition tasks. However, existing benchmarks
designed for traditional action recognition fail to address the unique
complexities in N-HRI due to limited data, modalities, task categories, and
diversity of subjects and environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce ACTIVE (Action from Robotic View), a large-scale dataset tailored
specifically for perception-centric robotic views prevalent in mobile service
robots. ACTIVE comprises 30 composite action categories, 80 participants, and
46,868 annotated video instances, covering both RGB and point cloud modalities.
Participants performed various human actions in diverse environments at
distances ranging from 3m to 50m, while the camera platform was also mobile,
simulating real-world scenarios of robot perception with varying camera heights
due to uneven ground. This comprehensive and challenging benchmark aims to
advance action and attribute recognition research in N-HRI. Furthermore, we
propose ACTIVE-PC, a method that accurately perceives human actions at long
distances using Multilevel Neighborhood Sampling, Layered Recognizers, Elastic
Ellipse Query, and precise decoupling of kinematic interference from human
actions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACTIVE-PC. Our
code is available at:

Conclusion: RSICA和DeltaVLM为遥感图像变化分析提供了新的交互式解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of land-cover changes in multi-temporal satellite
imagery is critical for real-world scenarios. However, existing methods
typically provide only one-shot change masks or static captions, limiting their
ability to support interactive, query-driven analysis. In this work, we
introduce remote sensing image change analysis (RSICA) as a new paradigm that
combines the strengths of change detection and visual question answering to
enable multi-turn, instruction-guided exploration of changes in bi-temporal
remote sensing images. To support this task, we construct ChangeChat-105k, a
large-scale instruction-following dataset, generated through a hybrid
rule-based and GPT-assisted process, covering six interaction types: change
captioning, classification, quantification, localization, open-ended question
answering, and multi-turn dialogues. Building on this dataset, we propose
DeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture tailored for interactive RSICA. DeltaVLM
features three innovations: (1) a fine-tuned bi-temporal vision encoder to
capture temporal differences; (2) a visual difference perception module with a
cross-semantic relation measuring (CSRM) mechanism to interpret changes; and
(3) an instruction-guided Q-former to effectively extract query-relevant
difference information from visual changes, aligning them with textual
instructions. We train DeltaVLM on ChangeChat-105k using a frozen large
language model, adapting only the vision and alignment modules to optimize
efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that
DeltaVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-turn captioning
and multi-turn interactive change analysis, outperforming existing multimodal
large language models and remote sensing vision-language models. Code, dataset
and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/hanlinwu/DeltaVLM.

*Yunseok Oh,Dong-Wan Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为GFD的新任务，结合了传统人脸识别与广义类别发现（GCD），并提出了FaceGCD方法，通过动态构建特征提取器来解决高基数与细粒度ID的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在实现开放世界人脸识别，同时识别已知和未知身份，推动人工通用智能（AGI）发展。

Method: 提出FaceGCD方法，利用轻量级层前缀动态生成特征提取器，由HyperNetwork根据输入图像自适应生成前缀。

Result: FaceGCD在GFD任务中显著优于现有GCD方法和ArcFace基线，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: FaceGCD为开放世界人脸识别提供了有效解决方案，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Recognizing and differentiating among both familiar and unfamiliar faces is a
critical capability for face recognition systems and a key step toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI). Motivated by this ability, this paper
introduces generalized face discovery (GFD), a novel open-world face
recognition task that unifies traditional face identification with generalized
category discovery (GCD). GFD requires recognizing both labeled and unlabeled
known identities (IDs) while simultaneously discovering new, previously unseen
IDs. Unlike typical GCD settings, GFD poses unique challenges due to the high
cardinality and fine-grained nature of face IDs, rendering existing GCD
approaches ineffective. To tackle this problem, we propose FaceGCD, a method
that dynamically constructs instance-specific feature extractors using
lightweight, layer-wise prefixes. These prefixes are generated on the fly by a
HyperNetwork, which adaptively outputs a set of prefix generators conditioned
on each input image. This dynamic design enables FaceGCD to capture subtle
identity-specific cues without relying on high-capacity static models.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that FaceGCD significantly outperforms
existing GCD methods and a strong face recognition baseline, ArcFace, achieving
state-of-the-art results on the GFD task and advancing toward open-world face
recognition.

but can also generate higher resolution videos and higher IPC without
significantly increasing computational cost.

Motivation: 理解个体、群体和事件层面的情绪及其上下文信息对分析多人社交场景至关重要。现有研究主要关注基于时间感知的原子交互和群体层面情绪，缺乏细粒度分析。

Method: 采用多模态Swin-Transformer和S3Attention架构，结合场景、群体成员和上下文信息，联合预测离散和连续情绪（如效价和唤醒度）。

Result: 在VGAF-GEMS基准测试中，GEMS框架在定量和定性比较中优于现有方法，实现了对个体、群体和事件层面情绪的综合分析。

Conclusion: GEMS框架为情绪理解研究提供了新方向，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Understanding individual, group and event level emotions along with
contextual information is crucial for analyzing a multi-person social
situation. To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of
predicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event
level emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer
and S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group
members, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing
multi-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions
primarily based on emotion perception over time and group level. To this end,
we extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic
analysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims
to predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and
arousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions. Our
benchmarking effort links individual, group and situational emotional responses
holistically. The quantitative and qualitative comparisons with adapted
state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of GEMS framework on
VGAF-GEMS benchmarking. We believe that it will pave the way of further
research. The code and data is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs在频率域扰动下的表现，以揭示其在真实性和自动化任务中的不可靠性。

Method: 设计频率域的目标图像变换，测试五种先进VLMs对扰动的敏感性。

Result: 实验表明，VLMs对频率扰动敏感，其输出与语义内容不完全一致。

Conclusion: VLMs在频率扰动下表现脆弱，需开发更鲁棒的多模态感知系统。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used as perceptual modules for
visual content reasoning, including through captioning and DeepFake detection.
In this work, we expose a critical vulnerability of VLMs when exposed to
subtle, structured perturbations in the frequency domain. Specifically, we
highlight how these feature transformations undermine authenticity/DeepFake
detection and automated image captioning tasks. We design targeted image
transformations, operating in the frequency domain to systematically adjust VLM
outputs when exposed to frequency-perturbed real and synthetic images. We
demonstrate that the perturbation injection method generalizes across five
state-of-the-art VLMs which includes different-parameter Qwen2/2.5 and BLIP
models. Experimenting across ten real and generated image datasets reveals that
VLM judgments are sensitive to frequency-based cues and may not wholly align
with semantic content. Crucially, we show that visually-imperceptible spatial
frequency transformations expose the fragility of VLMs deployed for automated
image captioning and authenticity detection tasks. Our findings under
realistic, black-box constraints challenge the reliability of VLMs,
underscoring the need for robust multimodal perception systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MAE在掩码策略依赖性和分布外数据性能下降的问题。

Result: MINR在域内和域外场景均优于MAE，同时降低模型复杂度。

Conclusion: MINR是一种高效且鲁棒的替代方案，适用于多种自监督学习任务。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning methods like masked autoencoders (MAE) have shown
significant promise in learning robust feature representations, particularly in
image reconstruction-based pretraining task. However, their performance is
often strongly dependent on the masking strategies used during training and can
degrade when applied to out-of-distribution data. To address these limitations,
we introduce the masked implicit neural representations (MINR) framework that
synergizes implicit neural representations with masked image modeling. MINR
learns a continuous function to represent images, enabling more robust and
generalizable reconstructions irrespective of masking strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that MINR not only outperforms MAE in in-domain
scenarios but also in out-of-distribution settings, while reducing model
complexity. The versatility of MINR extends to various self-supervised learning
applications, confirming its utility as a robust and efficient alternative to
existing frameworks.

Conclusion: MZNet是一种高效实用的解决方案，适用于实际应用中的摩尔纹消除。

Abstract: Moir\'e patterns, caused by frequency aliasing between fine repetitive
structures and a camera sensor's sampling process, have been a significant
obstacle in various real-world applications, such as consumer photography and
industrial defect inspection. With the advancements in deep learning
algorithms, numerous studies-predominantly based on convolutional neural
networks-have suggested various solutions to address this issue. Despite these
efforts, existing approaches still struggle to effectively eliminate artifacts
due to the diverse scales, orientations, and color shifts of moir\'e patterns,
primarily because the constrained receptive field of CNN-based architectures
limits their ability to capture the complex characteristics of moir\'e
patterns. In this paper, we propose MZNet, a U-shaped network designed to bring
images closer to a 'Moire-Zero' state by effectively removing moir\'e patterns.
It integrates three specialized components: Multi-Scale Dual Attention Block
(MSDAB) for extracting and refining multi-scale features, Multi-Shape Large
Kernel Convolution Block (MSLKB) for capturing diverse moir\'e structures, and
Feature Fusion-Based Skip Connection for enhancing information flow. Together,
these components enhance local texture restoration and large-scale artifact
suppression. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MZNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance on high-resolution datasets and delivers
competitive results on lower-resolution dataset, while maintaining a low
computational cost, suggesting that it is an efficient and practical solution
for real-world applications. Project page:

Conclusion: UAVScenes填补了多模态无人机感知的空白，为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Multi-modal perception is essential for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
operations, as it enables a comprehensive understanding of the UAVs'
surrounding environment. However, most existing multi-modal UAV datasets are
primarily biased toward localization and 3D reconstruction tasks, or only
support map-level semantic segmentation due to the lack of frame-wise
annotations for both camera images and LiDAR point clouds. This limitation
prevents them from being used for high-level scene understanding tasks. To
address this gap and advance multi-modal UAV perception, we introduce
UAVScenes, a large-scale dataset designed to benchmark various tasks across
both 2D and 3D modalities. Our benchmark dataset is built upon the
well-calibrated multi-modal UAV dataset MARS-LVIG, originally developed only
for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We enhance this dataset by
providing manually labeled semantic annotations for both frame-wise images and
LiDAR point clouds, along with accurate 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) poses.
These additions enable a wide range of UAV perception tasks, including
segmentation, depth estimation, 6-DoF localization, place recognition, and
novel view synthesis (NVS). Our dataset is available at

Result: 实验表明，该方法不仅分割精度高，还能生成反映数据分布的不确定性图。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效捕捉边界模糊区域的不确定性，提供更可靠的分割结果。

Abstract: Quantifying aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation is critical
since it is a reflection of the natural variability observed among expert
annotators. A conventional approach is to model the segmentation distribution
using the generative model, but current methods limit the expression ability of
generative models. While current diffusion-based approaches have demonstrated
impressive performance in approximating the data distribution, their inherent
stochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities limit their
effectiveness in accurately capturing uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed
method leverages conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based
generative model that learns an exact density, to produce highly accurate
segmentation results. By guiding the flow model on the input image and sampling
multiple data points, our approach synthesizes segmentation samples whose
pixel-wise variance reliably reflects the underlying data distribution. This
sampling strategy captures uncertainties in regions with ambiguous boundaries,
offering robust quantification that mirrors inter-annotator differences.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves competitive
segmentation accuracy but also generates uncertainty maps that provide deeper
insights into the reliability of the segmentation outcomes. The code for this

Motivation: 探索如何利用LVLMs提升图像-文本对数据的质量，形成自我强化的循环改进机制。

Method: 通过LVLM处理图像和原始文本，生成四种互补的文本标注（长/短正负描述），并扩展对比学习范式以利用这些标注。

Conclusion: 通过LVLM驱动的数据优化和训练范式改进，实现了数据质量和模型性能的双重提升。

Abstract: Large-scale but noisy image-text pair data have paved the way for the success
of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP). As the foundation vision
encoder, CLIP in turn serves as the cornerstone for most large vision-language
models (LVLMs). This interdependence naturally raises an interesting question:
Can we reciprocally leverage LVLMs to enhance the quality of image-text pair
data, thereby opening the possibility of a self-reinforcing cycle for
continuous improvement? In this work, we take a significant step toward this
vision by introducing an LVLM-driven data refinement pipeline. Our framework
leverages LVLMs to process images and their raw alt-text, generating four
complementary textual formulas: long positive descriptions, long negative
descriptions, short positive tags, and short negative tags. Applying this
pipeline to the curated DFN-Large dataset yields VLM-150M, a refined dataset
enriched with multi-grained annotations. Based on this dataset, we further
propose a training paradigm that extends conventional contrastive learning by
incorporating negative descriptions and short tags as additional supervised
signals. The resulting model, namely HQ-CLIP, demonstrates remarkable
improvements across diverse benchmarks. Within a comparable training data
scale, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
classification, cross-modal retrieval, and fine-grained visual understanding
tasks. In retrieval benchmarks, HQ-CLIP even surpasses standard CLIP models
trained on the DFN-2B dataset, which contains 10$\times$ more training data
than ours. All code, data, and models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运动模糊和低光条件导致传统姿态估计模型性能下降，现有数据集假设条件稳定，无法适应模糊环境。

Method: 利用事件相机的高时间分辨率数据生成运动感知模糊图像，结合师生框架和互不确定性掩码优化伪标签。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在运动模糊环境下优于传统域适应方法，无需目标域标注即可实现鲁棒姿态估计。

Conclusion: 事件相机为真实运动模糊环境中的域适应提供了可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Human pose estimation is critical for applications such as rehabilitation,
sports analytics, and AR/VR systems. However, rapid motion and low-light
conditions often introduce motion blur, significantly degrading pose estimation
due to the domain gap between sharp and blurred images. Most datasets assume
stable conditions, making models trained on sharp images struggle in blurred
environments. To address this, we introduce a novel domain adaptation approach
that leverages event cameras, which capture high temporal resolution motion
data and are inherently robust to motion blur. Using event-based augmentation,
we generate motion-aware blurred images, effectively bridging the domain gap
between sharp and blurred domains without requiring paired annotations.
Additionally, we develop a student-teacher framework that iteratively refines
pseudo-labels, leveraging mutual uncertainty masking to eliminate incorrect
labels and enable more effective learning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach outperforms conventional domain-adaptive human pose
estimation methods, achieving robust pose estimation under motion blur without
requiring annotations in the target domain. Our findings highlight the
potential of event cameras as a scalable and effective solution for domain
adaptation in real-world motion blur environments. Our project codes are

Abstract: LiDAR scene generation is critical for mitigating real-world LiDAR data
collection costs and enhancing the robustness of downstream perception tasks in
autonomous driving. However, existing methods commonly struggle to capture
geometric realism and global topological consistency. Recent LiDAR Diffusion
Models (LiDMs) predominantly embed LiDAR points into the latent space for
improved generation efficiency, which limits their interpretable ability to
model detailed geometric structures and preserve global topological
consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TopoLiDM, a novel
framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with diffusion models
under topological regularization for high-fidelity LiDAR generation. Our
approach first trains a topological-preserving VAE to extract latent graph
representations by graph construction and multiple graph convolutional layers.
Then we freeze the VAE and generate novel latent topological graphs through the
latent diffusion models. We also introduce 0-dimensional persistent homology
(PH) constraints, ensuring the generated LiDAR scenes adhere to real-world
global topological structures. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset
demonstrate TopoLiDM's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving
improvements of 22.6% lower Frechet Range Image Distance (FRID) and 9.2% lower
Minimum Matching Distance (MMD). Notably, our model also enables fast
generation speed with an average inference time of 1.68 samples/s, showcasing
its scalability for real-world applications. We will release the related codes

### [30] [Exploiting Diffusion Prior for Task-driven Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22459)

TL;DR: 论文提出EDTR方法，利用扩散先验恢复任务相关细节，提升多复杂退化场景下的任务性能和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有任务驱动图像恢复方法难以处理多复杂退化图像的问题，并探索扩散先验在恢复任务相关细节上的潜力。

Method: 提出EDTR方法，通过从预恢复的低质量图像中提取有用线索，并在扩散过程中加入轻微噪声，同时减少去噪步骤以避免冗余细节。

Result: EDTR显著提升了多复杂退化场景下的任务性能和视觉质量。

Conclusion: EDTR成功利用扩散先验解决了任务驱动图像恢复中的挑战，为多退化场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Task-driven image restoration (TDIR) has recently emerged to address
performance drops in high-level vision tasks caused by low-quality (LQ) inputs.
Previous TDIR methods struggle to handle practical scenarios in which images
are degraded by multiple complex factors, leaving minimal clues for
restoration. This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most
powerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help
generate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details
remains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address
this, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior
to restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging
useful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from
pixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we
employ a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant
details that dilute crucial task-related information. We demonstrate that our
method effectively utilizes diffusion prior for TDIR, significantly enhancing
task performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with multiple complex
degradations.

Abstract: Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (UVOS) aims to predict pixel-level
masks for the most salient objects in videos without any prior annotations.
While memory mechanisms have been proven critical in various video segmentation
paradigms, their application in UVOS yield only marginal performance gains
despite sophisticated design. Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental
flaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic
features. UVOS inherently suffers from the deficiency of lacking fine-grained
information due to the absence of pixel-level prior knowledge. Consequently,
memory design relying solely on high-level features, which predominantly
capture abstract semantic cues, is insufficient to generate precise
predictions. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose a novel hierarchical
memory architecture to incorporate both shallow- and high-level features for
memory, which leverages the complementary benefits of pixel and semantic
information. Furthermore, to balance the simultaneous utilization of the pixel
and semantic memory features, we propose a heterogeneous interaction mechanism
to perform pixel-semantic mutual interactions, which explicitly considers their
inherent feature discrepancies. Through the design of Pixel-guided Local
Alignment Module (PLAM) and Semantic-guided Global Integration Module (SGIM),
we achieve delicate integration of the fine-grained details in shallow-level
memory and the semantic representations in high-level memory. Our Hierarchical
Memory with Heterogeneous Interaction Network (HMHI-Net) consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all UVOS and video saliency detection
benchmarks. Moreover, HMHI-Net consistently exhibits high performance across
different backbones, further demonstrating its superiority and robustness.

Motivation: 深度伪造技术对数字媒体和身份验证等领域构成威胁，现有检测方法仅依赖图像域分类器，缺乏辅助任务提升鲁棒性。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型的零样本能力，提出VLM方法，并在60,000张图像的高质量数据集上进行评估。

Result: 零样本模型表现优于现有方法，InstructBLIP架构在DFDC-P数据集上零样本和微调场景下均优于传统分类器。

Conclusion: VLM在深度伪造检测中优于传统方法，展示了零样本学习的潜力。

Abstract: The contemporary phenomenon of deepfakes, utilizing GAN or diffusion models
for face swapping, presents a substantial and evolving threat in digital media,
identity verification, and a multitude of other systems. The majority of
existing methods for detecting deepfakes rely on training specialized
classifiers to distinguish between genuine and manipulated images, focusing
only on the image domain without incorporating any auxiliary tasks that could
enhance robustness. In this paper, inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of
Vision Language Models, we propose a novel VLM-based approach to image
classification and then evaluate it for deepfake detection. Specifically, we
utilize a new high-quality deepfake dataset comprising 60,000 images, on which
our zero-shot models demonstrate superior performance to almost all existing
methods. Subsequently, we compare the performance of the best-performing
architecture, InstructBLIP, on the popular deepfake dataset DFDC-P against
traditional methods in two scenarios: zero-shot and in-domain fine-tuning. Our
results demonstrate the superiority of VLMs over traditional classifiers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在多模态裂缝分割中缺乏自适应感知和高效跨模态特征融合的问题。

Method: LIDAR由LacaVSS和LD3CF模块组成，分别通过EDG-SS策略和AFDP技术实现自适应线索建模与跨模态融合。

Result: 在三个数据集上表现优异，F1为0.8204，mIoU为0.8465，参数仅5.35M。

Conclusion: LIDAR在低计算成本下实现了高效的像素级裂缝分割，性能优于SOTA方法。

Abstract: Achieving pixel-level segmentation with low computational cost using
multimodal data remains a key challenge in crack segmentation tasks. Existing
methods lack the capability for adaptive perception and efficient interactive
fusion of cross-modal features. To address these challenges, we propose a
Lightweight Adaptive Cue-Aware Vision Mamba network (LIDAR), which efficiently
perceives and integrates morphological and textural cues from different
modalities under multimodal crack scenarios, generating clear pixel-level crack
segmentation maps. Specifically, LIDAR is composed of a Lightweight Adaptive
Cue-Aware Visual State Space module (LacaVSS) and a Lightweight Dual Domain
Dynamic Collaborative Fusion module (LD3CF). LacaVSS adaptively models crack
cues through the proposed mask-guided Efficient Dynamic Guided Scanning
Strategy (EDG-SS), while LD3CF leverages an Adaptive Frequency Domain
Perceptron (AFDP) and a dual-pooling fusion strategy to effectively capture
spatial and frequency-domain cues across modalities. Moreover, we design a
Lightweight Dynamically Modulated Multi-Kernel convolution (LDMK) to perceive
complex morphological structures with minimal computational overhead, replacing
most convolutional operations in LIDAR. Experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
On the light-field depth dataset, our method achieves 0.8204 in F1 and 0.8465
in mIoU with only 5.35M parameters. Code and datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如基于单应性的方法或网格流技术）在处理复杂非平面场景时表现不佳，需要一种更通用的相机运动估计方法。

Method: CamFlow结合物理基（来自相机几何）和随机基（用于复杂场景），并使用基于拉普拉斯分布的混合概率损失函数增强训练鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，CamFlow在多样场景中优于现有方法，尤其在零样本设置下表现出更强的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: CamFlow通过混合运动基和概率损失函数，显著提升了相机运动估计的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Estimating 2D camera motion is a fundamental computer vision task that models
the projection of 3D camera movements onto the 2D image plane. Current methods
rely on either homography-based approaches, limited to planar scenes, or
meshflow techniques that use grid-based local homographies but struggle with
complex non-linear transformations. A key insight of our work is that combining
flow fields from different homographies creates motion patterns that cannot be
represented by any single homography. We introduce CamFlow, a novel framework
that represents camera motion using hybrid motion bases: physical bases derived
from camera geometry and stochastic bases for complex scenarios. Our approach
includes a hybrid probabilistic loss function based on the Laplace distribution
that enhances training robustness. For evaluation, we create a new benchmark by
masking dynamic objects in existing optical flow datasets to isolate pure
camera motion. Experiments show CamFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse scenarios, demonstrating superior robustness and generalization
in zero-shot settings. Code and datasets are available at our project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有All-in-One模型难以捕捉多样化和局部化的天气退化模式，需要更有效的方法。

Result: 实验表明SSGformer在多样复杂天气退化处理上表现优越。

Conclusion: SSGformer通过频谱和空间分组注意力机制，显著提升了多天气图像恢复的性能。

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions cause diverse and complex degradation patterns,
driving the development of All-in-One (AiO) models. However, recent AiO
solutions still struggle to capture diverse degradations, since global
filtering methods like direct operations on the frequency domain fail to handle
highly variable and localized distortions. To address these issue, we propose
Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that
leverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather
image restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge
features using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via
Singular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to
effectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features
are integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions
based on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask,
we introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather
removal and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions.
We also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel
attention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise
relationships and spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments show the
superiority of our approach, validating its effectiveness in handling the
varied and intricate adverse weather degradations.

Abstract: Underwater images typically suffer from severe colour distortions, low
visibility, and reduced structural clarity due to complex optical effects such
as scattering and absorption, which greatly degrade their visual quality and
limit the performance of downstream visual perception tasks. Existing
enhancement methods often struggle to adaptively handle diverse degradation
conditions and fail to leverage underwater-specific physical priors
effectively. In this paper, we propose a degradation-aware conditional
diffusion model to enhance underwater images adaptively and robustly. Given a
degraded underwater image as input, we first predict its degradation level
using a lightweight dual-stream convolutional network, generating a continuous
degradation score as semantic guidance. Based on this score, we introduce a
novel conditional diffusion-based restoration network with a Swin UNet
backbone, enabling adaptive noise scheduling and hierarchical feature
refinement. To incorporate underwater-specific physical priors, we further
propose a degradation-guided adaptive feature fusion module and a hybrid loss
function that combines perceptual consistency, histogram matching, and
feature-level contrast. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method effectively restores underwater images with
superior colour fidelity, perceptual quality, and structural details. Compared
with SOTA approaches, our framework achieves significant improvements in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative visual assessments.

Abstract: The segmentation of the hepatic vasculature in surgical videos holds
substantial clinical significance in the context of hepatectomy procedures.
However, owing to the dearth of an appropriate dataset and the inherently
complex task characteristics, few researches have been reported in this domain.
To address this issue, we first introduce a high quality frame-by-frame
annotated hepatic vasculature dataset containing 35 long hepatectomy videos and
11442 high-resolution frames. On this basis, we propose a novel high-resolution
video vasculature segmentation network, dubbed as HRVVS. We innovatively embed
a pretrained visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) model into different layers
of the hierarchical encoder as prior information to reduce the information
degradation generated during the downsampling process. In addition, we designed
a dynamic memory decoder on a multi-view segmentation network to minimize the
transmission of redundant information while preserving more details between
frames. Extensive experiments on surgical video datasets demonstrate that our
proposed HRVVS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning provides a rehearsal-free solution by tuning
small sets of parameters while keeping pre-trained models frozen. To meet the
complex demands of sequential tasks, it is crucial to integrate task-specific
knowledge within prompts effectively. However, existing works rely on either
fixed learned prompts (i.e., prompts whose representations remain unchanged
during new task learning) or on prompts generated from an entangled task-shared
space, limiting the representational diversity of the integrated prompt. To
address this issue, we propose a novel prompt-evolving mechanism to adaptively
aggregate base prompts (i.e., task-specific prompts) into a unified prompt
while ensuring diversity. By transforming and aligning base prompts, both
previously learned and newly introduced, our approach continuously evolves
accumulated knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. We further introduce a
learnable probabilistic gate that adaptively determines which layers to
activate during the evolution process. We validate our method on image
classification and video action recognition tasks in class-incremental
learning, achieving average gains of 9.07% and 7.40% over existing methods
across all scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate identification of breast lesion subtypes can facilitate personalized
treatment and interventions. Ultrasound (US), as a safe and accessible imaging
modality, is extensively employed in breast abnormality screening and
diagnosis. However, the incidence of different subtypes exhibits a skewed
long-tailed distribution, posing significant challenges for automated
recognition. Generative augmentation provides a promising solution to rectify
data distribution. Inspired by this, we propose a dual-phase framework for
long-tailed classification that mitigates distributional bias through
high-fidelity data synthesis while avoiding overuse that corrupts holistic
performance. The framework incorporates a reinforcement learning-driven
adaptive sampler, dynamically calibrating synthetic-real data ratios by
training a strategic multi-agent to compensate for scarcities of real data
while ensuring stable discriminative capability. Furthermore, our
class-controllable synthetic network integrates a sketch-grounded perception
branch that harnesses anatomical priors to maintain distinctive class features
while enabling annotation-free inference. Extensive experiments on an in-house
long-tailed and a public imbalanced breast US datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves promising performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD检测性能受限于单一分类器的能力，因此需要一种更灵活的方法来提升检测效果。

Method: 通过异构集成（封闭世界分类器、零样本CLIP分类器和线性探针分类器）进行OOD检测。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet等基准测试中，COOkeD实现了最先进的性能和更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: COOkeD是一种简单但高效的OOD检测方法，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important building block in
trustworthy image recognition systems as unknown classes may arise at
test-time. OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier,
leading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised
setting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot
setting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching
challenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by
the classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we
show that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD
detection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD
combines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a
specific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier
trained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is
modular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus
introduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier.
We evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also
consider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label
noise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been
previously overlooked. Despite its simplicity, COOkeD achieves state-of-the-art
performance and greater robustness compared to both classical and CLIP-based
OOD detection methods. Code is available at https://github.com/glhr/COOkeD

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has proven its effectiveness in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models. Recent research efforts have
progressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the
inherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic
content and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable
performance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these
limitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model
trained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning
(PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of
gradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning
abilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically
adjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a
dynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively
regulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing
reasoning efficiency with correctness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that VL-Cogito consistently matches or surpasses existing reasoning-oriented
models across mainstream multimodal benchmarks spanning mathematics, science,
logic, and general understanding, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a deepfake detection algorithm specifically
designed for electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) systems. To ensure the
reliability of eKYC systems against deepfake attacks, it is essential to
develop a robust deepfake detector capable of identifying both face swapping
and face reenactment, while also being robust to image degradation. We address
these challenges through three key contributions: (1)~Our approach evaluates
the video's authenticity by detecting temporal inconsistencies in identity
vectors extracted by face recognition models, leading to comprehensive
detection of both face swapping and face reenactment. (2)~In addition to
processing video input, the algorithm utilizes a registered image (assumed to
be genuine) to calculate identity discrepancies between the input video and the
registered image, significantly improving detection accuracy. (3)~We find that
employing a face feature extractor trained on a larger dataset enhances both
detection performance and robustness against image degradation. Our
experimental results show that our proposed method accurately detects both face
swapping and face reenactment comprehensively and is robust against various
forms of unseen image degradation. Our source code is publicly available

Conclusion: ShortFT是一种高效微调策略，适用于多种奖励函数，效果显著。

Abstract: Backpropagation-based approaches aim to align diffusion models with reward
functions through end-to-end backpropagation of the reward gradient within the
denoising chain, offering a promising perspective. However, due to the
computational costs and the risk of gradient explosion associated with the
lengthy denoising chain, existing approaches struggle to achieve complete
gradient backpropagation, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we
introduce Shortcut-based Fine-Tuning (ShortFT), an efficient fine-tuning
strategy that utilizes the shorter denoising chain. More specifically, we
employ the recently researched trajectory-preserving few-step diffusion model,
which enables a shortcut over the original denoising chain, and construct a
shortcut-based denoising chain of shorter length. The optimization on this
chain notably enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of fine-tuning the
foundational model. Our method has been rigorously tested and can be
effectively applied to various reward functions, significantly improving
alignment performance and surpassing state-of-the-art alternatives.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动的轨迹预测在长尾场景中表现不佳，现有方法多通过修改模型结构解决，本文提出改进训练过程以释放模型潜力。

Method: 引入GALTraj方法，利用可控扩散模型主动识别并增强训练中的长尾样本，设计尾部感知生成方法以生成多样且符合交通规则的轨迹。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上验证，GALTraj显著提升长尾样本性能，同时提高头部样本准确率。

Conclusion: GALTraj首次将生成式主动学习应用于轨迹预测，有效解决长尾问题，为领域提供新思路。

Abstract: While data-driven trajectory prediction has enhanced the reliability of
autonomous driving systems, it still struggles with rarely observed long-tail
scenarios. Prior works addressed this by modifying model architectures, such as
using hypernetworks. In contrast, we propose refining the training process to
unlock each model's potential without altering its structure. We introduce
Generative Active Learning for Trajectory prediction (GALTraj), the first
method to successfully deploy generative active learning into trajectory
prediction. It actively identifies rare tail samples where the model fails and
augments these samples with a controllable diffusion model during training. In
our framework, generating scenarios that are diverse, realistic, and preserve
tail-case characteristics is paramount. Accordingly, we design a tail-aware
generation method that applies tailored diffusion guidance to generate
trajectories that both capture rare behaviors and respect traffic rules. Unlike
prior simulation methods focused solely on scenario diversity, GALTraj is the
first to show how simulator-driven augmentation benefits long-tail learning in
trajectory prediction. Experiments on multiple trajectory datasets (WOMD,
Argoverse2) with popular backbones (QCNet, MTR) confirm that our method
significantly boosts performance on tail samples and also enhances accuracy on
head samples.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable brain tumor segmentation, particularly when dealing
with missing modalities, remains a critical challenge in medical image
analysis. Previous studies have not fully resolved the challenges of tumor
boundary segmentation insensitivity and feature transfer in the absence of key
imaging modalities. In this study, we introduce MST-KDNet, aimed at addressing
these critical issues. Our model features Multi-Scale Transformer Knowledge
Distillation to effectively capture attention weights at various resolutions,
Dual-Mode Logit Distillation to improve the transfer of knowledge, and a Global
Style Matching Module that integrates feature matching with adversarial
learning. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the BraTS and FeTS 2024
datasets demonstrate that MST-KDNet surpasses current leading methods in both
Dice and HD95 scores, particularly in conditions with substantial modality
loss. Our approach shows exceptional robustness and generalization potential,
making it a promising candidate for real-world clinical applications. Our

Result: LOTS在全局与局部指标上均达到最优性能，并展示了前所未有的设计定制能力。

Conclusion: LOTS为时尚图像生成提供了高效且灵活的解决方案，支持高度定制化设计。

Abstract: Fashion design is a complex creative process that blends visual and textual
expressions. Designers convey ideas through sketches, which define spatial
structure and design elements, and textual descriptions, capturing material,
texture, and stylistic details. In this paper, we present LOcalized Text and
Sketch for fashion image generation (LOTS), an approach for compositional
sketch-text based generation of complete fashion outlooks. LOTS leverages a
global description with paired localized sketch + text information for
conditioning and introduces a novel step-based merging strategy for diffusion
adaptation. First, a Modularized Pair-Centric representation encodes sketches
and text into a shared latent space while preserving independent localized
features; then, a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase integrates both local and
global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's
multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we build on Fashionpedia
to release Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs
are provided per image. Quantitative results show LOTS achieves
state-of-the-art image generation performance on both global and localized
metrics, while qualitative examples and a human evaluation study highlight its
unprecedented level of design customization.

Abstract: Leaf wetness detection is a crucial task in agricultural monitoring, as it
directly impacts the prediction and protection of plant diseases. However,
existing sensing systems suffer from limitations in robustness, accuracy, and
environmental resilience when applied to natural leaves under dynamic

images collected over six months from five diverse plant species in both
controlled and outdoor field environments. We provide detailed benchmarks using
the Hydra model, including comparisons against single modality baselines and
multiple fusion strategies, as well as performance under varying scan

Abstract: The proliferation of drones in civilian airspace has raised urgent security
concerns, necessitating robust real-time surveillance systems. In response to
the 2025 VIP Cup challenge tasks - drone detection, tracking, and payload
identification - we propose a dual-stream drone monitoring framework. Our
approach deploys independent You Only Look Once v11-nano (YOLOv11n) object
detectors on parallel infrared (thermal) and visible (RGB) data streams,
deliberately avoiding early fusion. This separation allows each model to be
specifically optimized for the distinct characteristics of its input modality,
addressing the unique challenges posed by small aerial objects in diverse
environmental conditions. We customize data preprocessing and augmentation
strategies per domain - such as limiting color jitter for IR imagery - and
fine-tune training hyperparameters to enhance detection performance under
conditions of heavy noise, low light, and motion blur. The resulting
lightweight YOLOv11n models demonstrate high accuracy in distinguishing drones
from birds and in classifying payload types, all while maintaining real-time
performance. This report details the rationale for a dual-modality design, the
specialized training pipelines, and the architectural optimizations that
collectively enable efficient and accurate drone surveillance across RGB and IR
channels.

Conclusion: 通过全局结构依赖的数据增强能有效提升3D点云分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: 3D point cloud segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to individual
points in a scene for fine-grained spatial understanding. Existing methods
typically adopt data augmentation to alleviate the burden of large-scale
annotation. However, most augmentation strategies only focus on local
transformations or semantic recomposition, lacking the consideration of global
structural dependencies within scenes. To address this limitation, we propose a
graph-guided data augmentation framework with dual-level constraints for
realistic 3D scene synthesis. Our method learns object relationship statistics
from real-world data to construct guiding graphs for scene generation.
Local-level constraints enforce geometric plausibility and semantic consistency
between objects, while global-level constraints maintain the topological
structure of the scene by aligning the generated layout with the guiding graph.
Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our
framework generates diverse and high-quality augmented scenes, leading to
consistent improvements in point cloud segmentation performance across various
models.

Abstract: Accurate fetal biometric measurements, such as abdominal circumference, play
a vital role in prenatal care. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound
images for these measurements heavily depends on the expertise of sonographers,
posing a significant challenge in low-income countries due to the scarcity of
trained personnel. To address this issue, we leverage FetalCLIP, a
vision-language model pretrained on a curated dataset of over 210,000 fetal
ultrasound image-caption pairs, to perform automated fetal ultrasound image
quality assessment (IQA) on blind-sweep ultrasound data. We introduce
FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$, an IQA model adapted from FetalCLIP using Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), and evaluate it on the ACOUSLIC-AI dataset against six CNN
and Transformer baselines. FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$ achieves the highest F1 score of
0.757. Moreover, we show that an adapted segmentation model, when repurposed
for classification, further improves performance, achieving an F1 score of
0.771. Our work demonstrates how parameter-efficient fine-tuning of fetal
ultrasound foundation models can enable task-specific adaptations, advancing
prenatal care in resource-limited settings. The experimental code is available

Motivation: 现有视觉大语言模型（VLLMs）在训练和推理成本高、跨模态信息融合困难以及视觉细节提取不足等方面存在问题。

Method: MoCHA整合了CLIP、SigLIP、DINOv2和ConvNeXt四种视觉骨干网络，采用MoECs模块动态选择专家，并通过HGA模块优化视觉特征编码。

Result: MoCHA在多个基准测试中表现优异，例如在POPE任务上提升3.25%，在MME任务上提升153分，超越了现有开放权重模型。

Conclusion: MoCHA通过MoECs和HGA模块有效提升了性能，证明了其在高成本和多模态挑战下的优越性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision large language models (VLLMs) are focusing primarily on handling
complex and fine-grained visual information by incorporating advanced vision
encoders and scaling up visual models. However, these approaches face high
training and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual
details, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a
novel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework
integrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to
extract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of
Experts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to
different visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the
visual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a
Hierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and
an adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two
mainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance
across various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art
open-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo
(Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate
hallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual
instructions by raising 153 points on MME. Finally, ablation studies further
confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MoECs and HGA in
improving the overall performance of MoCHA.

TL;DR: CapRecover是一种跨模态反演框架，直接从中间特征恢复高级语义内容（如标签或描述），避免图像重建，解决了视觉语言模型中的语义信息泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在分割DNN配置中的部署增加，用户设备上的视觉编码器（如ResNet、ViT）向云端发送中间特征，导致语义信息泄露风险上升。现有方法重建的图像模糊且语义模糊，无法直接解决语义泄露问题。

Method: 提出CapRecover框架，直接从中间特征恢复高级语义内容（如标签或描述），无需图像重建。进一步分析卷积层深度对语义信息编码的影响，并提出一种简单的保护方法：在每层中间特征添加随机噪声，并在下一层去除噪声。

Result: CapRecover在CIFAR-10上达到92.71%的Top-1标签准确率，在COCO2017上从ResNet50特征生成流畅描述，ROUGE-L得分达0.52。保护方法有效防止语义泄露，且无需额外训练成本。

Conclusion: CapRecover能高效恢复语义内容，揭示了卷积层深度与语义信息编码的关系，提出的保护方法简单有效，为隐私保护提供了新思路。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in split-DNN
configurations--with visual encoders (e.g., ResNet, ViT) operating on user
devices and sending intermediate features to the cloud--there is a growing
privacy risk from semantic information leakage. Existing approaches to
reconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry,
semantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose
CapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level
semantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate
features without image reconstruction.
  We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating
strong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up
to 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from
ResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis
further reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more
semantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage,
we introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to
intermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer.
Experimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without
additional training costs.

Conclusion: 扩散模型作为生成基础模型在异常检测中具有强大潜力，未来可进一步优化。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is pivotal for deploying safe
vision systems in open-world environments. We revisit diffusion models, not as
generators, but as universal perceptual templates for OOD detection. This
research explores the use of score-based generative models as foundational
tools for semantic anomaly detection across unseen datasets. Specifically, we
leverage the denoising trajectories of Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) as a
rich source of texture and semantic information. By analyzing Stein score
errors, amplified through the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), we
introduce a novel method for identifying anomalous samples without requiring
re-training on each target dataset. Our approach improves over state-of-the-art
and relies on training a single model on one dataset -- CelebA -- which we find
to be an effective base distribution, even outperforming more commonly used
datasets like ImageNet in several settings. Experimental results show
near-perfect performance on some benchmarks, with notable headroom on others,
highlighting both the strength and future potential of generative foundation
models in anomaly detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SfT方法依赖点对应关系，在严重遮挡时性能下降；现代方法虽无需对应关系，但需要大量监督数据。本文旨在开发一种无监督方法，仅需图像观测即可高效重建。

Method: 结合颜色特征、梯度和轮廓等图像观测，以及网格不可扩展约束，实现无监督3D形状重建。

Result: 方法比现有最佳无监督SfT快400倍，且在细节生成和遮挡处理上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的无监督SfT方法高效且鲁棒，适用于复杂场景下的3D重建。

Abstract: Shape-from-Template (SfT) refers to the class of methods that reconstruct the
3D shape of a deforming object from images/videos using a 3D template.
Traditional SfT methods require point correspondences between images and the
texture of the 3D template in order to reconstruct 3D shapes from images/videos
in real time. Their performance severely degrades when encountered with severe
occlusions in the images because of the unavailability of correspondences. In
contrast, modern SfT methods use a correspondence-free approach by
incorporating deep neural networks to reconstruct 3D objects, thus requiring
huge amounts of data for supervision. Recent advances use a fully unsupervised
or self-supervised approach by combining differentiable physics and graphics to
deform 3D template to match input images. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised SfT which uses only image observations: color features, gradients
and silhouettes along with a mesh inextensibility constraint to reconstruct at
a $400\times$ faster pace than (best-performing) unsupervised SfT. Moreover,
when it comes to generating finer details and severe occlusions, our method
outperforms the existing methodologies by a large margin. Code is available at

Abstract: Structure and continuous motion estimation from point correspondences is a
fundamental problem in computer vision that has been powered by well-known
algorithms such as the familiar 5-point or 8-point algorithm. However, despite
their acclaim, these algorithms are limited to processing point correspondences
originating from a pair of views each one representing an instantaneous capture
of the scene. Yet, in the case of rolling shutter cameras, or more recently,
event cameras, this synchronization breaks down. In this work, we present a
unified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point
correspondences with arbitrary timestamps, from an arbitrary set of views. By
formulating the problem in terms of first-order dynamics and leveraging a
constant velocity motion model, we derive a novel, linear point incidence
relation allowing for the efficient recovery of both linear velocity and 3D
points with predictable degeneracies and solution multiplicities. Owing to its
general formulation, it can handle correspondences from a wide range of sensing
modalities such as global shutter, rolling shutter, and event cameras, and can
even combine correspondences from different collocated sensors. We validate the
effectiveness of our solver on both simulated and real-world data, where we
show consistent improvement across all modalities when compared to recent
approaches. We believe our work opens the door to efficient structure and
motion estimation from asynchronous data. Code can be found at

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is one of the most crucial tasks for
autonomous driving, ensuring its safety. Yet, existing models often fail to
fully leverage the visual cues that humans subconsciously communicate when
navigating the space. In this work, we study the benefits of predicting human
trajectories using human body poses instead of solely their Cartesian space
locations in time. We propose `Social-pose', an attention-based pose encoder
that effectively captures the poses of all humans in a scene and their social
relations. Our method can be integrated into various trajectory prediction
architectures. We have conducted extensive experiments on state-of-the-art
models (based on LSTM, GAN, MLP, and Transformer), and showed improvements over
all of them on synthetic (Joint Track Auto) and real (Human3.6M, Pedestrians
and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and JRDB) datasets. We also explored the
advantages of using 2D versus 3D poses, as well as the effect of noisy poses
and the application of our pose-based predictor in robot navigation scenarios.

Abstract: Advances in Generative AI have made video-level deepfake detection
increasingly challenging, exposing the limitations of current detection
techniques. In this paper, we present HOLA, our solution to the Video-Level
Deepfake Detection track of 2025 1M-Deepfakes Detection Challenge. Inspired by
the success of large-scale pre-training in the general domain, we first scale
audio-visual self-supervised pre-training in the multimodal video-level
deepfake detection, which leverages our self-built dataset of 1.81M samples,
thereby leading to a unified two-stage framework. To be specific, HOLA features
an iterative-aware cross-modal learning module for selective audio-visual
interactions, hierarchical contextual modeling with gated aggregations under
the local-global perspective, and a pyramid-like refiner for scale-aware
cross-grained semantic enhancements. Moreover, we propose the pseudo supervised
singal injection strategy to further boost model performance. Extensive
experiments across expert models and MLLMs impressivly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed HOLA. We also conduct a series of ablation
studies to explore the crucial design factors of our introduced components.
Remarkably, our HOLA ranks 1st, outperforming the second by 0.0476 AUC on the
TestA set.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 特征匹配是计算机视觉中的核心任务，但传统方法在模态差异较大时表现不佳，深度学习技术提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 综述了传统手工方法（如Harris、SIFT、ORB）和深度学习方法（如SuperPoint、LoFTR），并探讨了针对不同模态的专用技术。

Result: 深度学习显著提升了跨模态特征匹配的鲁棒性和适应性，尤其是在深度图像、3D点云、LiDAR扫描和医学图像等领域。

Abstract: Feature matching is a cornerstone task in computer vision, essential for
applications such as image retrieval, stereo matching, 3D reconstruction, and
SLAM. This survey comprehensively reviews modality-based feature matching,
exploring traditional handcrafted methods and emphasizing contemporary deep
learning approaches across various modalities, including RGB images, depth
images, 3D point clouds, LiDAR scans, medical images, and vision-language
interactions. Traditional methods, leveraging detectors like Harris corners and
descriptors such as SIFT and ORB, demonstrate robustness under moderate
intra-modality variations but struggle with significant modality gaps.
Contemporary deep learning-based methods, exemplified by detector-free
strategies like CNN-based SuperPoint and transformer-based LoFTR, substantially
improve robustness and adaptability across modalities. We highlight
modality-aware advancements, such as geometric and depth-specific descriptors
for depth images, sparse and dense learning methods for 3D point clouds,
attention-enhanced neural networks for LiDAR scans, and specialized solutions
like the MIND descriptor for complex medical image matching. Cross-modal
applications, particularly in medical image registration and vision-language
tasks, underscore the evolution of feature matching to handle increasingly
diverse data interactions.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation and Tracking (VOST) presents a complex yet critical
challenge in computer vision, requiring robust integration of segmentation and
tracking across temporally dynamic frames. Traditional methods have struggled
with domain generalization, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency.
The emergence of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and
its successor, SAM2, has introduced a paradigm shift, enabling prompt-driven
segmentation with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon these
advances, this survey provides a comprehensive review of SAM/SAM2-based methods
for VOST, structured along three temporal dimensions: past, present, and
future. We examine strategies for retaining and updating historical information
(past), approaches for extracting and optimizing discriminative features from
the current frame (present), and motion prediction and trajectory estimation
mechanisms for anticipating object dynamics in subsequent frames (future). In
doing so, we highlight the evolution from early memory-based architectures to
the streaming memory and real-time segmentation capabilities of SAM2. We also
discuss recent innovations such as motion-aware memory selection and
trajectory-guided prompting, which aim to enhance both accuracy and efficiency.
Finally, we identify remaining challenges including memory redundancy, error
accumulation, and prompt inefficiency, and suggest promising directions for
future research. This survey offers a timely and structured overview of the
field, aiming to guide researchers and practitioners in advancing the state of
VOST through the lens of foundation models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据无关、零样本的触发器反演策略DISTIL，通过扩散生成器重构触发器，显著提升后门防御效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络易受后门攻击，现有触发器反演方法存在局限性，缺乏对触发器真实性的保证。

Method: 利用扩散生成器在受限搜索空间内生成候选触发器，结合目标分类器指导，避免对触发器外观的强假设。

Result: DISTIL在BackdoorBench数据集上准确率提升7.1%，在特洛伊目标检测模型扫描中提升9.4%。

Conclusion: DISTIL为无需大量数据或强先验假设的后门防御提供了新方向。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success across numerous
tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to Trojan (backdoor) attacks, raising serious
concerns about their safety in real-world mission-critical applications. A
common countermeasure is trigger inversion -- reconstructing malicious
"shortcut" patterns (triggers) inserted by an adversary during training.
Current trigger-inversion methods typically search the full pixel space under
specific assumptions but offer no assurances that the estimated trigger is more
than an adversarial perturbation that flips the model output. Here, we propose
a data-free, zero-shot trigger-inversion strategy that restricts the search
space while avoiding strong assumptions on trigger appearance. Specifically, we
incorporate a diffusion-based generator guided by the target classifier;
through iterative generation, we produce candidate triggers that align with the
internal representations the model relies on for malicious behavior. Empirical
evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, show that our approach
reconstructs triggers that effectively distinguish clean versus Trojaned
models. DISTIL surpasses alternative methods by high margins, achieving up to
7.1% higher accuracy on the BackdoorBench dataset and a 9.4% improvement on
trojaned object detection model scanning, offering a promising new direction
for reliable backdoor defense without reliance on extensive data or strong
prior assumptions about triggers. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的计算流体动力学（CFD）模拟耗时且计算量大，几何深度学习方法可以快速估计血流动力学参数，为临床实践提供高效工具。

Method: 使用E(3)-等变深度学习模型，结合新型鲁棒几何描述符和投影几何代数，训练模型估计瞬态壁剪切应力（WSS）。数据集包括100名AAA患者的CT扫描和参考CFD模拟。

Result: 模型在分布内和外部测试集上均表现良好，能够适应几何重构和边界条件变化，且对新分支和网格分辨率具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该模型在血流动力学参数估计中具有高准确性和泛化能力，有望在临床中广泛应用。

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are pathologic dilatations of the abdominal
aorta posing a high fatality risk upon rupture. Studying AAA progression and
rupture risk often involves in-silico blood flow modelling with computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) and extraction of hemodynamic factors like time-averaged
wall shear stress (TAWSS) or oscillatory shear index (OSI). However, CFD
simulations are known to be computationally demanding. Hence, in recent years,
geometric deep learning methods, operating directly on 3D shapes, have been
proposed as compelling surrogates, estimating hemodynamic parameters in just a
few seconds. In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to
estimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to
common factors of real-world variation. We propose an E(3)-equivariant deep
learning model utilising novel robust geometrical descriptors and projective
geometric algebra. Our model is trained to estimate transient WSS using a
dataset of CT scans of 100 AAA patients, from which lumen geometries are
extracted and reference CFD simulations with varying boundary conditions are
obtained. Results show that the model generalizes well within the distribution,
as well as to the external test set. Moreover, the model can accurately
estimate hemodynamics across geometry remodelling and changes in boundary
conditions. Furthermore, we find that a trained model can be applied to
different artery tree topologies, where new and unseen branches are added
during inference. Finally, we find that the model is to a large extent agnostic
to mesh resolution. These results show the accuracy and generalisation of the
proposed model, and highlight its potential to contribute to hemodynamic
parameter estimation in clinical practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双层优化的自监督方法，用于检测AI生成的人脸，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于监督学习的AI人脸检测器依赖于特定生成器合成的图像，难以泛化到新兴生成技术。

Method: 通过双层优化：内层使用线性加权的预训练任务（分类、排序和检测）训练视觉编码器；外层优化任务权重以提升检测能力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在一类和二分类任务中均显著优于现有方法，且对未见生成器具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自监督学习有效解决了AI生成人脸检测的泛化问题。

Abstract: AI-generated face detectors trained via supervised learning typically rely on
synthesized images from specific generators, limiting their generalization to
emerging generative techniques. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
self-supervised method based on bi-level optimization. In the inner loop, we
pretrain a vision encoder only on photographic face images using a set of
linearly weighted pretext tasks: classification of categorical exchangeable
image file format (EXIF) tags, ranking of ordinal EXIF tags, and detection of
artificial face manipulations. The outer loop then optimizes the relative
weights of these pretext tasks to enhance the coarse-grained detection of
manipulated faces, serving as a proxy task for identifying AI-generated faces.
In doing so, it aligns self-supervised learning more closely with the ultimate
goal of AI-generated face detection. Once pretrained, the encoder remains
fixed, and AI-generated faces are detected either as anomalies under a Gaussian
mixture model fitted to photographic face features or by a lightweight
two-layer perceptron serving as a binary classifier. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our detectors significantly outperform existing approaches in
both one-class and binary classification settings, exhibiting strong
generalization to unseen generators.

TL;DR: DepR是一种基于深度的单视角场景重建框架，通过实例级扩散和组合范式实现高效重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在推理阶段仅利用深度信息进行对象布局估计，未能充分利用其几何信息。DepR旨在通过深度信息在训练和推理中的全面应用，提升重建效果。

Method: DepR采用深度引导的扩散模型，在训练中编码形状先验，推理中通过深度引导DDIM采样和布局优化。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，DepR表现出色，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DepR通过深度信息的全面利用，显著提升了单视角场景重建的效果和泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose DepR, a depth-guided single-view scene reconstruction framework
that integrates instance-level diffusion within a compositional paradigm.
Instead of reconstructing the entire scene holistically, DepR generates
individual objects and subsequently composes them into a coherent 3D layout.
Unlike previous methods that use depth solely for object layout estimation
during inference and therefore fail to fully exploit its rich geometric
information, DepR leverages depth throughout both training and inference.
Specifically, we introduce depth-guided conditioning to effectively encode
shape priors into diffusion models. During inference, depth further guides DDIM
sampling and layout optimization, enhancing alignment between the
reconstruction and the input image. Despite being trained on limited synthetic
data, DepR achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong
generalization in single-view scene reconstruction, as shown through
evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化多智能体框架，通过三个阶段（基础、规划和生成）将UI设计转化为前端代码，提高了鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖自然语言提示，难以捕捉空间布局和视觉设计意图，而实际UI开发是多模态的。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型检测UI组件，构建层次化布局，并通过自适应提示生成HTML/CSS代码。

Result: 在布局准确性、结构连贯性和代码正确性上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了UI理解和代码质量，代码已开源。

Abstract: Automating the transformation of user interface (UI) designs into front-end
code holds significant promise for accelerating software development and
democratizing design workflows. While recent large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely
solely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing
spatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in
practice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or
mockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that
performs UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding,
planning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to
detect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical
layout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces
HTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves
robustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods.
Furthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that
automatically produces large-scale image-code pairs. Using these synthetic
examples, we fine-tune and reinforce an open-source VLM, yielding notable gains
in UI understanding and code quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy,
structural coherence, and code correctness. Our code is made publicly available
at https://github.com/leigest519/ScreenCoder.

Result: 在FGVC和VTAB-1k基准测试中，性能分别超过全微调3.40%和10.35%。

Conclusion: TR-PTS通过任务驱动的参数和令牌选择，实现了计算效率和性能的双重提升。

Abstract: Large pre-trained models achieve remarkable performance in vision tasks but
are impractical for fine-tuning due to high computational and storage costs.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate this issue by updating
only a subset of parameters; however, most existing approaches are
task-agnostic, failing to fully exploit task-specific adaptations, which leads
to suboptimal efficiency and performance. To address this limitation, we
propose Task-Relevant Parameter and Token Selection (TR-PTS), a task-driven
framework that enhances both computational efficiency and accuracy.
Specifically, we introduce Task-Relevant Parameter Selection, which utilizes
the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to identify and fine-tune only the most
informative parameters in a layer-wise manner, while keeping the remaining
parameters frozen. Simultaneously, Task-Relevant Token Selection dynamically
preserves the most informative tokens and merges redundant ones, reducing
computational overhead. By jointly optimizing parameters and tokens, TR-PTS
enables the model to concentrate on task-discriminative information. We
evaluate TR-PTS on benchmark, including FGVC and VTAB-1k, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing full fine-tuning by 3.40% and 10.35%,
respectively. The code are available at https://github.com/synbol/TR-PTS.

Conclusion: LCS展示了ESR模型在资源受限设备上进行图像放大的潜力。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of content rendering in modern games has led to a
problematic growth in the workload of the GPU. In this paper, we propose an
AI-based low-complexity scaler (LCS) inspired by state-of-the-art efficient
super-resolution (ESR) models which could offload the workload on the GPU to a
low-power device such as a neural processing unit (NPU). The LCS is trained on
GameIR image pairs natively rendered at low and high resolution. We utilize
adversarial training to encourage reconstruction of perceptually important
details, and apply reparameterization and quantization techniques to reduce
model complexity and size. In our comparative analysis we evaluate the LCS
alongside the publicly available AMD hardware-based Edge Adaptive Scaling
Function (EASF) and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1 (FSR1) on five different
metrics, and find that the LCS achieves better perceptual quality,
demonstrating the potential of ESR models for upscaling on resource-constrained
devices.

Abstract: Referring audio-visual segmentation (RAVS) has recently seen significant

deeply understanding and reasoning about audiovisual content. To extend the
boundaries of RAVS and facilitate future research in this field, we propose
Omnimodal Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (OmniAVS), a new dataset

stands out with three key innovations: (1) 8 types of multimodal expressions
that flexibly combine text, speech, sound, and visual cues; (2) an emphasis on
understanding audio content beyond just detecting their presence; and (3) the
inclusion of complex reasoning and world knowledge in expressions. Furthermore,
we introduce Omnimodal Instructed Segmentation Assistant (OISA), to address the
challenges of multimodal reasoning and fine-grained understanding of
audiovisual content in OmniAVS. OISA uses MLLM to comprehend complex cues and
perform reasoning-based segmentation. Extensive experiments show that OISA
outperforms existing methods on OmniAVS and achieves competitive results on

TL;DR: 当前的大语言模型（LLM）评估基准缺乏写作风格多样性，可能导致模型在非标准输入下表现脆弱。本研究通过基于角色的提示重写方法，发现写作风格和提示格式对LLM性能有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准的写作风格单一，无法全面反映人类沟通的多样性，可能导致LLM在非标准输入下表现不佳。

Method: 使用基于角色的LLM提示重写方法，模拟多样化的写作风格，测试其对LLM性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现，即使语义内容相同，写作风格和提示格式的变化会显著影响LLM的性能评估。某些风格会一致触发低或高性能。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了一种可扩展的方法，增强现有基准的外部有效性，以更全面地评估LLM在语言变体中的表现。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often do not
exhibit enough writing style diversity, with many adhering primarily to
standardized conventions. Such benchmarks do not fully capture the rich variety
of communication patterns exhibited by humans. Thus, it is possible that LLMs,
which are optimized on these benchmarks, may demonstrate brittle performance
when faced with "non-standard" input. In this work, we test this hypothesis by
rewriting evaluation prompts using persona-based LLM prompting, a low-cost
method to emulate diverse writing styles. Our results show that, even with
identical semantic content, variations in writing style and prompt formatting
significantly impact the estimated performance of the LLM under evaluation.
Notably, we identify distinct writing styles that consistently trigger either
low or high performance across a range of models and tasks, irrespective of
model family, size, and recency. Our work offers a scalable approach to augment
existing benchmarks, improving the external validity of the assessments they
provide for measuring LLM performance across linguistic variations.

Motivation: 现有工具在规模、准确性或可访问性上有限，无法满足对动词框架频率的高效分析需求。

Method: 使用LLM生成包含476个英语动词的句子语料库，并指导LLM像语言学家一样分析句法结构。

Result: 该流程在多个评估数据集上优于两种广泛使用的句法分析器，且资源消耗远低于手动分析。

Conclusion: 该研究为自动化框架频率估计提供了概念验证，并发布了代码和数据以支持未来研究。

Abstract: We present an automated pipeline for estimating Verb Frame Frequencies
(VFFs), the frequency with which a verb appears in particular syntactic frames.
VFFs provide a powerful window into syntax in both human and machine language
systems, but existing tools for calculating them are limited in scale,
accuracy, or accessibility. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate a
corpus of sentences containing 476 English verbs. Next, by instructing an LLM
to behave like an expert linguist, we had it analyze the syntactic structure of
the sentences in this corpus. This pipeline outperforms two widely used
syntactic parsers across multiple evaluation datasets. Furthermore, it requires
far fewer resources than manual parsing (the gold-standard), thereby enabling
rapid, scalable VFF estimation. Using the LLM parser, we produce a new VFF
database with broader verb coverage, finer-grained syntactic distinctions, and
explicit estimates of the relative frequencies of structural alternates
commonly studied in psycholinguistics. The pipeline is easily customizable and
extensible to new verbs, syntactic frames, and even other languages. We present
this work as a proof of concept for automated frame frequency estimation, and
release all code and data to support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究过于关注媒体曝光度，而忽略了媒体内容对风险投资决策的细微影响。

Method: 使用197家英国微纳米技术初创企业（1995-2004年）的数据，分析媒体记忆性与投资结果的关系。

Result: 媒体记忆性显著影响投资结果，风险投资者更关注初创企业的独特性和语义网络连接性。

Conclusion: 初创企业应通过更有针对性的媒体报道提升品牌记忆性，而不仅是增加曝光频率。

Abstract: Media reputation plays an important role in attracting venture capital
investment. However, prior research has focused too narrowly on general media
exposure, limiting our understanding of how media truly influences funding
decisions. As informed decision-makers, venture capitalists respond to more
nuanced aspects of media content. We introduce the concept of media
memorability - the media's ability to imprint a startup's name in the memory of
relevant investors. Using data from 197 UK startups in the micro and
nanotechnology sector (funded between 1995 and 2004), we show that media
memorability significantly influences investment outcomes. Our findings suggest
that venture capitalists rely on detailed cues such as a startup's
distinctiveness and connectivity within news semantic networks. This
contributes to research on entrepreneurial finance and media legitimation. In

### [74] [How Well Does First-Token Entropy Approximate Word Entropy as a Psycholinguistic Predictor?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22209)
*Christian Clark,Byung-Doh Oh,William Schuler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，基于语言模型的首子词标记估计的上下文熵会低估和扭曲真实词熵，蒙特卡洛估计方法能更准确地反映词熵，且对阅读时间的影响与首子词标记估计结果不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨上下文熵作为心理语言学指标的准确性，尤其是首子词标记估计方法的局限性。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛方法估计词熵，允许词跨越多个子词标记，并与首子词标记估计方法进行比较。

Result: 蒙特卡洛估计与首子词标记估计在阅读时间回归实验中表现出不同结果。

Conclusion: 需要谨慎使用首子词标记近似估计上下文熵，蒙特卡洛方法提供了更准确的替代方案。

Abstract: Contextual entropy is a psycholinguistic measure capturing the anticipated
difficulty of processing a word just before it is encountered. Recent studies
have tested for entropy-related effects as a potential complement to well-known
effects from surprisal. For convenience, entropy is typically estimated based
on a language model's probability distribution over a word's first subword
token. However, this approximation results in underestimation and potential
distortion of true word entropy. To address this, we generate Monte Carlo (MC)
estimates of word entropy that allow words to span a variable number of tokens.
Regression experiments on reading times show divergent results between
first-token and MC word entropy, suggesting a need for caution in using
first-token approximations of contextual entropy.

*Dongyub Jude Lee,Zhenyi Ye,Pengcheng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLfR是一种新的机器翻译偏好学习框架，通过外部教师模型（GPT-4o）提供连续反馈，替代静态三元组数据，显著提升翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法依赖静态三元组数据且泛化能力有限，RLfR旨在通过动态反馈解决这一问题。

Method: RLfR将翻译步骤视为微教程，演员生成假设，教师模型优化并提供反馈，演员通过负编辑距离和COMET分数逐步学习。

Result: 在FLORES-200基准测试中，RLfR在语义准确性和实体保留方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RLfR通过动态反馈和渐进学习，显著提升了机器翻译的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Preference-learning methods for machine translation (MT)--such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)--have achieved impressive gains but depend
heavily on large, carefully curated triplet datasets and often struggle to
generalize beyond their tuning domains. We propose Reinforcement Learning from
Teacher-Model Refinement (RLfR), a novel framework that removes reliance on
static triplets by leveraging continuous, high-quality feedback from an
external teacher model (GPT-4o). RLfR frames each translation step as a
micro-tutorial: the actor generates a hypothesis, the teacher refines it, and
the actor is rewarded based on how closely it aligns with the teacher's
refinement. Guided by two complementary signals--(i) negative edit distance,
promoting lexical and structural fidelity, and (ii) COMET score, ensuring
semantic adequacy--the actor progressively learns to emulate the teacher,
mirroring a human learning process through incremental, iterative improvement.
On the FLORES-200 benchmark (English to and from German, Spanish, Chinese,
Korean, and Japanese), RLfR consistently outperforms both MT-SFT and
preference-based baselines, significantly improving COMET (semantic adequacy)
and M-ETA (entity preservation) scores.

TL;DR: 研究表明，大型语言模型（LLMs）的内部表征反映了功能驱动的梯度性，支持了基于使用的构式理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证大型语言模型是否学习到基于功能的梯度性构式表征。

Method: 分析Pythia-1.4B模型中英语双宾和介词宾构式的神经表征，使用5000对句子数据集，测量能量距离和Jensen-Shannon散度。

Result: 构式表征的可分性受梯度偏好强度调节，原型例句在激活空间中占据更独特区域。

Conclusion: LLMs学习了丰富、功能驱动的梯度构式表征，支持几何测量方法验证构式理论。

Abstract: The usage-based constructionist (UCx) approach posits that language comprises
a network of learned form-meaning pairings (constructions) whose use is largely
determined by their meanings or functions, requiring them to be graded and
probabilistic. This study investigates whether the internal representations in
Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect the proposed function-infused gradience.
We analyze the neural representations of the English dative constructions
(Double Object and Prepositional Object) in Pythia-$1.4$B, using a dataset of
$5000$ sentence pairs systematically varied for human-rated preference
strength. A macro-level geometric analysis finds that the separability between
construction representations, as measured by Energy Distance or Jensen-Shannon
Divergence, is systematically modulated by gradient preference strength. More
prototypical exemplars of each construction occupy more distinct regions in the
activation space of LLMs. These results provide strong evidence that LLMs learn
rich, meaning-infused, graded representations of constructions and offer
support for geometric measures of basic constructionist principles in LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统任务导向对话系统需要大量标注数据，而本研究旨在通过结合BERT和LLM的优势，减少数据依赖并提升性能。

Method: 采用混合方法，结合BERT的计算效率和LLM的泛化能力，在零样本和少样本设置下进行意图识别和OOS检测。

Result: 在多方对话语料库上评估，发现BERT输出信息共享给LLM能提升系统性能。

Conclusion: 混合方法在意图识别和OOS检测中表现优越，尤其在数据稀缺场景下。

Abstract: Intent recognition is a fundamental component in task-oriented dialogue
systems (TODS). Determining user intents and detecting whether an intent is
Out-of-Scope (OOS) is crucial for TODS to provide reliable responses. However,
traditional TODS require large amount of annotated data. In this work we
propose a hybrid approach to combine BERT and LLMs in zero and few-shot
settings to recognize intents and detect OOS utterances. Our approach leverages
LLMs generalization power and BERT's computational efficiency in such
scenarios. We evaluate our method on multi-party conversation corpora and
observe that sharing information from BERT outputs to LLMs leads to system
performance improvement.

Conclusion: 提出的方法改进了模型对否定的处理能力，并提供了数据集分析的见解。

Abstract: Understanding and solving complex reasoning tasks is vital for addressing the
information needs of a user. Although dense neural models learn contextualised
embeddings, they still underperform on queries containing negation. To
understand this phenomenon, we study negation in both traditional neural
information retrieval and LLM-based models. We (1) introduce a taxonomy of
negation that derives from philosophical, linguistic, and logical definitions;
(2) generate two benchmark datasets that can be used to evaluate the
performance of neural information retrieval models and to fine-tune models for
a more robust performance on negation; and (3) propose a logic-based
classification mechanism that can be used to analyze the performance of
retrieval models on existing datasets. Our taxonomy produces a balanced data
distribution over negation types, providing a better training setup that leads
to faster convergence on the NevIR dataset. Moreover, we propose a
classification schema that reveals the coverage of negation types in existing
datasets, offering insights into the factors that might affect the
generalization of fine-tuned models on negation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Traits Run Deep的人格评估框架，通过心理学启发的提示和多模态融合技术，显著提升了人格评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人格评估在情感智能、心理健康诊断和个性化教育等领域至关重要，但传统方法难以捕捉跨模态的异步信号。

Method: 采用心理学启发的提示提取高层次人格语义，设计文本为中心的多模态融合网络，包括分块投影器、跨模态连接器和文本特征增强器。

Result: 在AVI验证集上实现了约45%的MSE降低，并在AVI Challenge 2025测试集上排名第一。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态融合和心理学提示显著提升了人格评估的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable personality assessment plays a vital role in many
fields, such as emotional intelligence, mental health diagnostics, and
personalized education. Unlike fleeting emotions, personality traits are
stable, often subconsciously leaked through language, facial expressions, and
body behaviors, with asynchronous patterns across modalities. It was hard to
model personality semantics with traditional superficial features and seemed
impossible to achieve effective cross-modal understanding. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel personality assessment framework called
\textit{\textbf{Traits Run Deep}}. It employs
\textit{\textbf{psychology-informed prompts}} to elicit high-level
personality-relevant semantic representations. Besides, it devises a
\textit{\textbf{Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network}} that anchors rich text
semantics to align and integrate asynchronous signals from other modalities. To
be specific, such fusion module includes a Chunk-Wise Projector to decrease
dimensionality, a Cross-Modal Connector and a Text Feature Enhancer for
effective modality fusion and an ensemble regression head to improve
generalization in data-scarce situations. To our knowledge, we are the first to
apply personality-specific prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in
extracting personality-aware semantics for improved representation quality.
Furthermore, extracting and fusing audio-visual apparent behavior features
further improves the accuracy. Experimental results on the AVI validation set
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed components, i.e.,
approximately a 45\% reduction in mean squared error (MSE). Final evaluations
on the test set of the AVI Challenge 2025 confirm our method's superiority,
ranking first in the Personality Assessment track. The source code will be made
available at https://github.com/MSA-LMC/TraitsRunDeep.

Motivation: 通过LLMs简化繁琐的专利申请流程，实现专利写作的范式转变。

Method: 提出PATENTWRITER框架，评估六种LLMs在零样本、少样本和思维链提示策略下的表现，使用多种指标（如BLEU、ROUGE、BERTScore）和输入扰动测试。

Result: 现代LLMs能生成高质量且风格合适的专利摘要，性能常优于领域特定基线。

Conclusion: PATENTWRITER框架为专利摘要生成提供了可靠评估工具，支持未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative approaches in
several important fields. This paper aims for a paradigm shift for patent
writing by leveraging LLMs to overcome the tedious patent-filing process. In
this work, we present PATENTWRITER, the first unified benchmarking framework
for evaluating LLMs in patent abstract generation. Given the first claim of a
patent, we evaluate six leading LLMs -- including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 -- under a
consistent setup spanning zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting
strategies to generate the abstract of the patent. Our benchmark PATENTWRITER
goes beyond surface-level evaluation: we systematically assess the output
quality using a comprehensive suite of metrics -- standard NLP measures (e.g.,
BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore), robustness under three types of input perturbations,
and applicability in two downstream patent classification and retrieval tasks.
We also conduct stylistic analysis to assess length, readability, and tone.
Experimental results show that modern LLMs can generate high-fidelity and
stylistically appropriate patent abstracts, often surpassing domain-specific
baselines. Our code and dataset are open-sourced to support reproducibility and
future research.

TL;DR: 论文指出NIAH基准可能高估了LLMs的长上下文理解能力，并提出了新基准NeedleChain和改进策略ROPE Contraction。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NIAH基准可能无法准确评估LLMs的长上下文理解能力，因此需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 提出新基准NeedleChain，完全由查询相关信息组成，并引入ROPE Contraction策略。

Result: 实验显示先进LLMs在处理和理解长上下文之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: NeedleChain提供了更全面的评估，ROPE Contraction能有效提升LLMs的长上下文理解能力。

Abstract: The Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) benchmark is widely used to evaluate Large
Language Models' (LLMs) ability to understand long contexts (LC). It evaluates
the capability to identify query-relevant context within extensive
query-irrelevant passages. Although this method serves as a widely accepted
standard for evaluating long-context understanding, our findings suggest it may
overestimate the true LC capability of LLMs. We demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o struggle to intactly incorporate given
contexts made up of solely query-relevant ten sentences. In response, we
introduce a novel benchmark, \textbf{NeedleChain}, where the context consists
entirely of query-relevant information, requiring the LLM to fully grasp the
input to answer correctly. Our benchmark allows for flexible context length and
reasoning order, offering a more comprehensive analysis of LLM performance.
Additionally, we propose an extremely simple yet compelling strategy to improve
LC understanding capability of LLM: ROPE Contraction. Our experiments with
various advanced LLMs reveal a notable disparity between their ability to
process large contexts and their capacity to fully understand them. Source code
and datasets are available at https://github.com/hyeonseokk/NeedleChain

Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否能生成具有文化多样性的故事，揭示AI生成内容的潜在偏见。

Method: 使用GPT-4o-mini为236个国家各生成50个故事，分析其叙事结构和文化元素。

Result: 故事叙事结构单一，偏向小城镇、传统与社区和谐，缺乏现实冲突和多样性。

Conclusion: AI生成内容存在叙事标准化偏见，需在文化对齐和多样性研究中加以关注。

Abstract: Can a language model trained largely on Anglo-American texts generate stories
that are culturally relevant to other nationalities? To find out, we generated
11,800 stories - 50 for each of 236 countries - by sending the prompt "Write a
1500 word potential {demonym} story" to OpenAI's model gpt-4o-mini. Although
the stories do include surface-level national symbols and themes, they
overwhelmingly conform to a single narrative plot structure across countries: a
protagonist lives in or returns home to a small town and resolves a minor
conflict by reconnecting with tradition and organising community events.
Real-world conflicts are sanitised, romance is almost absent, and narrative
tension is downplayed in favour of nostalgia and reconciliation. The result is
a narrative homogenisation: an AI-generated synthetic imaginary that
prioritises stability above change and tradition above growth. We argue that
the structural homogeneity of AI-generated narratives constitutes a distinct
form of AI bias, a narrative standardisation that should be acknowledged
alongside the more familiar representational bias. These findings are relevant
to literary studies, narratology, critical AI studies, NLP research, and
efforts to improve the cultural alignment of generative AI.

Conclusion: Falcon-H1系列在性能、效率和适用性上均领先，且开源发布，推动AI研究普及。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Falcon-H1, a new series of large language models
(LLMs) featuring hybrid architecture designs optimized for both high
performance and efficiency across diverse use cases. Unlike earlier Falcon
models built solely on Transformer or Mamba architectures, Falcon-H1 adopts a
parallel hybrid approach that combines Transformer-based attention with State
Space Models (SSMs), known for superior long-context memory and computational
efficiency. We systematically revisited model design, data strategy, and
training dynamics, challenging conventional practices in the field. Falcon-H1
is released in multiple configurations, including base and instruction-tuned
variants at 0.5B, 1.5B, 1.5B-deep, 3B, 7B, and 34B parameters. Quantized
instruction-tuned models are also available, totaling over 30 checkpoints on
Hugging Face Hub. Falcon-H1 models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and
exceptional parameter and training efficiency. The flagship Falcon-H1-34B
matches or outperforms models up to 70B scale, such as Qwen3-32B, Qwen2.5-72B,
and Llama3.3-70B, while using fewer parameters and less data. Smaller models
show similar trends: the Falcon-H1-1.5B-Deep rivals current leading 7B-10B
models, and Falcon-H1-0.5B performs comparably to typical 7B models from 2024.
These models excel across reasoning, mathematics, multilingual tasks,
instruction following, and scientific knowledge. With support for up to 256K
context tokens and 18 languages, Falcon-H1 is suitable for a wide range of
applications. All models are released under a permissive open-source license,
underscoring our commitment to accessible and impactful AI research.

Motivation: 重新审视LLMs的抽象推理能力，挑战现有观点，探讨其实际表现及意义。

Method: 通过实验比较零样本和微调后的性能，并测试跨数据集的泛化能力。

Result: 零样本表现差，但微调后性能接近完美，但泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 需重新定义“抽象推理者”的标准，并讨论LLMs是否符合这一标准的意义。

Abstract: Recent work has argued that large language models (LLMs) are not "abstract
reasoners", citing their poor zero-shot performance on a variety of challenging
tasks as evidence. We revisit these experiments in order to add nuance to the
claim. First, we show that while LLMs indeed perform poorly in a zero-shot
setting, even tuning a small subset of parameters for input encoding can enable
near-perfect performance. However, we also show that this finetuning does not
necessarily transfer across datasets. We take this collection of empirical
results as an invitation to (re-)open the discussion of what it means to be an
"abstract reasoner", and why it matters whether LLMs fit the bill.

Motivation: 现实应用中，代码生成不仅需要正确性，还需严格遵循编码风格、行数等详细要求。现有方法对此支持不足。

Method: 引入前向和后向约束生成方法，改进Code LLMs的指令遵循能力。提出IFEvalCode基准，包含1.6K测试样本，支持七种编程语言和中英文查询。

Conclusion: 通过约束生成和IFEvalCode基准，论文为Code LLMs的受控代码生成提供了有效方法，并揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Code large language models (Code LLMs) have made significant progress in code
generation by translating natural language descriptions into functional code;
however, real-world applications often demand stricter adherence to detailed
requirements such as coding style, line count, and structural constraints,
beyond mere correctness. To address this, the paper introduces forward and
backward constraints generation to improve the instruction-following
capabilities of Code LLMs in controlled code generation, ensuring outputs align
more closely with human-defined guidelines. The authors further present
IFEvalCode, a multilingual benchmark comprising 1.6K test samples across seven
programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Shell, C++, and
C#), with each sample featuring both Chinese and English queries. Unlike
existing benchmarks, IFEvalCode decouples evaluation into two metrics:
correctness (Corr.) and instruction-following (Instr.), enabling a more nuanced
assessment. Experiments on over 40 LLMs reveal that closed-source models
outperform open-source ones in controllable code generation and highlight a
significant gap between the models' ability to generate correct code versus
code that precisely follows instructions.

Motivation: 尽管小语言模型（SLMs）在推理速度和边缘部署方面有优势，但其在Text-to-SQL任务中表现不佳，因此研究如何提升其性能。

Method: 利用SynSQL-2.5M数据集构建两个衍生数据集，采用监督微调和基于强化学习的后训练方法，并结合自一致性推理。

Result: 实验结果显示，SLM-SQL方法在BIRD开发集上平均提升31.4分，0.5B和1.5B模型的执行准确率分别达到56.87%和67.08%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了SLMs在Text-to-SQL任务中的性能，并展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL). In
contrast, small language models (SLMs) ranging from 0.5B to 1.5B parameters
currently underperform on Text-to-SQL tasks due to their limited logical
reasoning capabilities. However, SLMs offer inherent advantages in inference
speed and suitability for edge deployment. To explore their potential in
Text-to-SQL applications, we leverage recent advancements in post-training
techniques. Specifically, we used the open-source SynSQL-2.5M dataset to
construct two derived datasets: SynSQL-Think-916K for SQL generation and
SynSQL-Merge-Think-310K for SQL merge revision. We then applied supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning-based post-training to the SLM, followed
by inference using a corrective self-consistency approach. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method, SLM-SQL. On the
BIRD development set, the five evaluated models achieved an average improvement
of 31.4 points. Notably, the 0.5B model reached 56.87\% execution accuracy
(EX), while the 1.5B model achieved 67.08\% EX. We will release our dataset,
model, and code to github: https://github.com/CycloneBoy/slm_sql.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在临床决策支持中面临的三大挑战：处理长文本和多语言记录的困难、临床幻觉风险以及不可靠的评估指标。

Method: 将非结构化的纵向EHRs转换为患者特定的时间知识图谱（TKGs），并与规范性指南知识图谱对齐，生成临床总结和可操作建议。

Result: 在中文和英文数据集上，CliCARE显著优于基线方法，包括长上下文LLMs和知识图谱增强的RAG方法。

Conclusion: CliCARE通过结合时间知识图谱和临床指南，为癌症临床决策提供了高效、可靠的AI支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for improving clinical
decision support and reducing physician burnout by synthesizing complex,
longitudinal cancer Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, their
implementation in this critical field faces three primary challenges: the
inability to effectively process the extensive length and multilingual nature
of patient records for accurate temporal analysis; a heightened risk of
clinical hallucination, as conventional grounding techniques such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) do not adequately incorporate
process-oriented clinical guidelines; and unreliable evaluation metrics that
hinder the validation of AI systems in oncology. To address these issues, we
propose CliCARE, a framework for Grounding Large Language Models in Clinical
Guidelines for Decision Support over Longitudinal Cancer Electronic Health
Records. The framework operates by transforming unstructured, longitudinal EHRs
into patient-specific Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to capture long-range
dependencies, and then grounding the decision support process by aligning these
real-world patient trajectories with a normative guideline knowledge graph.
This approach provides oncologists with evidence-grounded decision support by
generating a high-fidelity clinical summary and an actionable recommendation.
We validated our framework using large-scale, longitudinal data from a private
Chinese cancer dataset and the public English MIMIC-IV dataset. In these
diverse settings, CliCARE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including
leading long-context LLMs and Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG methods. The
clinical validity of our results is supported by a robust evaluation protocol,
which demonstrates a high correlation with assessments made by expert
oncologists.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become essential for Question Answering (QA) systems, improving
efficiency and reducing human workload in customer service. The emergence of
Vietnamese LLMs (ViLLMs) highlights lightweight open-source models as a
practical choice for their accuracy, efficiency, and privacy benefits. However,
domain-specific evaluations remain limited, and the absence of benchmark
datasets reflecting real customer interactions makes it difficult for
enterprises to select suitable models for support applications. To address this
gap, we introduce the Customer Support Conversations Dataset (CSConDa), a
curated benchmark of over 9,000 QA pairs drawn from real interactions with
human advisors at a large Vietnamese software company. Covering diverse topics
such as pricing, product availability, and technical troubleshooting, CSConDa
provides a representative basis for evaluating ViLLMs in practical scenarios.
We further present a comprehensive evaluation framework, benchmarking 11
lightweight open-source ViLLMs on CSConDa with both automatic metrics and
syntactic analysis to reveal model strengths, weaknesses, and linguistic
patterns. This study offers insights into model behavior, explains performance
differences, and identifies key areas for improvement, supporting the
development of next-generation ViLLMs. By establishing a robust benchmark and
systematic evaluation, our work enables informed model selection for customer
service QA and advances research on Vietnamese LLMs. The dataset is publicly

*Sung-Min Lee,Siyoon Lee,Juyeon Kim,Kyungmin Roh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ControlMed是一种医疗语言模型，通过细粒度控制标记让用户主动控制推理长度，解决了现有推理LLMs在临床环境中因冗长推理导致的效率和延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策需要高可靠性的LLMs支持，但现有模型因推理过程冗长导致计算开销大和响应延迟，限制了实际应用。

Method: ControlMed通过三阶段训练：1）预训练大规模合成医疗指令数据集；2）监督微调多长度推理数据和显式长度控制标记；3）基于模型奖励信号的强化学习提升准确性和质量。

Result: 实验表明，ControlMed在多种医疗基准测试中性能与或优于现有模型，并能灵活平衡推理准确性和计算效率。

Conclusion: ControlMed是临床问答和医疗信息分析的实用且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) with enhanced accuracy and
explainability are increasingly being adopted in the medical domain, as the
life-critical nature of clinical decision-making demands reliable support.
Despite these advancements, existing reasoning LLMs often generate
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning processes, leading to significant computational
overhead and response latency. These limitations hinder their practical
deployment in real-world clinical environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{ControlMed}, a medical language model that enables users to
actively control the length of the reasoning process at inference time through
fine-grained control markers. ControlMed is trained through a three-stage
pipeline: 1) pre-training on a large-scale synthetic medical instruction
dataset covering both \textit{direct} and \textit{reasoning responses}; 2)
supervised fine-tuning with multi-length reasoning data and explicit
length-control markers; and 3) reinforcement learning with model-based reward
signals to enhance factual accuracy and response quality. Experimental results
on a variety of English and Korean medical benchmarks demonstrate that our
model achieves similar or better performance compared to state-of-the-art
models. Furthermore, users can flexibly balance reasoning accuracy and
computational efficiency by controlling the reasoning length as needed. These
findings demonstrate that ControlMed is a practical and adaptable solution for
clinical question answering and medical information analysis.

TL;DR: 论文提出CognitiveAttack框架，利用多认知偏差组合攻击LLM安全机制，显著提高攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全机制易受认知偏差攻击，但多偏差交互的潜力未被充分探索。

Method: 结合监督微调和强化学习，生成嵌入优化偏差组合的提示词。

Result: 在30种LLM中测试，攻击成功率显著高于现有方法（60.1% vs. 31.6%）。

Conclusion: 多偏差交互是强大攻击向量，需加强LLM安全机制以应对此类威胁。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to
adversarial attacks that exploit cognitive biases -- systematic deviations from
rational judgment. Unlike prior jailbreaking approaches focused on prompt
engineering or algorithmic manipulation, this work highlights the overlooked
power of multi-bias interactions in undermining LLM safeguards. We propose
CognitiveAttack, a novel red-teaming framework that systematically leverages
both individual and combined cognitive biases. By integrating supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, CognitiveAttack generates prompts that
embed optimized bias combinations, effectively bypassing safety protocols while
maintaining high attack success rates. Experimental results reveal significant
vulnerabilities across 30 diverse LLMs, particularly in open-source models.
CognitiveAttack achieves a substantially higher attack success rate compared to
the SOTA black-box method PAP (60.1% vs. 31.6%), exposing critical limitations
in current defense mechanisms. These findings highlight multi-bias interactions
as a powerful yet underexplored attack vector. This work introduces a novel
interdisciplinary perspective by bridging cognitive science and LLM safety,
paving the way for more robust and human-aligned AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言特定神经元在放大后对多语言模型行为的影响，尤其是低资源语言的表现。

Method: 通过干预18种语言的神经元放大，使用三种不同语言训练的模型，提出LSS评分评估效果，并在下游任务中测试。

Result: 放大因子能有效引导输出至目标语言，但对跨语言任务表现有负面影响。

Conclusion: 语言特定神经元的放大对低资源语言有益，但跨语言迁移效果有限。

Abstract: Language-specific neurons in LLMs that strongly correlate with individual
languages have been shown to influence model behavior by deactivating them.
However, their role in amplification remains underexplored. This work
investigates the effect of amplifying language-specific neurons through
interventions across 18 languages, including low-resource ones, using three
models primarily trained in different languages. We compare amplification
factors by their effectiveness in steering to the target language using a
proposed Language Steering Shift (LSS) evaluation score, then evaluate it on
downstream tasks: commonsense reasoning (XCOPA, XWinograd), knowledge
(Include), and translation (FLORES). The optimal amplification factors
effectively steer output toward nearly all tested languages. Intervention using
this factor on downstream tasks improves self-language performance in some
cases but generally degrades cross-language results. These findings highlight
the effect of language-specific neurons in multilingual behavior, where
amplification can be beneficial especially for low-resource languages, but
provides limited advantage for cross-lingual transfer.

Motivation: 阿拉伯语LLM性能落后于英语，主要由于数据稀缺、语言多样性和形态复杂性等问题，且现有基准测试质量不足。

Method: 引入BALSAM基准测试，包含78个NLP任务、52K示例，并提供透明平台进行盲评估。

Result: BALSAM为阿拉伯语LLM提供了统一的评估标准，促进协作研究。

Conclusion: BALSAM有望推动阿拉伯语LLM的发展，并解决现有基准测试的不足。

Abstract: The impressive advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) in English has not
been matched across all languages. In particular, LLM performance in Arabic
lags behind, due to data scarcity, linguistic diversity of Arabic and its
dialects, morphological complexity, etc. Progress is further hindered by the
quality of Arabic benchmarks, which typically rely on static, publicly
available data, lack comprehensive task coverage, or do not provide dedicated
platforms with blind test sets. This makes it challenging to measure actual
progress and to mitigate data contamination. Here, we aim to bridge these gaps.
In particular, we introduce BALSAM, a comprehensive, community-driven benchmark
aimed at advancing Arabic LLM development and evaluation. It includes 78 NLP
tasks from 14 broad categories, with 52K examples divided into 37K test and 15K
development, and a centralized, transparent platform for blind evaluation. We
envision BALSAM as a unifying platform that sets standards and promotes
collaborative research to advance Arabic LLM capabilities.

Motivation: 探索多语言大模型中语言特异性处理的神经机制，以揭示语言行为控制的底层原理。

Method: 使用LAPE方法分析语言特异性神经元，并通过语言算术操作（激活加减乘除）调控模型行为。

Conclusion: 语言特异性神经元的操控能有效指导模型行为，且跨语言神经元调控可提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities, yet the
neural mechanisms behind language-specific processing remain unclear. We
analyze language-specific neurons in Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-Nemo-12B, and
Aya-Expanse-8B & 32B across 21 typologically diverse languages, identifying
neurons that control language behavior. Using the Language Activation
Probability Entropy (LAPE) method, we show that these neurons cluster in deeper
layers, with non-Latin scripts showing greater specialization. Related
languages share overlapping neurons, reflecting internal representations of
linguistic proximity.
  Through language arithmetics, i.e. systematic activation addition and
multiplication, we steer models to deactivate unwanted languages and activate
desired ones, outperforming simpler replacement approaches. These interventions
effectively guide behavior across five multilingual tasks: language forcing,
translation, QA, comprehension, and NLI. Manipulation is more successful for
high-resource languages, while typological similarity improves effectiveness.
We also demonstrate that cross-lingual neuron steering enhances downstream
performance and reveal internal "fallback" mechanisms for language selection
when neurons are progressively deactivated. Our code is made publicly available

Motivation: LLMs在日常工具中的应用日益广泛，但其政治偏见的影响尚未全面研究，尤其是在多语言和模型多样性方面。

Method: 评估了7个模型（如LLaMA-3.1、Qwen-3）在14种语言中的政治倾向，采用政治罗盘测试及语义等效重述确保测量准确性，并测试了干预技术的效果。

Result: 较大模型普遍偏向自由左翼，且政治立场在不同语言和模型家族中存在显著差异；干预技术能有效操控模型的政治立场。

Conclusion: LLMs的政治偏见具有普遍性和可操控性，需进一步研究其影响和调控方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in everyday tools and
applications, raising concerns about their potential influence on political
views. While prior research has shown that LLMs often exhibit measurable
political biases--frequently skewing toward liberal or progressive
positions--key gaps remain. Most existing studies evaluate only a narrow set of
models and languages, leaving open questions about the generalizability of
political biases across architectures, scales, and multilingual settings.
Moreover, few works examine whether these biases can be actively controlled.
  In this work, we address these gaps through a large-scale study of political
orientation in modern open-source instruction-tuned LLMs. We evaluate seven
models, including LLaMA-3.1, Qwen-3, and Aya-Expanse, across 14 languages using
the Political Compass Test with 11 semantically equivalent paraphrases per
statement to ensure robust measurement. Our results reveal that larger models
consistently shift toward libertarian-left positions, with significant
variations across languages and model families. To test the manipulability of
political stances, we utilize a simple center-of-mass activation intervention
technique and show that it reliably steers model responses toward alternative
ideological positions across multiple languages. Our code is publicly available

Motivation: 面试表现评估对候选人选拔至关重要，但传统方法可能不够全面或公平。本文旨在通过多模态数据整合和先进算法提升评估的准确性和公正性。

Method: 采用多模态特征提取器编码视频、音频和文本数据，通过共享压缩多层感知机融合特征，并利用两级集成学习策略（独立回归头和均值池化）生成最终评分。

Result: 在AVI Challenge 2025中获得第一名，多维度平均MSE为0.1824，证明了框架的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过捕捉显性和隐性线索，实现了全面且无偏的面试表现评估，为自动化多模态评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Interview performance assessment is essential for determining candidates'
suitability for professional positions. To ensure holistic and fair
evaluations, we propose a novel and comprehensive framework that explores
``365'' aspects of interview performance by integrating \textit{three}
modalities (video, audio, and text), \textit{six} responses per candidate, and
\textit{five} key evaluation dimensions. The framework employs
modality-specific feature extractors to encode heterogeneous data streams and
subsequently fused via a Shared Compression Multilayer Perceptron. This module
compresses multimodal embeddings into a unified latent space, facilitating
efficient feature interaction. To enhance prediction robustness, we incorporate
a two-level ensemble learning strategy: (1) independent regression heads
predict scores for each response, and (2) predictions are aggregated across
responses using a mean-pooling mechanism to produce final scores for the five
target dimensions. By listening to the unspoken, our approach captures both
explicit and implicit cues from multimodal data, enabling comprehensive and
unbiased assessments. Achieving a multi-dimensional average MSE of 0.1824, our
framework secured first place in the AVI Challenge 2025, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in advancing automated and multimodal interview
performance assessment. The full implementation is available at

Method: 提出TIRESRAG-R1框架，采用思考-检索-反思流程和多维度奖励系统（充分性奖励、推理质量奖励、反思奖励），并结合难度感知重加权策略和训练样本过滤。

Result: 在四个多跳QA数据集上，TIRESRAG-R1优于现有RAG方法，并能泛化到单跳任务。

Conclusion: TIRESRAG-R1通过改进推理和稳定性，显著提升了RAG方法的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods
enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most
rely only on final-answer rewards, overlooking intermediate reasoning quality.
This paper analyzes existing RAG reasoning models and identifies three main
failure patterns: (1) information insufficiency, meaning the model fails to
retrieve adequate support; (2) faulty reasoning, where logical or content-level
flaws appear despite sufficient information; and (3) answer-reasoning
inconsistency, where a valid reasoning chain leads to a mismatched final
answer. We propose TIRESRAG-R1, a novel framework using a
think-retrieve-reflect process and a multi-dimensional reward system to improve
reasoning and stability. TIRESRAG-R1 introduces: (1) a sufficiency reward to
encourage thorough retrieval; (2) a reasoning quality reward to assess the
rationality and accuracy of the reasoning chain; and (3) a reflection reward to
detect and revise errors. It also employs a difficulty-aware reweighting
strategy and training sample filtering to boost performance on complex tasks.
Experiments on four multi-hop QA datasets show that TIRESRAG-R1 outperforms
prior RAG methods and generalizes well to single-hop tasks. The code and data

Motivation: 提升LLM在多语言环境中的可靠性，解决幻觉问题。

Method: 分析GPT-3.5、GPT-4o等六种模型在印地语、波斯语和汉语中的表现。

Result: 汉语中幻觉最少，印地语和波斯语中幻觉显著更多。

Conclusion: 需针对不同语言优化LLM以减少幻觉。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
generating text that closely resemble human writing. However, they often
generate factually incorrect statements, a problem typically referred to as
'hallucination'. Addressing hallucination is crucial for enhancing the
reliability and effectiveness of LLMs. While much research has focused on
hallucinations in English, our study extends this investigation to
conversational data in three languages: Hindi, Farsi, and Mandarin. We offer a
comprehensive analysis of a dataset to examine both factual and linguistic
errors in these languages for GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, Gemma-2.0,
DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3. We found that LLMs produce very few hallucinated
responses in Mandarin but generate a significantly higher number of
hallucinations in Hindi and Farsi.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在文本生成中表现出色，但其向量聚合为文本嵌入时会丢失关键信息，而许多非生成任务（如聚类、分类或检索）需要准确且可控的句子或文档级嵌入。

Method: 研究采用三种策略：(i) 词嵌入的聚合技术，(ii) 任务特定提示工程，(iii) 通过对比微调进行文本级增强。

Result: 结合这些方法在MTEB的英文聚类任务中达到最优性能，微调后注意力更集中于语义相关词汇。

Conclusion: LLMs可通过提示工程和资源高效的对比微调有效适配为文本嵌入模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), achieving impressive performance in text generation. Their
token-level representations capture rich, human-aligned semantics. However,
pooling these vectors into a text embedding discards crucial information.
Nevertheless, many non-generative downstream tasks, such as clustering,
classification, or retrieval, still depend on accurate and controllable
sentence- or document-level embeddings. We explore several adaptation
strategies for pre-trained, decoder-only LLMs: (i) various aggregation
techniques for token embeddings, (ii) task-specific prompt engineering, and
(iii) text-level augmentation via contrastive fine-tuning. Combining these
components yields state-of-the-art performance on the English clustering track
of the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). An analysis of the attention
map further shows that fine-tuning shifts focus from prompt tokens to
semantically relevant words, indicating more effective compression of meaning
into the final hidden state. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can be
effectively adapted as text embedding models through a combination of prompt
engineering and resource-efficient contrastive fine-tuning on synthetically
generated positive pairs.

Abstract: Reducing hallucinations in abstractive summarization remains a critical
challenge for deploying language models (LMs) in real-world settings. In this
work, we introduce a rewarddriven fine-tuning framework that explicitly
optimizes for Entity Hallucination Index (EHI), a metric designed to quantify
the presence, correctness, and grounding of named entities in generated
summaries. Given a corpus of meeting transcripts, we first generate baseline
summaries using a pre-trained LM and compute EHI scores via automatic entity
extraction and matching. We then apply reinforcement learning to fine-tune the
model parameters, using EHI as a reward signal to bias generation toward
entity-faithful outputs. Our approach does not rely on human-written factuality
annotations, enabling scalable fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements in EHI across datasets, with qualitative analysis revealing a
significant reduction in entity-level hallucinations without degradation in
fluency or informativeness. We release a reproducible Colab pipeline,
facilitating further research on hallucination-aware model fine-tuning using
lightweight, hallucintion metrics like EHI.

Abstract: We introduce a benchmark for open-ended regional question answering that
encompasses both textual and visual modalities. We also provide strong
baselines using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our dataset
consists of manually curated questions and answers grounded in Wikipedia,
created by native speakers from Czechia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, with
accompanying English translations. It includes both purely textual questions
and those requiring visual understanding. As a baseline, we evaluate
state-of-the-art LLMs through prompting and complement this with human
judgments of answer correctness. Using these human evaluations, we analyze the
reliability of existing automatic evaluation metrics. Our baseline results
highlight a significant gap in regional knowledge among current LLMs. Moreover,
apart from LLM-based evaluation, there is minimal correlation between automated
metrics and human judgment. We release this dataset as a resource to (1) assess
regional knowledge in LLMs, (2) study cross-lingual generation consistency in a
challenging setting, and (3) advance the development of evaluation metrics for
open-ended question answering.

Abstract: Recent advancements in financial problem-solving have leveraged LLMs and

However, credit assessment remains an underexplored challenge, traditionally
dependent on rule-based methods and statistical models. In this paper, we
introduce MASCA, an LLM-driven multi-agent system designed to enhance credit

employs a layered architecture where specialized LLM-based agents
collaboratively tackle sub-tasks. Additionally, we integrate contrastive
learning for risk and reward assessment to optimize decision-making. We further
present a signaling game theory perspective on hierarchical multi-agent
systems, offering theoretical insights into their structure and interactions.
Our paper also includes a detailed bias analysis in credit assessment,
addressing fairness concerns. Experimental results demonstrate that MASCA
outperforms baseline approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of hierarchical
LLM-based multi-agent systems in financial applications, particularly in credit
scoring.

Motivation: DBLP 2025版新增了dblp:Stream实体类型，需要改进现有实体链接方法以适应新版本。

Method: 使用LLMs的零样本方法，通过计算“yes”标记的对数概率对候选实体进行重排序。

Result: 开发了一种新型的零样本实体链接器，适用于DBLP 2025版知识图谱。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了新版本知识图谱的实体链接问题，展示了LLMs在零样本任务中的潜力。

Abstract: In this work we present an entity linker for DBLP's 2025 version of RDF-based

venues as a new entity type called dblp:Stream. In the earlier version of
DBLPLink, we trained KG-embeddings and re-rankers on a dataset to produce
entity linkings. In contrast, in this work, we develop a zero-shot entity
linker using LLMs using a novel method, where we re-rank candidate entities
based on the log-probabilities of the "yes" token output at the penultimate
layer of the LLM.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结构化表示方法TaSoF和框架SPaGe，用于查询聚焦的表格摘要任务，解决了自然语言计划的模糊性和可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言计划在表格摘要中存在模糊性和缺乏结构的问题，限制了其转换为可执行程序（如SQL）的能力，尤其是在多表任务中。

Method: 提出结构化计划TaSoF和框架SPaGe，分为三个阶段：结构化规划、基于图的执行和摘要生成。

Result: 在三个公共基准测试中，SPaGe在单表和多表任务中均优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 结构化表示显著提升了表格摘要的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires complex reasoning, often
approached through step-by-step natural language (NL) plans. However, NL plans
are inherently ambiguous and lack structure, limiting their conversion into
executable programs like SQL and hindering scalability, especially for
multi-table tasks. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift to structured
representations. We introduce a new structured plan, TaSoF, inspired by
formalism in traditional multi-agent systems, and a framework, SPaGe, that
formalizes the reasoning process in three phases: 1) Structured Planning to
generate TaSoF from a query, 2) Graph-based Execution to convert plan steps
into SQL and model dependencies via a directed cyclic graph for parallel
execution, and 3) Summary Generation to produce query-focused summaries. Our
method explicitly captures complex dependencies and improves reliability.
Experiments on three public benchmarks show that SPaGe consistently outperforms
prior models in both single- and multi-table settings, demonstrating the
advantages of structured representations for robust and scalable summarization.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）中上下文学习（ICL）的位置偏差（DPP），发现演示（demos）位置的变化显著影响模型预测和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ICL中未被研究的位置偏差，揭示其对模型性能的影响。

Method: 设计系统评估流程，引入ACCURACY-CHANGE和PREDICTION-CHANGE指标，分析四种任务类型中的偏差。

Result: 实验表明，demos位置对模型准确性影响显著，起始位置表现最佳，末尾位置预测波动大。

Conclusion: DPP偏差普遍存在，模型大小和任务复杂度影响其程度，起始位置为最优选择。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a critical emerging capability of large language
models (LLMs), enabling few-shot learning during inference by including a few
demonstrations (demos) in the prompt. However, it has been found that ICL's
performance can be sensitive to the choices of demos and their order. This
paper investigates an unexplored new positional bias of ICL for the first time:
we observe that the predictions and accuracy can drift drastically when the
positions of demos, the system prompt, and the user message in LLM input are
varied. We refer to this bias as DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP) bias. We
design a systematic evaluation pipeline to study this type of positional bias
across classification, question answering, summarization, and reasoning tasks.
We introduce two metrics, ACCURACY-CHANGE and PREDICTION-CHANGE, to quantify
net gains and output volatility induced by changes in the demos' position.
Extensive experiments on ten LLMs from four open-source model families (QWEN,
LLAMA3, MISTRAL, COHERE) verify that the bias significantly affects their
accuracy and predictions: placing demos at the start of the prompt yields the
most stable and accurate outputs with gains of up to +6 points. In contrast,
placing demos at the end of the user message flips over 30\% of predictions
without improving correctness on QA tasks. Smaller models are most affected by
this sensitivity, though even large models remain marginally affected on
complex tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解欺骗性指令如何改变LLM的内部表征，以解决模型安全挑战。

Method: 分析Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Gemma-2-9B-Instruct在事实验证任务中的内部表征，使用线性探测和稀疏自编码器（SAEs）研究表征变化。

Result: 欺骗性指令导致显著的表征变化，集中在早期至中层，并识别出对欺骗性指令敏感的特征。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了欺骗性指令的表征特征，为LLM的检测和控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to follow maliciously crafted instructions
to generate deceptive responses, posing safety challenges. How deceptive
instructions alter the internal representations of LLM compared to truthful
ones remains poorly understood beyond output analysis. To bridge this gap, we
investigate when and how these representations ``flip'', such as from truthful
to deceptive, under deceptive versus truthful/neutral instructions. Analyzing
the internal representations of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct
on a factual verification task, we find the model's instructed True/False
output is predictable via linear probes across all conditions based on the
internal representation. Further, we use Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to show
that the Deceptive instructions induce significant representational shifts
compared to Truthful/Neutral representations (which are similar), concentrated
in early-to-mid layers and detectable even on complex datasets. We also
identify specific SAE features highly sensitive to deceptive instruction and
use targeted visualizations to confirm distinct truthful/deceptive
representational subspaces. % Our analysis pinpoints layer-wise and
feature-level correlates of instructed dishonesty, offering insights for LLM
detection and control. Our findings expose feature- and layer-level signatures
of deception, offering new insights for detecting and mitigating instructed
dishonesty in LLMs.

Result: 结果表明，系统性要求需基于合理性动态调整，而非固定标准。

Conclusion: 结论指出，AI模型的系统性应根据实际需求动态调整，而非盲目追求系统性。

Abstract: This paper argues that explainability is only one facet of a broader ideal
that shapes our expectations towards artificial intelligence (AI).
Fundamentally, the issue is to what extent AI exhibits systematicity--not
merely in being sensitive to how thoughts are composed of recombinable
constituents, but in striving towards an integrated body of thought that is
consistent, coherent, comprehensive, and parsimoniously principled. This richer
conception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the
"systematicity challenge" to connectionism, according to which network
architectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed
"the systematicity of thought." I offer a conceptual framework for thinking
about "the systematicity of thought" that distinguishes four senses of the
phrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between
systematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity
that historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,
authoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To
determine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of
systematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization
and explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such
rationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the "hard systematicity
challenge." However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be
regulated by the rationales for systematization. This yields a dynamic
understanding of the need to systematize thought, which tells us how systematic
we need AI models to be and when.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理设计无法有效将新观察动态更新到世界模型中，导致规划与真实世界状态错位。

Method: 引入分层状态抽象的CoEx架构，结合LLM推理和神经符号信念状态动态更新世界模型。

Result: 在ALFWorld、PDDL和Jericho等复杂任务中，CoEx表现优于现有代理范式。

Conclusion: CoEx通过动态世界模型和分层规划，显著提升了代理的规划和探索能力。

Abstract: Planning in modern LLM agents relies on the utilization of LLM as an internal
world model, acquired during pretraining. However, existing agent designs fail
to effectively assimilate new observations into dynamic updates of the world
model. This reliance on the LLM's static internal world model is progressively
prone to misalignment with the underlying true state of the world, leading to
the generation of divergent and erroneous plans. We introduce a hierarchical
agent architecture, CoEx, in which hierarchical state abstraction allows LLM
planning to co-evolve with a dynamically updated model of the world. CoEx plans
and interacts with the world by using LLM reasoning to orchestrate dynamic
plans consisting of subgoals, and its learning mechanism continuously
incorporates these subgoal experiences into a persistent world model in the
form of a neurosymbolic belief state, comprising textual inferences and
code-based symbolic memory. We evaluate our agent across a diverse set of agent
scenarios involving rich environments and complex tasks including ALFWorld,
PDDL, and Jericho. Our experiments show that CoEx outperforms existing agent
paradigms in planning and exploration.

Abstract: Metaverse service is a product of the convergence between Metaverse and
service systems, designed to address service-related challenges concerning
digital avatars, digital twins, and digital natives within Metaverse. With the
rise of large language models (LLMs), agents now play a pivotal role in
Metaverse service ecosystem, serving dual functions: as digital avatars
representing users in the virtual realm and as service assistants (or NPCs)
providing personalized support. However, during the modeling of Metaverse
service ecosystems, existing LLM-based agents face significant challenges in
bridging virtual-world services with real-world services, particularly
regarding issues such as character data fusion, character knowledge
association, and ethical safety concerns. This paper proposes an explainable
emotion alignment framework for LLM-based agents in Metaverse Service
Ecosystem. It aims to integrate factual factors into the decision-making loop
of LLM-based agents, systematically demonstrating how to achieve more
relational fact alignment for these agents. Finally, a simulation experiment in
the Offline-to-Offline food delivery scenario is conducted to evaluate the
effectiveness of this framework, obtaining more realistic social emergence.

Result: 评估显示Magentic-UI在任务完成、用户测试和安全性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Magentic-UI有望推动安全高效的人机协作。

Abstract: AI agents powered by large language models are increasingly capable of
autonomously completing complex, multi-step tasks using external tools. Yet,
they still fall short of human-level performance in most domains including
computer use, software development, and research. Their growing autonomy and
ability to interact with the outside world, also introduces safety and security
risks including potentially misaligned actions and adversarial manipulation. We
argue that human-in-the-loop agentic systems offer a promising path forward,
combining human oversight and control with AI efficiency to unlock productivity
from imperfect systems. We introduce Magentic-UI, an open-source web interface
for developing and studying human-agent interaction. Built on a flexible
multi-agent architecture, Magentic-UI supports web browsing, code execution,
and file manipulation, and can be extended with diverse tools via Model Context
Protocol (MCP). Moreover, Magentic-UI presents six interaction mechanisms for
enabling effective, low-cost human involvement: co-planning, co-tasking,
multi-tasking, action guards, and long-term memory. We evaluate Magentic-UI
across four dimensions: autonomous task completion on agentic benchmarks,
simulated user testing of its interaction capabilities, qualitative studies
with real users, and targeted safety assessments. Our findings highlight
Magentic-UI's potential to advance safe and efficient human-agent
collaboration.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型评估方法存在数据污染、黑箱操作和主观偏好等问题，难以全面评估模型的真实能力。

Method: 提出LLM-Crowdsourced方法，利用LLMs生成问题、独立回答并相互评估，整合动态、透明、客观和专业四项关键标准。

Result: 在数学和编程任务上对八种主流LLMs的实验验证了该方法的优势，并发现了一些传统方法难以检测的新现象。

Conclusion: LLM-Crowdsourced方法能更全面、客观地评估LLMs的能力，揭示了传统方法难以发现的模型行为特征。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
across various tasks, evaluating their capabilities remains a challenging task.
Existing evaluation methods suffer from issues such as data contamination,
black-box operation, and subjective preference. These issues make it difficult
to evaluate the LLMs' true capabilities comprehensively. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a novel benchmark-free evaluation paradigm,
LLM-Crowdsourced. It utilizes LLMs to generate questions, answer independently,
and evaluate mutually. This method integrates four key evaluation criteria:
dynamic, transparent, objective, and professional, which existing evaluation
methods cannot satisfy simultaneously. Experiments on eight mainstream LLMs
across mathematics and programming verify the advantages of our method in
distinguishing LLM performance. Furthermore, our study reveals several novel
findings that are difficult for traditional methods to detect, including but
not limited to: (1) Gemini demonstrates the highest original and professional
question-design capabilities among others; (2) Some LLMs exhibit
''memorization-based answering'' by misrecognizing questions as familiar ones
with a similar structure; (3) LLM evaluation results demonstrate high
consistency (robustness).

Conclusion: 评估AI辅助决策时，需同时考虑预测准确性和元认知敏感性，并优化两者以实现更优决策结果。

Abstract: In settings where human decision-making relies on AI input, both the
predictive accuracy of the AI system and the reliability of its confidence
estimates influence decision quality. We highlight the role of AI metacognitive
sensitivity -- its ability to assign confidence scores that accurately
distinguish correct from incorrect predictions -- and introduce a theoretical
framework for assessing the joint impact of AI's predictive accuracy and
metacognitive sensitivity in hybrid decision-making settings. Our analysis
identifies conditions under which an AI with lower predictive accuracy but
higher metacognitive sensitivity can enhance the overall accuracy of human
decision making. Finally, a behavioral experiment confirms that greater AI
metacognitive sensitivity improves human decision performance. Together, these
findings underscore the importance of evaluating AI assistance not only by
accuracy but also by metacognitive sensitivity, and of optimizing both to
achieve superior decision outcomes.

fidelity: intelligence is the ability, given sample(s) from a category, to
generate sample(s) from the same category. We formalise this intuition as
{\epsilon}-category intelligence: it is {\epsilon}-intelligent with respect to
a category if no chosen admissible distinguisher can separate generated from
original samples beyond tolerance {\epsilon}. We present the formal framework,
outline empirical protocols, and discuss implications for evaluation, safety,
and generalization.

Abstract: The Nearest-Better Network (NBN) is a powerful method to visualize sampled
data for continuous optimization problems while preserving multiple landscape
features. However, the calculation of NBN is very time-consuming, and the
extension of the method to combinatorial optimization problems is challenging
but very important for analyzing the algorithm's behavior. This paper provides
a straightforward theoretical derivation showing that the NBN network
essentially functions as the maximum probability transition network for
algorithms. This paper also presents an efficient NBN computation method with
logarithmic linear time complexity to address the time-consuming issue. By
applying this efficient NBN algorithm to the OneMax problem and the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP), we have made several remarkable discoveries for the
first time: The fitness landscape of OneMax exhibits neutrality, ruggedness,
and modality features. The primary challenges of TSP problems are ruggedness,
modality, and deception. Two state-of-the-art TSP algorithms (i.e., EAX and
LKH) have limitations when addressing challenges related to modality and
deception, respectively. LKH, based on local search operators, fails when there
are deceptive solutions near global optima. EAX, which is based on a single
population, can efficiently maintain diversity. However, when multiple
attraction basins exist, EAX retains individuals within multiple basins
simultaneously, reducing inter-basin interaction efficiency and leading to
algorithm's stagnation.

Abstract: The post-pandemic surge in healthcare demand, coupled with critical nursing
shortages, has placed unprecedented pressure on emergency department triage
systems, necessitating innovative AI-driven solutions. We present a multi-agent
interactive intelligent system for medical triage that addresses three
fundamental challenges in current AI-based triage systems: insufficient medical
specialization leading to hallucination-induced misclassifications,
heterogeneous department structures across healthcare institutions, and
inefficient detail-oriented questioning that impedes rapid triage decisions.
Our system employs three specialized agents - RecipientAgent, InquirerAgent,
and DepartmentAgent - that collaborate through structured inquiry mechanisms
and department-specific guidance rules to transform unstructured patient
symptoms into accurate department recommendations. To ensure robust evaluation,
we constructed a comprehensive Chinese medical triage dataset from a medical
website, comprising 3,360 real-world cases spanning 9 primary departments and
62 secondary departments. Through systematic data imputation using large
language models, we address the prevalent issue of incomplete medical records
in real-world data. Experimental results demonstrate that our multi-agent
system achieves 89.2% accuracy in primary department classification and 73.9%
accuracy in secondary department classification after four rounds of patient
interaction. The system's pattern-matching-based guidance mechanisms enable
efficient adaptation to diverse hospital configurations while maintaining high
triage accuracy. Our work provides a scalable framework for deploying
AI-assisted triage systems that can accommodate the organizational
heterogeneity of healthcare institutions while ensuring clinically sound
decision-making.

Conclusion: MetaAgent为多智能体系统设计提供了高效自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to solve a wide
range of practical tasks within multi-agent systems. However, existing
human-designed multi-agent frameworks are typically limited to a small set of
pre-defined scenarios, while current automated design methods suffer from
several limitations, such as the lack of tool integration, dependence on
external training data, and rigid communication structures. In this paper, we
propose MetaAgent, a finite state machine based framework that can
automatically generate a multi-agent system. Given a task description,
MetaAgent will design a multi-agent system and polish it through an
optimization algorithm. When the multi-agent system is deployed, the finite
state machine will control the agent's actions and the state transitions. To
evaluate our framework, we conduct experiments on both text-based tasks and
practical tasks. The results indicate that the generated multi-agent system
surpasses other auto-designed methods and can achieve a comparable performance
with the human-designed multi-agent system, which is optimized for those
specific tasks.

Motivation: 制造业中知识图谱（KG）的数据管理强大但复杂，非专家用户难以直接使用SPARQL查询。LLM的潜力在于通过自然语言接口降低使用门槛，但需解决如何有效传递KG上下文的问题。

Method: 评估了多种策略，通过LLM作为中介，将自然语言查询转换为SPARQL查询。重点研究了制造业领域的Bosch Line Information System KG和I40 Core Information Model，比较了不同上下文传递方法的效果。

Result: 研究发现，当LLM获得适当的KG模式上下文时，生成正确且完整查询的能力显著提升。上下文感知提示技术减少了LLM的幻觉风险。

Conclusion: 提出的上下文感知技术有望通过LLM简化复杂数据存储库的访问，支持制造业中的决策制定。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have transformed data management within the
manufacturing industry, offering effective means for integrating disparate data
sources through shared and structured conceptual schemas. However, harnessing
the power of KGs can be daunting for non-experts, as it often requires
formulating complex SPARQL queries to retrieve specific information. With the
advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing potential to
automatically translate natural language queries into the SPARQL format, thus
bridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and the sophisticated
architecture of KGs. The challenge remains in adequately informing LLMs about
the relevant context and structure of domain-specific KGs, e.g., in
manufacturing, to improve the accuracy of generated queries. In this paper, we
evaluate multiple strategies that use LLMs as mediators to facilitate
information retrieval from KGs. We focus on the manufacturing domain,
particularly on the Bosch Line Information System KG and the I40 Core
Information Model. In our evaluation, we compare various approaches for feeding
relevant context from the KG to the LLM and analyze their proficiency in
transforming real-world questions into SPARQL queries. Our findings show that
LLMs can significantly improve their performance on generating correct and
complete queries when provided only the adequate context of the KG schema. Such
context-aware prompting techniques help LLMs to focus on the relevant parts of
the ontology and reduce the risk of hallucination. We anticipate that the
proposed techniques help LLMs to democratize access to complex data
repositories and empower informed decision-making in manufacturing settings.

Conclusion: asp-fzn是一个有前景的CASP求解器，性能优越且语言支持丰富。

Abstract: We present the solver asp-fzn for Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP),
which extends ASP with linear constraints. Our approach is based on translating
CASP programs into the solver-independent FlatZinc language that supports
several Constraint Programming and Integer Programming backend solvers. Our
solver supports a rich language of linear constraints, including some common
global constraints. As for evaluation, we show that asp-fzn is competitive with
state-of-the-art ASP solvers on benchmarks taken from past ASP competitions.
Furthermore, we evaluate it on several CASP problems from the literature and
compare its performance with clingcon, which is a prominent CASP solver that
supports most of the asp-fzn language. The performance of asp-fzn is very
promising as it is already competitive on plain ASP and even outperforms
clingcon on some CASP benchmarks.

Conclusion: TAAC能有效提升多智能体协作性能，适用于复杂合作任务。

Abstract: This paper introduces Team-Attention-Actor-Critic (TAAC), a reinforcement
learning algorithm designed to enhance multi-agent collaboration in cooperative
environments. TAAC employs a Centralized Training/Centralized Execution scheme
incorporating multi-headed attention mechanisms in both the actor and critic.
This design facilitates dynamic, inter-agent communication, allowing agents to
explicitly query teammates, thereby efficiently managing the exponential growth
of joint-action spaces while ensuring a high degree of collaboration. We
further introduce a penalized loss function which promotes diverse yet
complementary roles among agents. We evaluate TAAC in a simulated soccer
environment against benchmark algorithms representing other multi-agent
paradigms, including Proximal Policy Optimization and Multi-Agent
Actor-Attention-Critic. We find that TAAC exhibits superior performance and
enhanced collaborative behaviors across a variety of metrics (win rates, goal
differentials, Elo ratings, inter-agent connectivity, balanced spatial
distributions, and frequent tactical interactions such as ball possession
swaps).

Motivation: 现代SAT求解器在复杂架构下难以优化，现有自动配置框架依赖手动约束搜索空间且性能提升有限。

Method: 提出LLM友好的求解器设计、自动提示优化方法和高效搜索策略（预搜索和EA进化算法）。

Result: AutoModSAT在实验中比基线求解器性能提升50%，优于现有最优求解器30%，速度平均提升20%。

Conclusion: 该研究为下一代复杂求解器开发提供了方法论进步和实证结果，填补了AI驱动启发式发现与关键系统优化之间的空白。

Abstract: Satisfiability problem (SAT) is a cornerstone of computational complexity
with broad industrial applications, and it remains challenging to optimize
modern SAT solvers in real-world settings due to their intricate architectures.
While automatic configuration frameworks have been developed, they rely on
manually constrained search spaces and yield limited performance gains. This
work introduces a novel paradigm which effectively optimizes complex SAT
solvers via Large Language Models (LLMs), and a tool called AutoModSAT is
developed. Three fundamental challenges are addressed in order to achieve
superior performance: (1) LLM-friendly solver: Systematic guidelines are
proposed for developing a modularized solver to meet LLMs' compatibility,
emphasizing code simplification, information share and bug reduction; (2)
Automatic prompt optimization: An unsupervised automatic prompt optimization
method is introduced to advance the diversity of LLMs' output; (3) Efficient
search strategy: We design a presearch strategy and an EA evolutionary
algorithm for the final efficient and effective discovery of heuristics.
Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets demonstrate that
AutoModSAT achieves 50% performance improvement over the baseline solver and
achieves 30% superiority against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solvers. Moreover,
AutoModSAT attains a 20% speedup on average compared to parameter-tuned
alternatives of the SOTA solvers, showcasing the enhanced capability in
handling complex problem instances. This work bridges the gap between AI-driven
heuristics discovery and mission-critical system optimization, and provides
both methodological advancements and empirically validated results for
next-generation complex solver development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索软翻转机器人在运输较大、较重负载方面的潜力，以扩展其在危险环境中的应用。

Method: 基于现有模型分析负载对机器人性能的影响，开发预测负载滑动的模型，并通过实验验证不同形状、大小和重量的负载运输能力。

Result: 实验证明机器人可运输重达1.5kg的负载，通过最小0.01cm间隙的孔洞，完成135度转弯，跨越1.15m的无支撑间隙。

Conclusion: 软翻转机器人具备运输多样化负载的能力，为危险环境中的任务提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Soft everting robots present significant advantages over traditional rigid
robots, including enhanced dexterity, improved environmental interaction, and
safe navigation in unpredictable environments. While soft everting robots have
been widely demonstrated for exploration type tasks, their potential to move
and deploy payloads in such tasks has been less investigated, with previous
work focusing on sensors and tools for the robot. Leveraging the navigation
capabilities, and deployed body, of the soft everting robot to deliver payloads
in hazardous areas, e.g. carrying a water bottle to a person stuck under
debris, would represent a significant capability in many applications. In this
work, we present an analysis of how soft everting robots can be used to deploy
larger, heavier payloads through the inside of the robot. We analyze both what
objects can be deployed and what terrain features they can be carried through.
Building on existing models, we present methods to quantify the effects of
payloads on robot growth and self-support, and develop a model to predict
payload slip. We then experimentally quantify payload transport using soft
everting robot with a variety of payload shapes, sizes, and weights and though
a series of tasks: steering, vertical transport, movement through holes, and
movement across gaps. Overall, the results show that we can transport payloads
in a variety of shapes and up to 1.5kg in weight and that we can move through
circular apertures with as little as 0.01cm clearance around payloads, carry
out discrete turns up to 135 degrees, and move across unsupported gaps of 1.15m
in length.

Abstract: Wheel-legged robots integrate the agility of legs for navigating rough
terrains while harnessing the efficiency of wheels for smooth surfaces.
However, most existing designs do not fully capitalize on the benefits of both
legged and wheeled structures, which limits overall system flexibility and
efficiency. We present FLORES (reconfigured wheel-legged robot for enhanced
steering and adaptability), a novel wheel-legged robot design featuring a
distinctive front-leg configuration that sets it beyond standard design
approaches. Specifically, FLORES replaces the conventional hip-roll degree of
freedom (DoF) of the front leg with hip-yaw DoFs, and this allows for efficient
movement on flat surfaces while ensuring adaptability when navigating complex
terrains. This innovative design facilitates seamless transitions between
different locomotion modes (i.e., legged locomotion and wheeled locomotion) and
optimizes the performance across varied environments. To fully exploit FLORES's
mechanical capabilities, we develop a tailored reinforcement learning (RL)
controller that adapts the Hybrid Internal Model (HIM) with a customized reward
structure optimized for our unique mechanical configuration. This framework
enables the generation of adaptive, multi-modal locomotion strategies that
facilitate smooth transitions between wheeled and legged movements.
Furthermore, our distinctive joint design enables the robot to exhibit novel
and highly efficient locomotion gaits that capitalize on the synergistic
advantages of both locomotion modes. Through comprehensive experiments, we
demonstrate FLORES's enhanced steering capabilities, improved navigation
efficiency, and versatile locomotion across various terrains. The open-source

Result: 系统能准确识别需要更高交互力的区域，支持土壤感知规划。

Conclusion: 该方法为自主地形塑造提供了有前景的土壤感知解决方案。

Abstract: Existing earthmoving autonomy is largely confined to highly controlled and
well-characterized environments due to the complexity of vehicle-terrain
interaction dynamics and the partial observability of the terrain resulting
from unknown and spatially varying soil conditions. In this chapter, a a
soil-property mapping system is proposed to extend the environmental state, in
order to overcome these restrictions and facilitate development of more robust
autonomous earthmoving. A GPU accelerated elevation mapping system is extended
to incorporate a blind mapping component which traces the movement of the blade
through the terrain to displace and erode intersected soil, enabling separately
tracking undisturbed and disturbed soil. Each interaction is approximated as a
flat blade moving through a locally homogeneous soil, enabling modeling of
cutting forces using the fundamental equation of earthmoving (FEE). Building
upon our prior work on in situ soil-property estimation, a method is devised to
extract approximate geometric parameters of the model given the uneven terrain,
and an improved physics infused neural network (PINN) model is developed to
predict soil properties and uncertainties of these estimates. A simulation of a
compact track loader (CTL) with a blade attachment is used to collect data to
train the PINN model. Post-training, the model is leveraged online by the
mapping system to track soil property estimates spatially as separate layers in
the map, with updates being performed in a Bayesian manner. Initial experiments
show that the system accurately highlights regions requiring higher relative
interaction forces, indicating the promise of this approach in enabling
soil-aware planning for autonomous terrain shaping.

Conclusion: 该方法无需复杂的特征解耦，即可有效提升模仿学习的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent developments in imitation learning have considerably advanced robotic
manipulation. However, current techniques in imitation learning can suffer from
poor generalization, limiting performance even under relatively minor domain
shifts. In this work, we aim to enhance the generalization capabilities of
complex imitation learning algorithms to handle unpredictable changes from the
training environments to deployment environments. To avoid confusion caused by
observations that are not relevant to the target task, we propose to explicitly
learn the causal relationship between observation components and expert
actions, employing a framework similar to [6], where a causal structural
function is learned by intervention on the imitation learning policy.
Disentangling the feature representation from image input as in [6] is hard to
satisfy in complex imitation learning process in robotic manipulation, we
theoretically clarify that this requirement is not necessary in causal
relationship learning. Therefore, we propose a simple causal structure learning
framework that can be easily embedded in recent imitation learning
architectures, such as the Action Chunking Transformer [31]. We demonstrate our
approach using a simulation of the ALOHA [31] bimanual robot arms in Mujoco,
and show that the method can considerably mitigate the generalization problem
of existing complex imitation learning algorithms.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上验证，显著提高了监控的可靠性，同时保持完整性。

Conclusion: 该方法为学习型自动驾驶系统提供了一种实用且可靠的安全监控方案。

Abstract: The advent of end-to-end autonomy stacks - often lacking interpretable
intermediate modules - has placed an increased burden on ensuring that the
final output, i.e., the motion plan, is safe in order to validate the safety of
the entire stack. This requires a safety monitor that is both complete (able to
detect all unsafe plans) and sound (does not flag safe plans). In this work, we
propose a principled safety monitor that leverages modern multi-modal
trajectory predictors to approximate forward reachable sets (FRS) of
surrounding agents. By formulating a convex program, we efficiently extract
these data-driven FRSs directly from the predicted state distributions,
conditioned on scene context such as lane topology and agent history. To ensure
completeness, we leverage conformal prediction to calibrate the FRS and
guarantee coverage of ground-truth trajectories with high probability. To
preserve soundness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios or under predictor
failure, we introduce a Bayesian filter that dynamically adjusts the FRS
conservativeness based on the predictor's observed performance. We then assess
the safety of the ego vehicle's motion plan by checking for intersections with
these calibrated FRSs, ensuring the plan remains collision-free under plausible
future behaviors of others. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset show
our approach significantly improves soundness while maintaining completeness,
offering a practical and reliable safety monitor for learned autonomy stacks.

Motivation: 为安全部署和操作ADS，需准确评估其处理真实交通场景的风险。传统PDF估计方法存在假设限制或维度灾难问题。

Method: 采用归一化流（NF）模型，通过可逆和可微映射从简单分布生成复杂PDF，避免对PDF形状的严格假设。

Result: NF在风险及风险不确定性量化上优于KDE，对维度灾难更鲁棒，但计算资源需求更高。

Conclusion: NF在场景化安全验证中潜力显著，未来可优化其架构和训练以提升适用性。

Abstract: The development of safety validation methods is essential for the safe
deployment and operation of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). One of the goals
of safety validation is to prospectively evaluate the risk of an ADS dealing
with real-world traffic. Scenario-based assessment is a widely-used approach,
where test cases are derived from real-world driving data. To allow for a
quantitative analysis of the system performance, the exposure of the scenarios
must be accurately estimated. The exposure of scenarios at parameter level is
expressed using a Probability Density Function (PDF). However, assumptions
about the PDF, such as parameter independence, can introduce errors, while
avoiding assumptions often leads to oversimplified models with limited
parameters to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.
  This paper considers the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating the PDF
of the parameters. NF are a class of generative models that transform a simple
base distribution into a complex one using a sequence of invertible and
differentiable mappings, enabling flexible, high-dimensional density estimation
without restrictive assumptions on the PDF's shape. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of NF in quantifying risk and risk uncertainty of an ADS,
comparing its performance with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a traditional
method for non-parametric PDF estimation. While NF require more computational
resources compared to KDE, NF is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality.
As a result, NF can improve risk uncertainty estimation, offering a more
precise assessment of an ADS's safety.
  This work illustrates the potential of NF in scenario-based safety. Future
work involves experimenting more with using NF for scenario generation and
optimizing the NF architecture, transformation types, and training
hyperparameters to further enhance their applicability.

additional steps must be taken to fully operationalize the NATM. In addition,
we will elaborate on how the use of scenario databases fits with methods
developed in the Horizon Europe projects that focus on safety assessment

Abstract: Land-air bimodal robots (LABR) are gaining attention for autonomous
navigation, combining high mobility from aerial vehicles with long endurance
from ground vehicles. However, existing LABR navigation methods are limited by
suboptimal trajectories from mapping-based approaches and the excessive
computational demands of learning-based methods. To address this, we propose a
two-stage lightweight framework that integrates global key points prediction
with local trajectory refinement to generate efficient and reachable
trajectories. In the first stage, the Global Key points Prediction Network
(GKPN) was used to generate a hybrid land-air keypoint path. The GKPN includes
a Sobel Perception Network (SPN) for improved obstacle detection and a
Lightweight Attention Planning Network (LAPN) to improves predictive ability by
capturing contextual information. In the second stage, the global path is
segmented based on predicted key points and refined using a mapping-based
planner to create smooth, collision-free trajectories. Experiments conducted on
our LABR platform show that our framework reduces network parameters by 14\%
and energy consumption during land-air transitions by 35\% compared to existing
approaches. The framework achieves real-time navigation without GPU
acceleration and enables zero-shot transfer from simulation to reality during

sequential probability ratio testing (SPRT). The anomaly detector processes
single image frames, providing interpretable spatial localisation of anomalies,
whilst the SPRT introduces temporal evidence aggregation, enhancing robustness
against noise over sequences of image frames. Experimental results demonstrate
improved anomaly detection performance, highlighting the benefits of the
combined spatiotemporal analysis system for reliable and robust sewer

Abstract: Developing controllers that generalize across diverse robot morphologies
remains a significant challenge in legged locomotion. Traditional approaches
either create specialized controllers for each morphology or compromise
performance for generality. This paper introduces a two-stage teacher-student
framework that bridges this gap through policy distillation. First, we train
specialized teacher policies optimized for individual morphologies, capturing
the unique optimal control strategies for each robot design. Then, we distill
this specialized expertise into a single Transformer-based student policy
capable of controlling robots with varying leg configurations. Our experiments
across five distinct legged morphologies demonstrate that our approach
preserves morphology-specific optimal behaviors, with the Transformer
architecture achieving 94.47\% of teacher performance on training morphologies
and 72.64\% on unseen robot designs. Comparative analysis reveals that
Transformer-based architectures consistently outperform MLP baselines by
leveraging attention mechanisms to effectively model joint relationships across
different kinematic structures. We validate our approach through successful
deployment on a physical quadruped robot, demonstrating the practical viability
of our morphology-agnostic control framework. This work presents a scalable
solution for developing universal legged robot controllers that maintain
near-optimal performance while generalizing across diverse morphologies.

Abstract: Rigorous Verification and Validation (V&V) of Autonomous Driving Functions
(ADFs) is paramount for ensuring the safety and public acceptance of Autonomous
Vehicles (AVs). Current validation relies heavily on simulation to achieve
sufficient test coverage within the Operational Design Domain (ODD) of a
vehicle, but exhaustively exploring the vast parameter space of possible
scenarios is computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work introduces
a framework based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) to accelerate the discovery of
critical scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework on an
Model Predictive Controller (MPC)-based motion planner, showing that it
identifies hazardous situations, such as off-road events, using orders of
magnitude fewer simulations than brute-force Design of Experiments (DoE)
methods. Furthermore, this study investigates the scalability of the framework
in higher-dimensional parameter spaces and its ability to identify multiple,
distinct critical regions within the ODD of the motion planner used as the case
study .

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is a widely adopted approach which enables agents to
learn from human expert demonstrations by framing the task as a supervised
learning problem. However, IL often suffers from causal confusion, where agents
misinterpret spurious correlations as causal relationships, leading to poor
performance in testing environments with distribution shift. To address this
issue, we introduce GAze-Based Regularization in Imitation Learning (GABRIL), a
novel method that leverages the human gaze data gathered during the data
collection phase to guide the representation learning in IL. GABRIL utilizes a
regularization loss which encourages the model to focus on causally relevant
features identified through expert gaze and consequently mitigates the effects
of confounding variables. We validate our approach in Atari environments and
the Bench2Drive benchmark in CARLA by collecting human gaze datasets and
applying our method in both domains. Experimental results show that the
improvement of GABRIL over behavior cloning is around 179% more than the same
number for other baselines in the Atari and 76% in the CARLA setup. Finally, we
show that our method provides extra explainability when compared to regular IL
agents.
