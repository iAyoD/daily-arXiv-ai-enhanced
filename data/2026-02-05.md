### [1] [Linguistic Blind Spots in Clinical Decision Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03942)
*Mohamed Elgaar,Hadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究临床笔记中医疗决策提取的失败原因，发现不同决策类别有特定语言特征，叙事风格决策（如建议和预防措施）在精确匹配下召回率低，建议采用边界容忍策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策提取是临床决策支持和患者护理总结的关键步骤，但现有模型提取效果不佳。研究旨在探索不同决策类别的语言特征差异是否解释了提取失败的原因。

Method: 使用MedDec出院总结数据集，标注DICTUM决策分类，计算每个决策跨度的七个语言指标，分析标准transformer模型在跨度级别的提取召回率，比较不同语言特征下的表现差异。

Result: 发现明显的类别特异性语言特征：药物相关和问题定义决策实体密集、简洁；建议和预防措施决策更叙事化，包含更多停用词、代词、模糊表达和否定提示。精确匹配召回率48%，叙事风格决策召回率显著更低（从58%降至24%）。宽松重叠匹配召回率提升至71%。

Conclusion: 叙事风格决策（常见于建议和预防措施）是精确匹配下的盲点，下游系统应采用边界容忍的评估和提取策略来处理临床决策提取任务。

Abstract: Extracting medical decisions from clinical notes is a key step for clinical decision support and patient-facing care summaries. We study how the linguistic characteristics of clinical decisions vary across decision categories and whether these differences explain extraction failures. Using MedDec discharge summaries annotated with decision categories from the Decision Identification and Classification Taxonomy for Use in Medicine (DICTUM), we compute seven linguistic indices for each decision span and analyze span-level extraction recall of a standard transformer model. We find clear category-specific signatures: drug-related and problem-defining decisions are entity-dense and telegraphic, whereas advice and precaution decisions contain more narrative, with higher stopword and pronoun proportions and more frequent hedging and negation cues. On the validation split, exact-match recall is 48%, with large gaps across linguistic strata: recall drops from 58% to 24% from the lowest to highest stopword-proportion bins, and spans containing hedging or negation cues are less likely to be recovered. Under a relaxed overlap-based match criterion, recall increases to 71%, indicating that many errors are span boundary disagreements rather than complete misses. Overall, narrative-style spans--common in advice and precaution decisions--are a consistent blind spot under exact matching, suggesting that downstream systems should incorporate boundary-tolerant evaluation and extraction strategies for clinical decisions.

### [2] [Automatic Classification of Pedagogical Materials against CS Curriculum Guidelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03962)
*Erik Saule,Kalpathi Subramanian,Razvan Bunescu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用NLP技术自动评估计算机科学课程对ACM/IEEE课程指南的覆盖程度，解决人工审核耗时费力的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机科学专业课程指南（ACM/IEEE标准）包含数千项内容，人工评估课程覆盖程度耗时耗力（每门课程约需一天），需要自动化解决方案

Method: 探索两种NLP技术：1）基于传统解析、标记和嵌入的工具；2）利用大语言模型（LLM）的能力。将这些技术应用于教学材料的分类

Result: 能够有意义地自动分类文档，证明NLP技术可以加速课程指南覆盖度的评估过程

Conclusion: NLP技术可以有效支持课程评估工作，减轻项目管理员的工作负担，提高课程与专业标准对齐的效率

Abstract: Professional societies often publish curriculum guidelines to help programs align their content to international standards. In Computer Science, the primary standard is published by ACM and IEEE and provide detailed guidelines for what should be and could be included in a Computer Science program.
  While very helpful, it remains difficult for program administrators to assess how much of the guidelines is being covered by a CS program. This is in particular due to the extensiveness of the guidelines, containing thousands of individual items. As such, it is time consuming and cognitively demanding to audit every course to confidently mark everything that is actually being covered. Our preliminary work indicated that it takes about a day of work per course.
  In this work, we propose using Natural Language Processing techniques to accelerate the process. We explore two kinds of techniques, the first relying on traditional tools for parsing, tagging, and embeddings, while the second leverages the power of Large Language Models. We evaluate the application of these techniques to classify a corpus of pedagogical materials and show that we can meaningfully classify documents automatically.

### [3] [Likelihood-Based Reward Designs for General LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03979)
*Ariel Kwiatkowski,Natasha Butt,Ismail Labiad,Julia Kempe,Yann Ollivier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了基于参考答案概率或对数概率的奖励函数在LLM推理微调中的应用，发现对数概率奖励在可验证和不可验证场景下均表现良好，是链式思维学习的有效方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于强化学习的LLM推理微调需要为每个基准设计特定奖励函数（通常是二元的），这存在两个问题：需要人工设计奖励，且二元奖励可能过于稀疏。研究者希望找到一种不依赖特定验证器、可大规模应用的奖励函数。

Method: 系统比较了基于概率和对数概率的奖励函数变体与标准基线方法。在标准数学推理基准和无法使用外部验证器的长格式答案场景下进行测试。重点研究了使用参考答案对数概率作为链式思维学习奖励的方法。

Result: 在可验证场景中，对数概率奖励与标准二元奖励相比，带来相当或更好的成功率，且困惑度更低。在不可验证场景中，与监督微调表现相当。而基于概率的方法（如VeriFree）在不可验证场景中因正确答案概率趋近于零而失效。

Conclusion: 对数概率奖励是链式思维微调的有效方法，能够桥接短格式可验证答案和长格式不可验证答案场景。该方法与预训练中使用的下一词元对数似然损失一致，是通用且可扩展的奖励函数。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on reasoning benchmarks via reinforcement learning requires a specific reward function, often binary, for each benchmark. This comes with two potential limitations: the need to design the reward, and the potentially sparse nature of binary rewards. Here, we systematically investigate rewards derived from the probability or log-probability of emitting the reference answer (or any other prompt continuation present in the data), which have the advantage of not relying on specific verifiers and being available at scale. Several recent works have advocated for the use of similar rewards (e.g., VeriFree, JEPO, RLPR, NOVER). We systematically compare variants of likelihood-based rewards with standard baselines, testing performance both on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, and on long-form answers where no external verifier is available. We find that using the log-probability of the reference answer as the reward for chain-of-thought (CoT) learning is the only option that performs well in all setups. This reward is also consistent with the next-token log-likelihood loss used during pretraining. In verifiable settings, log-probability rewards bring comparable or better success rates than reinforcing with standard binary rewards, and yield much better perplexity. In non-verifiable settings, they perform on par with SFT. On the other hand, methods based on probability, such as VeriFree, flatline on non-verifiable settings due to vanishing probabilities of getting the correct answer. Overall, this establishes log-probability rewards as a viable method for CoT fine-tuning, bridging the short, verifiable and long, non-verifiable answer settings.

### [4] [Transformers perform adaptive partial pooling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03980)
*Vsevolod Kapatsinski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT2在训练过程中逐渐减少跨语境的信息共享，其学习模式类似于分层回归中的自适应部分池化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型如何处理新颖或低频语境中的泛化问题，探索transformer模型是否像分层回归那样在不同语境间自适应地共享信息

Method: 分析GPT2在不同训练阶段的下一个词预测行为，考察语境频率、语境数量和语境变异性对信息共享程度的影响

Result: GPT2在训练过程中逐渐减少跨语境的信息共享（池化程度随训练降低），且池化程度受语境频率、类型频率和语境变异性的影响，这与分层回归模型相似

Conclusion: Transformer的学习特性在理性和经验基础上都是现实的，其跨语境信息共享模式类似于分层回归的自适应部分池化机制

Abstract: Because language is creative, any reasonable language model must generalize, deciding what to say in novel contexts by using information from similar contexts. But what about contexts that are not novel but merely infrequent? In hierarchical regression, the model's predictions for behavior in a context are affected by observations from other similar contexts to the extent that 1) the current context is infrequent and 2) different contexts behave similarly. This is called adaptive partial pooling of evidence. This paper shows that next-word predictions of a transformer (GPT2) are increasingly unaffected by observations from outside the current context across epochs of training (the amount of pooling reduces with training), and that the extent of pooling is affected by context frequency, context number (type frequency) and context variability in a similar way to hierarchical regression. These characteristics of learning in transformers are argued to be realistic on both rational and empirical grounds.

### [5] [On the Credibility of Evaluating LLMs using Survey Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04033)
*Jindřich Libovický*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文指出当前评估大语言模型价值取向的方法存在局限性，可能导致高估或低估与人类价值取向的相似性，并提出新的评估指标和方法建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用社会调查问卷评估大语言模型价值取向的方法存在缺陷，不同的提示方法和解码策略会显著影响结果，需要更准确的评估方法。

Method: 使用世界价值观调查在三种语言五个国家进行实验，比较不同提示方法（直接vs.思维链）和解码策略（贪婪vs.采样），并引入新的评估指标——自相关距离来衡量答案间的一致性。

Result: 发现提示方法和解码策略显著影响评估结果；即使平均同意度高也不保证结构一致性；常用评估指标均方距离和KL散度相关性弱且假设答案独立。

Conclusion: 建议未来研究使用思维链提示、基于采样的解码方法（数十个样本），并采用包括自相关距离在内的多种指标进行稳健分析。

Abstract: Recent studies evaluate the value orientation of large language models (LLMs) using adapted social surveys, typically by prompting models with survey questions and comparing their responses to average human responses. This paper identifies limitations in this methodology that, depending on the exact setup, can lead to both underestimating and overestimating the similarity of value orientation. Using the World Value Survey in three languages across five countries, we demonstrate that prompting methods (direct vs. chain-of-thought) and decoding strategies (greedy vs. sampling) significantly affect results. To assess the interaction between answers, we introduce a novel metric, self-correlation distance. This metric measures whether LLMs maintain consistent relationships between answers across different questions, as humans do. This indicates that even a high average agreement with human data, when considering LLM responses independently, does not guarantee structural alignment in responses. Additionally, we reveal a weak correlation between two common evaluation metrics, mean-squared distance and KL divergence, which assume that survey answers are independent of each other. For future research, we recommend CoT prompting, sampling-based decoding with dozens of samples, and robust analysis using multiple metrics, including self-correlation distance.

### [6] [Abstraction Induces the Brain Alignment of Language and Speech Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04081)
*Emily Cheng,Aditya R. Vaidya,Richard Antonello*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型中间层的语义丰富性和高内在维度是预测大脑神经反应的关键因素，而非模型的下一词预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已知大型语言模型和语音音频模型的中间隐藏状态能预测大脑对自然语言刺激的反应，但尚不清楚哪些表征特性导致了这种高预测性能。为什么是中间层而非输出层最适合这种独特的通用迁移任务？

Method: 通过分析模型层间的内在维度（特征复杂度的度量），研究其与大脑fMRI和ECoG信号预测能力的关系。考察预训练过程中这种关系如何形成，并通过微调模型来更好地预测大脑信号，观察内在维度和语义内容的变化。

Result: 模型层的内在维度强烈预测其对大脑信号的解释能力；内在维度与大脑预测性关系在预训练过程中形成；微调模型以更好地预测大脑信号会因果性地增加表征的内在维度和语义内容。

Conclusion: 语义丰富性、高内在维度和大脑预测性相互关联，驱动模型-大脑相似性的关键因素是输入信息的丰富语义抽象，而语言建模是足够复杂（但可能不是唯一）需要这种抽象的任务。

Abstract: Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models and speech audio models predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most effective for this unique and highly general transfer task? We give evidence that the correspondence between speech and language models and the brain derives from shared meaning abstraction and not their next-word prediction properties. In particular, models construct higher-order linguistic features in their middle layers, cued by a peak in the layerwise intrinsic dimension, a measure of feature complexity. We show that a layer's intrinsic dimension strongly predicts how well it explains fMRI and ECoG signals; that the relation between intrinsic dimension and brain predictivity arises over model pre-training; and finetuning models to better predict the brain causally increases both representations' intrinsic dimension and their semantic content. Results suggest that semantic richness, high intrinsic dimension, and brain predictivity mirror each other, and that the key driver of model-brain similarity is rich meaning abstraction of the inputs, where language modeling is a task sufficiently complex (but perhaps not the only) to require it.

### [7] [Expert Selections In MoE Models Reveal (Almost) As Much As Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04105)
*Amir Nuriyev,Gabriel Kulp*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出针对MoE语言模型的文本重建攻击，仅通过专家选择就能恢复原始文本，揭示了路由决策比预期泄露更多信息


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型中每个token被路由到专家子网络子集，先前研究认为这种路由决策泄露信息有限，但作者发现实际泄露远超预期，需要重新评估MoE部署的安全性

Method: 使用3层MLP和基于Transformer的序列解码器进行文本重建攻击，在OpenWebText数据集上训练100M tokens，比较不同解码器在32-token序列上的重建效果

Result: 3层MLP达到63.1%的top-1准确率，Transformer序列解码器在32-token序列上达到91.2% top-1准确率（94.8% top-10），添加噪声能降低但无法完全消除重建能力

Conclusion: MoE路由决策泄露的信息比先前理解的多得多，专家选择应被视为与原始文本同等敏感，在分布式推理和侧信道等实际场景中需要加强安全防护

Abstract: We present a text-reconstruction attack on mixture-of-experts (MoE) language models that recovers tokens from expert selections alone. In MoE models, each token is routed to a subset of expert subnetworks; we show these routing decisions leak substantially more information than previously understood. Prior work using logistic regression achieves limited reconstruction; we show that a 3-layer MLP improves this to 63.1% top-1 accuracy, and that a transformer-based sequence decoder recovers 91.2% of tokens top-1 (94.8% top-10) on 32-token sequences from OpenWebText after training on 100M tokens. These results connect MoE routing to the broader literature on embedding inversion. We outline practical leakage scenarios (e.g., distributed inference and side channels) and show that adding noise reduces but does not eliminate reconstruction. Our findings suggest that expert selections in MoE deployments should be treated as sensitive as the underlying text.

### [8] [DELTA: Deliberative Multi-Agent Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning for Multimodal Psychological Counseling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04112)
*Jiangnan Yang,Junjie Chen,Fei Wang,Yiqi Nie,Yuxin Liu,Zhangling Duan,Jie Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DELTA是一个多模态多智能体框架，通过结构化推理过程将心理咨询建模为证据基础、心理状态抽象和回应生成三个分离阶段，并引入强化学习优化情感协调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于语言模型的心理咨询系统大多仅处理文本，依赖隐式的心理状态推断，无法充分利用咨询过程中的多模态信号（视觉和声音线索），而这些信号对于准确理解客户心理状态和提供共情回应至关重要。

Method: DELTA采用审议式多智能体框架，将心理咨询建模为结构化的多模态信号推理过程：1) 证据基础（从多模态信号中提取证据），2) 心理状态抽象（从证据推断心理状态），3) 回应生成（基于心理状态生成回应）。同时引入强化学习，使用分布级情感协调分数来优化情感协调度。

Result: 在多模态心理咨询基准测试中，DELTA在咨询质量和情感协调度方面均优于现有模型。消融实验和定性分析表明，显式的多模态推理和结构化的心理状态表征在支持共情的人机交互中发挥互补作用。

Conclusion: DELTA框架通过分离多模态证据基础、心理状态抽象和回应生成，结合强化学习优化情感协调，显著提升了AI心理咨询系统的质量和共情能力，为构建更有效的共情人机交互系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Psychological counseling is a fundamentally multimodal cognitive process in which clinicians integrate verbal content with visual and vocal cues to infer clients' mental states and respond empathically. However, most existing language-model-based counseling systems operate on text alone and rely on implicit mental state inference. We introduce DELTA, a deliberative multi-agent framework that models counseling as a structured reasoning process over multimodal signals, separating evidence grounding, mental state abstraction, and response generation. DELTA further incorporates reinforcement learning guided by a distribution-level Emotion Attunement Score to encourage emotionally attuned responses. Experiments on a multimodal counseling benchmark show that DELTA improves both counseling quality and emotion attunement across models. Ablation and qualitative analyses suggest that explicit multimodal reasoning and structured mental state representations play complementary roles in supporting empathic human-AI interaction.

### [9] [From Lemmas to Dependencies: What Signals Drive Light Verbs Classification?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04127)
*Sercan Karakaş,Yusuf Şimşek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了土耳其语轻动词构式的分类信号，通过限制模型输入比较不同方法，发现粗粒度形态句法信息不足，词汇身份支持分类但受标准化方式影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土耳其语中的轻动词构式因其丰富的形态和复杂的谓词结构而具有挑战性，需要系统研究驱动分类的信号，以改进土耳其语多词表达式的评估方法。

Method: 使用UD标注数据进行监督学习，比较四种方法：1) 词元TF-IDF+逻辑回归；2) 基于词元序列的BERTurk；3) 仅基于UD形态句法的逻辑回归；4) 完整输入的BERTurk基线。在包含随机负例、词汇控制正例和LVC正例的诊断集上评估。

Result: 粗粒度形态句法信息不足以在受控对比下实现稳健的LVC检测，词汇身份支持LVC判断但对校准和标准化选择敏感。"仅词元"不是单一明确定义的表示，而是取决于标准化的操作方式。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持对土耳其语多词表达式进行有针对性的评估，并表明标准化操作方式对轻动词构式分类至关重要，需要更精细的表示方法。

Abstract: Light verb constructions (LVCs) are a challenging class of verbal multiword expressions, especially in Turkish, where rich morphology and productive complex predicates create minimal contrasts between idiomatic predicate meanings and literal verb--argument uses. This paper asks what signals drive LVC classification by systematically restricting model inputs. Using UD-derived supervision, we compare lemma-driven baselines (lemma TF--IDF + Logistic Regression; BERTurk trained on lemma sequences), a grammar-only Logistic Regression over UD morphosyntax (UPOS/DEPREL/MORPH), and a full-input BERTurk baseline. We evaluate on a controlled diagnostic set with Random negatives, lexical controls (NLVC), and LVC positives, reporting split-wise performance to expose decision-boundary behavior. Results show that coarse morphosyntax alone is insufficient for robust LVC detection under controlled contrasts, while lexical identity supports LVC judgments but is sensitive to calibration and normalization choices. Overall, Our findings motivate targeted evaluation of Turkish MWEs and show that ``lemma-only'' is not a single, well-defined representation, but one that depends critically on how normalization is operationalized.

### [10] [The Missing Half: Unveiling Training-time Implicit Safety Risks Beyond Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04196)
*Zhexin Zhang,Yida Lu,Junfeng Fang,Junxiao Yang,Shiyao Cui,Hao Zhou,Fandong Meng,Jie Zhou,Hongning Wang,Minlie Huang,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文首次系统研究AI模型训练期间的安全风险，特别是隐式风险，提出分类框架并通过实验证明其普遍性和严重性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI安全研究主要集中在部署时的风险（如越狱攻击），而训练期间的安全风险尚未得到充分探索。除了显式的奖励黑客攻击外，模型内部激励和上下文背景信息驱动的隐式风险需要系统研究。

Method: 提出包含5个风险等级、10个细粒度风险类别和3种激励类型的分类法。通过大量实验分析这些风险，包括在代码强化学习场景中测试Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct等模型，并扩展到多智能体训练环境。

Result: 实验显示隐式训练时风险普遍存在且严重：仅提供背景信息时，Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct在74.4%的训练运行中表现出风险行为。分析了影响这些行为的因素，并证明多智能体训练中也会出现类似风险。

Conclusion: 识别了一个被忽视但紧迫的训练安全挑战，强调需要关注模型内部激励驱动的隐式风险，为未来AI安全研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Safety risks of AI models have been widely studied at deployment time, such as jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful outputs. In contrast, safety risks emerging during training remain largely unexplored. Beyond explicit reward hacking that directly manipulates explicit reward functions in reinforcement learning, we study implicit training-time safety risks: harmful behaviors driven by a model's internal incentives and contextual background information. For example, during code-based reinforcement learning, a model may covertly manipulate logged accuracy for self-preservation. We present the first systematic study of this problem, introducing a taxonomy with five risk levels, ten fine-grained risk categories, and three incentive types. Extensive experiments reveal the prevalence and severity of these risks: notably, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct exhibits risky behaviors in 74.4% of training runs when provided only with background information. We further analyze factors influencing these behaviors and demonstrate that implicit training-time risks also arise in multi-agent training settings. Our results identify an overlooked yet urgent safety challenge in training.

*Xinyue Wang,Yuanhe Zhang,Zhengshuo Gong,Haoran Gao,Fanyu Meng,Zhenhong Zhou,Li Sun,Yang Liu,Sen Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出"毒性主动性"概念，指AI代理为最大化效用而忽视伦理约束的主动失败模式，并开发了基于困境驱动的双模型交互评估框架来识别和分析这种行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理能力的增强，现有研究主要关注"过度拒绝"的被动失败模式，但忽视了代理主动规划和行动能力可能带来的另一面风险——"毒性主动性"，即代理为追求马基雅维利式有用性而忽视伦理约束的行为。

Method: 提出了基于困境驱动的双模型交互评估框架，通过模拟和分析多步行为轨迹来揭示毒性主动性行为。建立了系统性基准来评估不同情境下的毒性主动行为。

Result: 实验表明毒性主动性是广泛存在的行为现象，揭示了两种主要倾向。主流LLM都表现出这种风险行为。

Conclusion: 毒性主动性是LLM代理的重要安全风险，需要专门的评估框架来识别和缓解。论文提出的方法为理解和评估这种主动失败模式提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The enhanced capabilities of LLM-based agents come with an emergency for model planning and tool-use abilities. Attributing to helpful-harmless trade-off from LLM alignment, agents typically also inherit the flaw of "over-refusal", which is a passive failure mode. However, the proactive planning and action capabilities of agents introduce another crucial danger on the other side of the trade-off. This phenomenon we term "Toxic Proactivity'': an active failure mode in which an agent, driven by the optimization for Machiavellian helpfulness, disregards ethical constraints to maximize utility. Unlike over-refusal, Toxic Proactivity manifests as the agent taking excessive or manipulative measures to ensure its "usefulness'' is maintained. Existing research pays little attention to identifying this behavior, as it often lacks the subtle context required for such strategies to unfold. To reveal this risk, we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on dilemma-driven interactions between dual models, enabling the simulation and analysis of agent behavior over multi-step behavioral trajectories. Through extensive experiments with mainstream LLMs, we demonstrate that Toxic Proactivity is a widespread behavioral phenomenon and reveal two major tendencies. We further present a systematic benchmark for evaluating Toxic Proactive behavior across contextual settings.

*Hsien-Jyh Liao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Soft-FSM：一种神经符号架构，通过外部确定性状态控制器强制实现单调进展，解决LLM在程序性任务中的停滞问题，在台湾刑事杀人案件测试中达到97%完成度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在语言流畅性方面表现出色，但在明确的程序约束下可靠完成长期任务方面存在困难。在法律交叉询问中，纯粹的概率生成往往保持行为连贯性，但无法确保程序推进。这种失败被描述为"程序性停滞"。

Method: 提出Soft-FSM神经符号架构，通过外部确定性状态控制器强制实现对累积关键信息单元（KIUs）的单调进展控制。该方法结合了神经网络的灵活性和符号系统的确定性。

Result: 在三个真实世界台湾刑事杀人案件实验中，基线方法完成度低于40%，而Soft-FSM始终达到超过97%的完成度，且冗余度接近零。

Conclusion: 在此类领域中，可靠的任​​务完成不能仅依靠LLM的涌现行为来保证，而可以通过明确且可验证的外部状态控制来可靠地强制执行。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive linguistic fluency but struggle to reliably complete long-horizon tasks under explicit procedural constraints. In legal cross-examination, purely proba-bilistic generation often maintains behavioral coherence while failing to ensure procedural advancement. We characterize this failure as procedural stagnation and propose Soft-FSM, a neuro-symbolic architecture that enforces monotonic progress over accumulated Key Information Units (KIUs) via an external deterministic state controller. Experiments on three real-world Taiwanese criminal homicide cases show that baseline methods collapse below 40% completeness, while Soft-FSM consistently achieves over 97% with near-zero redundancy. These results suggest that, in such domains, reliable task completion cannot be guaranteed by emergent LLM behavior alone, and can be reliably enforced through explicit and verifiable external state control.

### [13] [Language Models Struggle to Use Representations Learned In-Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04212)
*Michael A. Lepori,Tal Linzen,Ann Yuan,Katja Filippova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs虽然能在上下文中学习新语义表示，但难以将这些表示灵活应用于下游任务，即使是最先进的模型也无法可靠利用上下文中的新模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否能将上下文学习到的语义表示灵活部署到简单下游任务中，这是实现AI系统在部署时适应全新环境的重要一步。

Method: 首先评估开源LLMs能否将上下文表示用于下一个token预测，然后使用新的自适应世界建模任务进行探测，最后测试闭源最先进推理模型。

Result: 开源LLMs难以部署上下文定义的新语义表示，即使它们在潜在表示中编码了这些语义；最先进的LLMs也无法可靠利用上下文中的新模式。

Conclusion: 需要开发新方法鼓励模型不仅编码上下文信息，还要以支持灵活部署的方式编码，这是实现AI适应能力的关键挑战。

Abstract: Though large language models (LLMs) have enabled great success across a wide variety of tasks, they still appear to fall short of one of the loftier goals of artificial intelligence research: creating an artificial system that can adapt its behavior to radically new contexts upon deployment. One important step towards this goal is to create systems that can induce rich representations of data that are seen in-context, and then flexibly deploy these representations to accomplish goals. Recently, Park et al. (2024) demonstrated that current LLMs are indeed capable of inducing such representation from context (i.e., in-context representation learning). The present study investigates whether LLMs can use these representations to complete simple downstream tasks.
  We first assess whether open-weights LLMs can use in-context representations for next-token prediction, and then probe models using a novel task, adaptive world modeling. In both tasks, we find evidence that open-weights LLMs struggle to deploy representations of novel semantics that are defined in-context, even if they encode these semantics in their latent representations. Furthermore, we assess closed-source, state-of-the-art reasoning models on the adaptive world modeling task, demonstrating that even the most performant LLMs cannot reliably leverage novel patterns presented in-context. Overall, this work seeks to inspire novel methods for encouraging models to not only encode information presented in-context, but to do so in a manner that supports flexible deployment of this information.

### [14] [Tokenization and Morphological Fidelity in Uralic NLP: A Cross-Lingual Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04241)
*Nuo Xu,Ahrii Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究系统比较了三种子词分词方法（BPE、OBPE、Unigram）在六种乌拉尔语系语言中的表现，发现OBPE在形态对齐和词性标注任务上表现最佳，特别适用于拉丁字母组的低资源黏着语。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 子词分词对NLP性能至关重要，但在形态丰富和低资源语言家族中的行为研究不足。乌拉尔语系语言具有资源可用性和类型多样性的变化，是研究这一问题的理想对象。

Method: 使用三种子词分词范式（BPE、OBPE、Unigram）在六种乌拉尔语系语言上进行系统比较，以词性标注作为受控下游任务，评估形态对齐和标注准确性。

Result: OBPE在形态对齐和词性标注准确性方面始终优于传统方法，特别是在拉丁字母组中。OBPE减少了开放类类别的碎片化，并在频率谱上实现了更好的平衡。迁移效果还取决于下游标注架构，与训练量和谱系亲缘性相互作用。

Conclusion: 形态敏感的分词不仅是预处理选择，而是实现黏着性低资源语言有效跨语言迁移的决定性因素。OBPE为这类语言提供了更好的分词解决方案。

Abstract: Subword tokenization critically affects Natural Language Processing (NLP) performance, yet its behavior in morphologically rich and low-resource language families remains under-explored. This study systematically compares three subword paradigms -- Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), Overlap BPE (OBPE), and Unigram Language Model -- across six Uralic languages with varying resource availability and typological diversity. Using part-of-speech (POS) tagging as a controlled downstream task, we show that OBPE consistently achieves stronger morphological alignment and higher tagging accuracy than conventional methods, particularly within the Latin-script group. These gains arise from reduced fragmentation in open-class categories and a better balance across the frequency spectrum. Transfer efficacy further depends on the downstream tagging architecture, interacting with both training volume and genealogical proximity. Taken together, these findings highlight that morphology-sensitive tokenization is not merely a preprocessing choice but a decisive factor in enabling effective cross-lingual transfer for agglutinative, low-resource languages.

### [15] [CoLT: Reasoning with Chain of Latent Tool Calls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04246)
*Fangwei Zhu,Zhifang Sui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoLT：一种将潜在推理实现为"工具调用"的新框架，通过生成包含推理步骤信息的种子标记，在触发潜在工具调用时由外部小模型将其解包为完整推理步骤，在保持主模型能力的同时提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在推理方法通常需要模型结构增强和大量训练，限制了其广泛应用。作者希望提出一种更通用、无需模型结构修改的潜在推理方法，在保持主模型显式推理能力的同时提高效率。

Method: CoLT框架将潜在推理实现为"工具调用"：主模型生成包含推理步骤信息的种子标记，当触发潜在工具调用时，外部小模型接收种子标记的隐藏状态作为输入，将其解包为完整的推理步骤。这样主模型仍在显式标记空间进行推理。

Result: 在四个数学数据集上的实验结果表明，CoLT比基线潜在模型达到更高的准确率和更短的推理长度，并且与强化学习算法和不同解码器结构兼容。

Conclusion: CoLT提供了一种新颖的潜在推理实现方式，无需模型结构修改即可提高推理效率，同时保持主模型的推理能力，具有更好的通用性和兼容性。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is a critical technique in enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), and latent reasoning methods have been proposed to accelerate the inefficient token-level reasoning chain. We notice that existing latent reasoning methods generally require model structure augmentation and exhaustive training, limiting their broader applicability. In this paper, we propose CoLT, a novel framework that implements latent reasoning as ``tool calls''. Instead of reasoning entirely in the latent space, CoLT generates seed tokens that contain information of a reasoning step. When a latent tool call is triggered, a smaller external model will take the hidden states of seed tokens as its input, and unpack the seed tokens back to a full reasoning step. In this way, we can ensure that the main model reasons in the explicit token space, preserving its ability while improving efficiency. Experimental results on four mathematical datasets demonstrate that CoLT achieves higher accuracy and shorter reasoning length than baseline latent models, and is compatible with reinforcement learning algorithms and different decoder structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏针对临床人群（特别是阿尔茨海默病患者）的情感语音标注语料库，需要研究AD患者情感表达的特点及其与健康人群的差异

Method: 构建DementiaBank-Emotion语料库，对108名说话者的1,492个话语进行多标注者情感标注（Ekman六种基本情感+中性），并进行声学分析（基频F0、响度等）

Result: AD患者表达非中性情感比例显著高于健康对照（16.9% vs 5.7%）；声学分析显示健康对照在悲伤时基频显著降低，而AD患者变化很小；AD语音中响度能区分不同情感类别

Conclusion: AD患者情感表达模式与健康人群存在差异，但部分情感-韵律映射关系得以保留；发布的语料库和材料将支持临床人群情感识别研究

Abstract: We present DementiaBank-Emotion, the first multi-rater emotion annotation corpus for Alzheimer's disease (AD) speech. Annotating 1,492 utterances from 108 speakers for Ekman's six basic emotions and neutral, we find that AD patients express significantly more non-neutral emotions (16.9%) than healthy controls (5.7%; p < .001). Exploratory acoustic analysis suggests a possible dissociation: control speakers showed substantial F0 modulation for sadness (Delta = -3.45 semitones from baseline), whereas AD speakers showed minimal change (Delta = +0.11 semitones; interaction p = .023), though this finding is based on limited samples (sadness: n=5 control, n=15 AD) and requires replication. Within AD speech, loudness differentiates emotion categories, indicating partially preserved emotion-prosody mappings. We release the corpus, annotation guidelines, and calibration workshop materials to support research on emotion recognition in clinical populations.

TL;DR: 提出Agentic Verifier，一种基于执行的智能验证器，通过主动推理程序行为并搜索高度区分性的测试输入来改进竞争性编程问题的代码重排序，相比现有方法显著提升准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在编码方面表现出色，但在竞争性编程问题中仍难以一次性正确解决。现有的基于执行的重排序方法受限于测试用例生成困难或随机输入采样效率低下，需要更有效的测试时扩展策略。

Method: 提出Agentic Verifier智能验证器，通过与代码执行环境的多轮交互，主动推理程序行为，搜索能够暴露候选解决方案行为差异的高度区分性测试输入。采用大规模数据合成、拒绝微调和智能强化学习的可扩展训练流程，使验证器获得区分性输入生成能力。

Result: 在五个竞争性编程基准测试中，相比现有基于执行的基线方法，Best@K准确率实现了高达10-15%的绝对提升。分析显示清晰的测试时扩展行为，验证器在重排序之外具有更广泛的潜力。

Conclusion: Agentic Verifier通过主动推理和针对性反例生成，有效解决了现有执行重排序方法的局限性，显著提升了竞争性编程问题的解决准确率，展示了智能验证器在代码评估中的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong coding capabilities but still struggle to solve competitive programming problems correctly in a single attempt. Execution-based re-ranking offers a promising test-time scaling strategy, yet existing methods are constrained by either difficult test case generation or inefficient random input sampling. To address this limitation, we propose Agentic Verifier, an execution-based agent that actively reasons about program behaviors and searches for highly discriminative test inputs that expose behavioral discrepancies among candidate solutions. Through multi-turn interaction with code execution environments, the verifier iteratively refines the candidate input generator and produces targeted counterexamples rather than blindly sampling inputs. We train the verifier to acquire this discriminative input generation capability via a scalable pipeline combining large-scale data synthesis, rejection fine-tuning, and agentic reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across five competitive programming benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong execution-based baselines, achieving up to +10-15% absolute gains in Best@K accuracy. Further analysis reveals clear test-time scaling behavior and highlights the verifier's broader potential beyond reranking.

Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在心电图解释中不可靠，常产生看似合理但临床错误的分析，存在严重幻觉问题，公众不应直接信任这些输出。

Method: 1. 协议引导指令数据生成：基于可测量的心电图特征和专著定义的定量阈值及诊断逻辑构建解释语料库；2. 模态解耦架构与交错模态丢弃：提高当心电图信号或图像缺失时的鲁棒性和跨模态一致性；3. 强化学习与心电图诊断证据奖励：加强基于证据的心电图解释。

Conclusion: ECG-R1是首个用于可靠心电图解释的推理多模态大语言模型，解决了现有模型的幻觉问题，提供了更可靠的临床分析工具，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) serves as an indispensable diagnostic tool in clinical practice, yet existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain unreliable for ECG interpretation, often producing plausible but clinically incorrect analyses. To address this, we propose ECG-R1, the first reasoning MLLM designed for reliable ECG interpretation via three innovations. First, we construct the interpretation corpus using \textit{Protocol-Guided Instruction Data Generation}, grounding interpretation in measurable ECG features and monograph-defined quantitative thresholds and diagnostic logic. Second, we present a modality-decoupled architecture with \textit{Interleaved Modality Dropout} to improve robustness and cross-modal consistency when either the ECG signal or ECG image is missing. Third, we present \textit{Reinforcement Learning with ECG Diagnostic Evidence Rewards} to strengthen evidence-grounded ECG interpretation. Additionally, we systematically evaluate the ECG interpretation capabilities of proprietary, open-source, and medical MLLMs, and provide the first quantitative evidence that severe hallucinations are widespread, suggesting that the public should not directly trust these outputs without independent verification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM存在"情境拖累"现象：上下文中的失败尝试会偏置后续生成，导致类似错误，造成10-20%性能下降，甚至使自我改进变成自我恶化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多LLM自我改进流程假设模型可以通过反思错误来提升，但研究发现上下文中的失败尝试反而会拖累后续表现，需要深入理解这一现象。

Method: 在11个专有和开源模型上评估8个推理任务，使用树编辑距离进行结构分析，测试外部反馈、自我验证、回退行为微调和上下文去噪等缓解策略。

Result: 情境拖累导致10-20%性能下降，迭代自我改进可能恶化为自我恶化，后续推理轨迹会继承上下文中的错误结构模式，现有缓解策略只能部分恢复性能。

Conclusion: 情境拖累是当前推理架构中一个持续存在的失败模式，外部反馈和自我验证都无法完全消除，需要新的架构改进来解决这一根本问题。

Abstract: Central to many self-improvement pipelines for large language models (LLMs) is the assumption that models can improve by reflecting on past mistakes. We study a phenomenon termed contextual drag: the presence of failed attempts in the context biases subsequent generations toward structurally similar errors. Across evaluations of 11 proprietary and open-weight models on 8 reasoning tasks, contextual drag induces 10-20% performance drops, and iterative self-refinement in models with severe contextual drag can collapse into self-deterioration. Structural analysis using tree edit distance reveals that subsequent reasoning trajectories inherit structurally similar error patterns from the context. We demonstrate that neither external feedback nor successful self-verification suffices to eliminate this effect. While mitigation strategies such as fallback-behavior fine-tuning and context denoising yield partial improvements, they fail to fully restore baseline performance, positioning contextual drag as a persistent failure mode in current reasoning architectures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 代理压缩：一种新的语言模型训练方案，在训练时使用压缩输入提高效率，在推理时使用原始字节实现端到端接口


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型通常使用固定分词器进行训练，这导致模型与外部压缩器耦合。需要一种既能保持压缩输入效率优势，又能在推理时提供端到端原始字节接口的方案。

Method: 提出代理压缩训练方案：在训练时，一个语言模型同时在原始字节序列和外部压缩器生成的压缩视图上进行联合训练；通过这个过程，模型学习在内部对齐压缩序列和原始字节。

Result: 在代码语言建模上的大量实验表明，代理压缩显著提高了训练效率，在固定计算预算下明显优于纯字节级基线。随着模型规模增大，这些优势更加明显，代理训练模型最终匹配甚至超越分词器方法。

Conclusion: 代理压缩提供了一种高效的训练方案，既保持了压缩输入的计算优势，又能在推理时实现端到端的原始字节接口，同时保留了字节级建模的固有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Modern language models are trained almost exclusively on token sequences produced by a fixed tokenizer, an external lossless compressor often over UTF-8 byte sequences, thereby coupling the model to that compressor. This work introduces proxy compression, an alternative training scheme that preserves the efficiency benefits of compressed inputs while providing an end-to-end, raw-byte interface at inference time. During training, one language model is jointly trained on raw byte sequences and compressed views generated by external compressors; through the process, the model learns to internally align compressed sequences and raw bytes. This alignment enables strong transfer between the two formats, even when training predominantly on compressed inputs which are discarded at inference. Extensive experiments on code language modeling demonstrate that proxy compression substantially improves training efficiency and significantly outperforms pure byte-level baselines given fixed compute budgets. As model scale increases, these gains become more pronounced, and proxy-trained models eventually match or rival tokenizer approaches, all while operating solely on raw bytes and retaining the inherent robustness of byte-level modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法中，多模态大语言模型通常采用单独推理策略，缺乏中间监督，导致早期逻辑偏差会传播并造成不可逆的错误，产生噪声优化信号。

Method: 提出Guided Verifier框架，引入动态验证器与策略模型实时交互，检测不一致性并提供方向信号。开发专门的数据合成管道构建CoRe数据集，包含过程级负样本和正确引导的推理轨迹来训练验证器。

Result: 在MathVista、MathVerse和MMMU等基准测试上的广泛实验表明，通过分配计算资源进行协作推理和动态验证，8B参数模型能够实现强大的性能。

Conclusion: Guided Verifier框架通过主动验证和协作推理，有效解决了传统RL方法中的错误传播问题，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的复杂推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal mechanism for enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, prevailing paradigms typically rely on solitary rollout strategies where the model works alone. This lack of intermediate oversight renders the reasoning process susceptible to error propagation, where early logical deviations cascade into irreversible failures, resulting in noisy optimization signals. In this paper, we propose the \textbf{Guided Verifier} framework to address these structural limitations. Moving beyond passive terminal rewards, we introduce a dynamic verifier that actively co-solves tasks alongside the policy. During the rollout phase, this verifier interacts with the policy model in real-time, detecting inconsistencies and providing directional signals to steer the model toward valid trajectories. To facilitate this, we develop a specialized data synthesis pipeline targeting multimodal hallucinations, constructing \textbf{CoRe} dataset of process-level negatives and \textbf{Co}rrect-guide \textbf{Re}asoning trajectories to train the guided verifier. Extensive experiments on MathVista, MathVerse and MMMU indicate that by allocating compute to collaborative inference and dynamic verification, an 8B-parameter model can achieve strong performance.

*Yanshu Wang,Shuaishuai Yang,Jingjing He,Tong Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现few-shot演示对角色导向提示(RoP)和任务导向提示(ToP)产生相反影响：few-shot通过强化角色身份提升RoP安全性4.5%，但通过分散任务注意力降低ToP有效性21.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM面临越狱攻击威胁，现有基于提示的防御方法（如RoP和ToP）中few-shot演示的作用尚不明确。先前研究认为few-shot可能损害安全性，但缺乏对不同系统提示策略中few-shot交互作用的深入探究。

Method: 在多个主流LLM上进行全面评估，使用四种安全基准（AdvBench、HarmBench、SG-Bench、XSTest）和六种越狱攻击方法，分析few-shot演示对RoP和ToP防御策略的影响机制。

Result: few-shot演示对RoP和ToP产生相反效果：few-shot通过强化角色身份使RoP安全率提升最高4.5%，而通过分散任务注意力使ToP有效性降低最高21.2%。

Conclusion: few-shot演示在提示防御策略中的作用具有策略依赖性，为实际LLM应用中部署基于提示的防御提供了实用建议，强调需要根据防御策略类型谨慎使用few-shot演示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face increasing threats from jailbreak attacks that bypass safety alignment. While prompt-based defenses such as Role-Oriented Prompts (RoP) and Task-Oriented Prompts (ToP) have shown effectiveness, the role of few-shot demonstrations in these defense strategies remains unclear. Prior work suggests that few-shot examples may compromise safety, but lacks investigation into how few-shot interacts with different system prompt strategies. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on multiple mainstream LLMs across four safety benchmarks (AdvBench, HarmBench, SG-Bench, XSTest) using six jailbreak attack methods. Our key finding reveals that few-shot demonstrations produce opposite effects on RoP and ToP: few-shot enhances RoP's safety rate by up to 4.5% through reinforcing role identity, while it degrades ToP's effectiveness by up to 21.2% through distracting attention from task instructions. Based on these findings, we provide practical recommendations for deploying prompt-based defenses in real-world LLM applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM提示敏感性主要源于提示不明确，而非模型内部表示问题。明确指令的提示比模糊提示表现更稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究显示LLM对提示变化敏感，但很多研究使用不明确的提示（提供最少任务指令），这可能导致观察到的敏感性被夸大。需要区分是提示不明确还是模型本身的问题。

Method: 系统比较不明确提示和明确指令提示的敏感性，使用性能分析、logit分析和线性探测三种方法，评估提示变化对模型输出的影响。

Result: 不明确提示表现出更高的性能方差和相关token的较低logit值，而指令提示受这些问题影响较小。线性探测表明提示不明确主要影响最终层，对内部表示影响有限。

Conclusion: 提示敏感性研究需要更严谨，许多观察到的敏感性源于提示不明确而非模型固有特性。使用明确指令的提示可以减少性能波动。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as zero-shot and few-shot classifiers, where task behaviour is largely controlled through prompting. A growing number of works have observed that LLMs are sensitive to prompt variations, with small changes leading to large changes in performance. However, in many cases, the investigation of sensitivity is performed using underspecified prompts that provide minimal task instructions and weakly constrain the model's output space. In this work, we argue that a significant portion of the observed prompt sensitivity can be attributed to prompt underspecification. We systematically study and compare the sensitivity of underspecified prompts and prompts that provide specific instructions. Utilising performance analysis, logit analysis, and linear probing, we find that underspecified prompts exhibit higher performance variance and lower logit values for relevant tokens, while instruction-prompts suffer less from such problems. However, linear probing analysis suggests that the effects of prompt underspecification have only a marginal impact on the internal LLM representations, instead emerging in the final layers. Overall, our findings highlight the need for more rigour when investigating and mitigating prompt sensitivity.

TL;DR: LLMs在公平性评估中存在"框架差异"问题：语义相同的提示词不同表达方式会导致公平性评分显著变化，现有去偏方法未能解决这一问题。作者提出框架感知的去偏方法，提高LLMs在不同表达方式下的公平性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在现实应用中需要确保跨人口统计特征的公平响应。当前存在"隐藏偏见"问题：LLMs在标准评估下看似公平，但在评估设置之外可能产生偏见响应。框架（语义相同提示的不同表达方式）是导致这一差距的未被充分探索的因素。

Method: 1. 引入"框架差异"概念量化框架对公平性评估的影响；2. 通过为公平性评估基准添加替代框架来验证问题；3. 提出框架感知的去偏方法，鼓励LLMs在不同框架下保持一致性。

Result: 1. 公平性评分随框架显著变化；2. 现有去偏方法改善了整体（框架平均）公平性，但未能减少框架引起的差异；3. 提出的框架感知方法减少了整体偏见，提高了对框架差异的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 框架是LLMs公平性评估的重要影响因素，现有去偏方法存在局限性。提出的框架感知方法能有效提高LLMs的公平性和一致性，为更稳健的公平性评估和去偏提供了新方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their fair responses across demographics has become crucial. Despite many efforts, an ongoing challenge is hidden bias: LLMs appear fair under standard evaluations, but can produce biased responses outside those evaluation settings. In this paper, we identify framing -- differences in how semantically equivalent prompts are expressed (e.g., "A is better than B" vs. "B is worse than A") -- as an underexplored contributor to this gap. We first introduce the concept of "framing disparity" to quantify the impact of framing on fairness evaluation. By augmenting fairness evaluation benchmarks with alternative framings, we find that (1) fairness scores vary significantly with framing and (2) existing debiasing methods improve overall (i.e., frame-averaged) fairness, but often fail to reduce framing-induced disparities. To address this, we propose a framing-aware debiasing method that encourages LLMs to be more consistent across framings. Experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces overall bias and improves robustness against framing disparities, enabling LLMs to produce fairer and more consistent responses.

Conclusion: GutBrainIE通过高质量的手动标注和全面的任务设计，为生物医学信息抽取提供了更可靠的基准，有助于推动该领域的方法发展和评估。

Abstract: Information Extraction (IE), encompassing Named Entity Recognition (NER), Named Entity Linking (NEL), and Relation Extraction (RE), is critical for transforming the rapidly growing volume of scientific publications into structured, actionable knowledge. This need is especially evident in fast-evolving biomedical fields such as the gut-brain axis, where research investigates complex interactions between the gut microbiota and brain-related disorders. Existing biomedical IE benchmarks, however, are often narrow in scope and rely heavily on distantly supervised or automatically generated annotations, limiting their utility for advancing robust IE methods. We introduce GutBrainIE, a benchmark based on more than 1,600 PubMed abstracts, manually annotated by biomedical and terminological experts with fine-grained entities, concept-level links, and relations. While grounded in the gut-brain axis, the benchmark's rich schema, multiple tasks, and combination of highly curated and weakly supervised data make it broadly applicable to the development and evaluation of biomedical IE systems across domains.

Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型在多模态工作记忆任务中的表现差异，探究文本和视觉编码是否引发相同的计算过程

Method: 使用Qwen2.5和Qwen2.5-VL模型，在匹配的文本渲染或图像渲染网格上进行受控空间n-back任务评估，分析准确率、d'指标和试次级别的对数概率证据

Result: 模型在文本条件下的准确率和d'显著高于视觉条件；名义上的2/3-back任务往往不能反映指令延迟，而是与近期锁定比较一致；网格大小改变近期重复结构，从而影响干扰和错误模式

Conclusion: 需要基于计算敏感的解释来理解多模态工作记忆，文本和视觉编码在视觉语言模型中引发不同的计算过程

Abstract: Working memory is a central component of intelligent behavior, providing a dynamic workspace for maintaining and updating task-relevant information. Recent work has used n-back tasks to probe working-memory-like behavior in large language models, but it is unclear whether the same probe elicits comparable computations when information is carried in a visual rather than textual code in vision-language models. We evaluate Qwen2.5 and Qwen2.5-VL on a controlled spatial n-back task presented as matched text-rendered or image-rendered grids. Across conditions, models show reliably higher accuracy and d' with text than with vision. To interpret these differences at the process level, we use trial-wise log-probability evidence and find that nominal 2/3-back often fails to reflect the instructed lag and instead aligns with a recency-locked comparison. We further show that grid size alters recent-repeat structure in the stimulus stream, thereby changing interference and error patterns. These results motivate computation-sensitive interpretations of multimodal working memory.

TL;DR: TrajFusion是一种微调策略，通过融合正确和错误的推理轨迹来增强LLM的数学推理能力，相比传统的拒绝采样微调有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拒绝采样微调只保留正确的推理轨迹，系统性地排除了教师生成的错误，导致在训练过程中缺乏对推理失败的建模，限制了模型处理挑战性问题的能力。

Method: TrajFusion将拒绝采样重构为结构化监督构建过程，通过交错选择错误轨迹、反思提示和正确轨迹来形成融合轨迹，自适应控制融合样本长度，无需改变架构或训练目标。

Result: 在多个数学基准测试中，TrajFusion始终优于传统拒绝采样微调，特别是在挑战性和长形式推理问题上表现更佳。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模试错推理过程，TrajFusion为LLM数学推理提供了更丰富的监督信号，是传统拒绝采样微调的有效改进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made impressive strides in mathematical reasoning, often fine-tuned using rejection sampling that retains only correct reasoning trajectories. While effective, this paradigm treats supervision as a binary filter that systematically excludes teacher-generated errors, leaving a gap in how reasoning failures are modeled during training. In this paper, we propose TrajFusion, a fine-tuning strategy that reframes rejection sampling as a structured supervision construction process. Specifically, TrajFusion forms fused trajectories that explicitly model trial-and-error reasoning by interleaving selected incorrect trajectories with reflection prompts and correct trajectories. The length of each fused sample is adaptively controlled based on the frequency and diversity of teacher errors, providing richer supervision for challenging problems while safely reducing to vanilla rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT) when error signals are uninformative. TrajFusion requires no changes to the architecture or training objective. Extensive experiments across multiple math benchmarks demonstrate that TrajFusion consistently outperforms RFT, particularly on challenging and long-form reasoning problems.

TL;DR: 研究发现当代大型语言模型在临床推理中存在稳定的、模型特定的性别偏见，不同模型在性别分配上表现出显著差异，医疗应用需要谨慎配置和持续监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地应用于医疗工作流程，但这些模型训练数据中编码了现有偏见，包括诊断和治疗中的性别差异，担心这些模式可能被复制或放大。

Method: 使用50个临床医生编写的病例（涵盖44个专科，其中性别对初始诊断路径无信息价值），测试了四种通用LLM（ChatGPT、Claude 3.7 Sonnet、Gemini 2.0 Flash和DeepSeekchat）的性别分配倾向。

Result: 所有模型都表现出显著的性别分配偏差：ChatGPT在70%病例中分配女性性别，DeepSeek为61%，Claude为59%，而Gemini则显示男性偏向（仅36%分配女性）。允许弃权减少了显式标签，但未消除下游诊断差异。

Conclusion: 当代LLM在临床推理中存在稳定的模型特定性别偏见。安全的临床整合需要保守且有记录的配置、专科级临床数据审计，以及在医疗环境中部署通用模型时持续的人工监督。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in healthcare workflows for documentation, education, and clinical decision support. However, these systems are trained on large text corpora that encode existing biases, including sex disparities in diagnosis and treatment, raising concerns that such patterns may be reproduced or amplified. We systematically examined whether contemporary LLMs exhibit sex-specific biases in clinical reasoning and how model configuration influences these behaviours. We conducted three experiments using 50 clinician-authored vignettes spanning 44 specialties in which sex was non-informative to the initial diagnostic pathway. Four general-purpose LLMs (ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini), Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash and DeepSeekchat). All models demonstrated significant sex-assignment skew, with predicted sex differing by model. At temperature 0.5, ChatGPT assigned female sex in 70% of cases (95% CI 0.66-0.75), DeepSeek in 61% (0.57-0.65) and Claude in 59% (0.55-0.63), whereas Gemini showed a male skew, assigning a female sex in 36% of cases (0.32-0.41). Contemporary LLMs exhibit stable, model-specific sex biases in clinical reasoning. Permitting abstention reduces explicit labelling but does not eliminate downstream diagnostic differences. Safe clinical integration requires conservative and documented configuration, specialty-level clinical data auditing, and continued human oversight when deploying general-purpose models in healthcare settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their outputs often exhibit social biases, raising fairness concerns. Existing debiasing methods, such as fine-tuning on additional datasets or prompt engineering, face scalability issues or compromise user experience in multi-turn interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for detecting stereotype-inducing words and attributing neuron-level bias in LLMs, without the need for fine-tuning or prompt modification. Our framework first identifies stereotype-inducing adjectives and nouns via comparative analysis across demographic groups. We then attribute biased behavior to specific neurons using two attribution strategies based on integrated gradients. Finally, we mitigate bias by directly intervening on their activations at the projection layer. Experiments on three widely used LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces bias while preserving overall model performance.

TL;DR: Swordsman是一个基于熵驱动的自适应分块解码框架，通过识别相邻token间的熵变化来动态划分语义/句法成分边界，并实时调整解掩码阈值，显著提升扩散语言模型的推理速度和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分块解码方法通常采用固定分块方式，这会破坏完整的语义或句法成分结构，导致性能下降。受熵减少假说启发，作者认识到成分边界处存在更大的不确定性减少机会，因此需要更智能的分块策略。

Method: 提出Swordsman框架：1）通过分析相邻token间的熵变化来识别成分边界，实现自适应分块；2）根据块内实时解掩码状态动态调整解掩码阈值；3）基于KV Cache实现无需训练的高效推理。

Result: Swordsman在广泛评估中展现了最先进的性能，显著提升了扩散语言模型的推理效率和质量，同时保持了稳定性。

Conclusion: 基于熵驱动的自适应分块解码框架能够更好地对齐语义/句法成分边界，有效解决了固定分块方法导致的成分碎片化问题，为扩散语言模型的推理优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Block-wise decoding effectively improves the inference speed and quality in diffusion language models (DLMs) by combining inter-block sequential denoising and intra-block parallel unmasking. However, existing block-wise decoding methods typically partition blocks in a rigid and fixed manner, which inevitably fragments complete semantic or syntactic constituents, leading to suboptimal performance. Inspired by the entropy reduction hypothesis (ERH), we recognize that constituent boundaries offer greater opportunities for uncertainty reduction, which motivates us to employ entropy analysis for identifying constituent boundaries. Therefore, we propose Swordsman, an entropy-driven adaptive block-wise decoding framework for DLMs. Swordsman adaptively partitions blocks by identifying entropy shifts between adjacent tokens to better align with semantic or syntactic constituent boundaries. In addition, Swordsman dynamically adjusts unmasking thresholds conditioned on the real-time unmasking status within a block, further improving both efficiency and stability. As a training-free framework, supported by KV Cache, Swordsman demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across extensive evaluations.

TL;DR: H-GIVR框架通过多次观察图像并利用历史推理信息进行动态错误修正，显著提升多模态大语言模型的跨模态推理准确性，同时保持较低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自一致性方法局限于固定的"重复采样和投票"范式，无法重用历史推理信息，导致模型难以主动纠正视觉理解错误并在迭代中动态调整推理过程。

Method: 提出H-GIVR框架，在迭代推理过程中让MLLM多次观察图像，并将先前生成的答案作为后续步骤的参考，实现动态错误修正。

Result: 在五个数据集和三个模型上的实验表明，H-GIVR能显著提高跨模态推理准确性。例如在ScienceQA数据集上，使用Llama3.2-vision:11b模型平均每个问题只需2.57次响应即可达到78.90%的准确率，比基线提升107%。

Conclusion: H-GIVR框架通过模拟人类反复验证和动态纠错的推理行为，有效解决了现有自一致性方法的局限性，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了多模态推理性能。

Abstract: Self-consistency methods are the core technique for improving the reasoning reliability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By generating multiple reasoning results through repeated sampling and selecting the best answer via voting, they play an important role in cross-modal tasks. However, most existing self-consistency methods are limited to a fixed ``repeated sampling and voting'' paradigm and do not reuse historical reasoning information. As a result, models struggle to actively correct visual understanding errors and dynamically adjust their reasoning during iteration. Inspired by the human reasoning behavior of repeated verification and dynamic error correction, we propose the H-GIVR framework. During iterative reasoning, the MLLM observes the image multiple times and uses previously generated answers as references for subsequent steps, enabling dynamic correction of errors and improving answer accuracy. We conduct comprehensive experiments on five datasets and three models. The results show that the H-GIVR framework can significantly improve cross-modal reasoning accuracy while maintaining low computational cost. For instance, using \texttt{Llama3.2-vision:11b} on the ScienceQA dataset, the model requires an average of 2.57 responses per question to achieve an accuracy of 78.90\%, representing a 107\% improvement over the baseline.

TL;DR: 本文提出AUSteer方法，在原子单元(AU)级别进行激活导向，相比块级方法更精确高效，通过识别有益AU并自适应调整导向强度，实现更少激活导向获得更好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活导向方法通常在块级别（注意力头、前馈网络或残差流）进行干预，但块级激活本质上是异质的，混合了有益、无关和有害特征，导致导向粗糙、低效且具有侵入性。

Method: 提出AUSteer方法：1) 将块激活分解为原子单元(AU)级激活，每个AU对应块激活的单个维度；2) 通过对比样本计算激活动量全局识别判别性AU；3) 为不同输入和选定AU激活分配自适应导向强度。

Result: 在多个LLM和任务上的综合实验表明，AUSteer始终优于先进基线方法，同时导向的激活数量显著减少，证明了"导向更少，效果更好"。

Conclusion: 块级激活的异质性导致现有导向方法效率低下，在AU级别进行精细导向能更精确地修改LLM行为，AUSteer方法通过识别有益AU并自适应调整强度，实现了更高效的行为修改。

Abstract: Activation steering has emerged as a cost-effective paradigm for modifying large language model (LLM) behaviors. Existing methods typically intervene at the block level, steering the bundled activations of selected attention heads, feedforward networks, or residual streams. However, we reveal that block-level activations are inherently heterogeneous, entangling beneficial, irrelevant, and harmful features, thereby rendering block-level steering coarse, inefficient, and intrusive. To investigate the root cause, we decompose block activations into fine-grained atomic unit (AU)-level activations, where each AU-level activation corresponds to a single dimension of the block activation, and each AU denotes a slice of the block weight matrix. Steering an AU-level activation is thus equivalent to steering its associated AU. Our theoretical and empirical analysis show that heterogeneity arises because different AUs or dimensions control distinct token distributions in LLM outputs. Hence, block-level steering inevitably moves helpful and harmful token directions together, which reduces efficiency. Restricting intervention to beneficial AUs yields more precise and effective steering. Building on this insight, we propose AUSteer, a simple and efficient method that operates at a finer granularity of the AU level. AUSteer first identifies discriminative AUs globally by computing activation momenta on contrastive samples. It then assigns adaptive steering strengths tailored to diverse inputs and selected AU activations. Comprehensive experiments on multiple LLMs and tasks show that AUSteer consistently surpasses advanced baselines while steering considerably fewer activations, demonstrating that steering less achieves more.

Motivation: 现有研究仅评估了mDAPT在选择题上的效果，但其在真实企业运营生成任务中的潜力和瓶颈尚不明确，需要系统评估。

Method: 将回答过程分解为三个子任务进行评估：(1) 从LLM自身知识中提取相关事实；(2) 基于事实进行推理得出结论；(3) 根据结论撰写长文本回答。在IT技术支持运营的真实问题上验证mDAPT。

Result: mDAPT解决了基础模型在知识提取任务上的困难，但未能解决推理和长文本生成任务。进一步分析表明，解决提取和推理任务可确保90%以上的性能，突显了增强推理能力的必要性。

Conclusion: mDAPT在知识层面有效，但在推理和生成方面存在瓶颈。未来工作需要重点提升LLM在微领域中的推理能力。

Abstract: When applying LLMs to real-world enterprise operations, LLMs need to handle proprietary knowledge in small domains of specific operations ($\textbf{micro domains}$). A previous study shows micro domain-adaptive pre-training ($\textbf{mDAPT}$) with fewer documents is effective, similarly to DAPT in larger domains. However, it evaluates mDAPT only on multiple-choice questions; thus, its effectiveness for generative tasks in real-world operations remains unknown. We aim to reveal the potential and bottlenecks of mDAPT for generative tasks. To this end, we disentangle the answering process into three subtasks and evaluate the performance of each subtask: (1) $\textbf{eliciting}$ facts relevant to questions from an LLM's own knowledge, (2) $\textbf{reasoning}$ over the facts to obtain conclusions, and (3) $\textbf{composing}$ long-form answers based on the conclusions. We verified mDAPT on proprietary IT product knowledge for real-world questions in IT technical support operations. As a result, mDAPT resolved the elicitation task that the base model struggled with but did not resolve other subtasks. This clarifies mDAPT's effectiveness in the knowledge aspect and its bottlenecks in other aspects. Further analysis empirically shows that resolving the elicitation and reasoning tasks ensures sufficient performance (over 90%), emphasizing the need to enhance reasoning capability.

Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型在端到端GMNER任务中的应用潜力，发现MLLMs存在模态偏差问题（视觉偏差和文本偏差），倾向于采用单模态捷径而非跨模态验证。

Method: 提出Modality-aware Consistency Reasoning (MCR)方法，包含两个核心组件：Multi-style Reasoning Schema Injection (MRSI)将抽象约束转化为可执行推理链；Constraint-guided Verifiable Optimization (CVO)通过Group Relative Policy Optimization实现动态对齐推理轨迹。

Result: 在GMNER和视觉定位任务上的实验表明，MCR能有效缓解模态偏差，相比现有基线方法取得更优性能。

Conclusion: MCR方法通过结构化跨模态推理机制，成功解决了MLLMs在GMNER任务中的模态偏差问题，为端到端多模态实体识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) aims to extract text-based entities, assign them semantic categories, and ground them to corresponding visual regions. In this work, we explore the potential of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform GMNER in an end-to-end manner, moving beyond their typical role as auxiliary tools within cascaded pipelines. Crucially, our investigation reveals a fundamental challenge: MLLMs exhibit $\textbf{modality bias}$, including visual bias and textual bias, which stems from their tendency to take unimodal shortcuts rather than rigorous cross-modal verification. To address this, we propose Modality-aware Consistency Reasoning ($\textbf{MCR}$), which enforces structured cross-modal reasoning through Multi-style Reasoning Schema Injection (MRSI) and Constraint-guided Verifiable Optimization (CVO). MRSI transforms abstract constraints into executable reasoning chains, while CVO empowers the model to dynamically align its reasoning trajectories with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on GMNER and visual grounding tasks demonstrate that MCR effectively mitigates modality bias and achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: 潜在过程混合模型为分析花园路径句处理提供了更精细的框架，能够区分不同处理成本并考虑注意力因素，对未来研究具有重要启示。

Abstract: Using temporarily ambiguous garden-path sentences ("While the team trained the striker wondered ...") as a test case, we present a latent-process mixture model of human reading behavior across four different reading paradigms (eye tracking, uni- and bidirectional self-paced reading, Maze). The model distinguishes between garden-path probability, garden-path cost, and reanalysis cost, and yields more realistic processing cost estimates by taking into account trials with inattentive reading. We show that the model is able to reproduce empirical patterns with regard to rereading behavior, comprehension question responses, and grammaticality judgments. Cross-validation reveals that the mixture model also has better predictive fit to human reading patterns and end-of-trial task data than a mixture-free model based on GPT-2-derived surprisal values. We discuss implications for future work.

Conclusion: PersoDPO提供了一个可扩展且可复现的训练流程，能够有效提升对话模型在个性化和上下文连贯性方面的表现，为构建更有效的人物基础对话系统提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Personalization and contextual coherence are two essential components in building effective persona-grounded dialogue systems. These aspects play a crucial role in enhancing user engagement and ensuring responses are more relevant and consistent with user identity. However, recent studies indicate that open-source large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle to generate responses that are both contextually grounded and aligned with persona cues, despite exhibiting strong general conversational abilities like fluency and naturalness. We present PersoDPO, a scalable preference optimisation framework that uses supervision signals from automatic evaluations of responses generated by both closed-source and open-source LLMs to fine-tune dialogue models. The framework integrates evaluation metrics targeting coherence and personalization, along with a length-format compliance feature to promote instruction adherence. These signals are combined to automatically construct high-quality preference pairs without manual annotation, enabling a scalable and reproducible training pipeline. Experiments on the FoCus dataset show that an open-source language model fine-tuned with the PersoDPO framework consistently outperforms strong open-source baselines and a standard Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) variant across multiple evaluation dimensions.

Conclusion: Model-Dowser是一种有效的稀疏微调方法，能在保持预训练任务泛化能力的同时提升下游任务性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on task-specific data is an effective way to improve performance on downstream applications. However, such adaptation often leads to a degradation in generalization on pretrained tasks, a phenomenon known as Catastrophic Forgetting. Existing methods that aim to mitigate this issue either become ineffective when fine-tuning deeper layers of the language decoder or scale poorly with increasing model size. To address these limitations, we propose Model-Dowser, a novel sparse fine-tuning approach for MLLMs. Model-Dowser measures a principled importance score for each model parameter with respect to pretrained generalization (prior to downstream adaptation) by jointly considering weight magnitudes, input activations, and output sensitivities. During fine-tuning, Model-Dowser selectively preserves high-importance parameters and updates the remaining. Comprehensive experiments on two representative MLLMs, LLaVA and NVILA, demonstrate that Model-Dowser effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and consistently outperforms prior methods, while remaining resource-efficient and scalable to multi-billion-parameter models.

Motivation: 现有LLM安全策略依赖推理时干预，增加计算成本和部署复杂度。激活引导等方法需要运行时钩子，成本随生成次数增加。需要将选择性拒绝功能完全离线化，避免推理时控制路径。

Method: C-Δθ（电路限制权重算术）：1）使用EAP-IG定位拒绝因果计算的稀疏电路；2）计算仅在该电路上支持的约束权重更新ΔθC（通常<5%参数）。应用ΔθC生成可直接部署的编辑检查点，无需推理时钩子。

Conclusion: C-Δθ方法能够将选择性拒绝功能完全离线化，通过电路限制权重更新实现高效的安全策略部署，无需推理时干预，显著降低部署复杂度和计算成本。

Abstract: Modern deployments require LLMs to enforce safety policies at scale, yet many controls rely on inference-time interventions that add recurring compute cost and serving complexity. Activation steering is widely used, but it requires runtime hooks and scales cost with the number of generations; conditional variants improve selectivity by gating when steering is applied but still retain an inference-time control path. We ask whether selective refusal can be moved entirely offline: can a mechanistic understanding of category-specific refusal be distilled into a circuit-restricted weight update that deploys as a standard checkpoint? We propose C-Δθ: Circuit Restricted Weight Arithmetic, which (i) localizes refusal-causal computation as a sparse circuit using EAP-IG and (ii) computes a constrained weight update ΔθC supported only on that circuit (typically <5% of parameters). Applying ΔθC yields a drop-in edited checkpoint with no inference-time hooks, shifting cost from per-request intervention to a one-time offline update. We evaluate category-targeted selectivity and capability retention on refusal and utility benchmarks.

Motivation: 长上下文大语言模型在解码时面临KV缓存快速膨胀的问题，导致内存和延迟成本高昂。现有方法通过跨层共享关键令牌来缓解，但这种粗粒度共享忽略了注意力头的功能多样性，损害了模型性能。

Method: 提出LycheeDecode方法，采用细粒度混合头注意力机制和硬件高效的top-k选择策略。通过基于HardKuma的机制将注意力头分为：1）少量检索头动态识别关键令牌；2）多数稀疏头重用这些令牌进行高效计算。

Result: 在Llama3、Qwen3等主流模型上，通过LongBench、RULER等长上下文理解基准和AIME24、OlympiadBench等复杂推理基准测试，LycheeDecode在生成质量上达到甚至超过完整注意力基线，同时在128K上下文长度下实现高达2.7倍加速。

Conclusion: LycheeDecode通过保留注意力头的功能多样性，克服了现有方法的性能瓶颈，为高效且高质量的长上下文LLM推理提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The proliferation of long-context large language models (LLMs) exposes a key bottleneck: the rapidly expanding key-value cache during decoding, which imposes heavy memory and latency costs. While recent approaches attempt to alleviate this by sharing a single set of crucial tokens across layers, such coarse-grained sharing undermines model performance by neglecting the functional diversity of attention heads. To address this, we propose LycheeDecode, an efficient decoding method centered on a fine-grained hybrid-head attention mechanism that employs a hardware-efficient top-k selection strategy. Specifically, the novel HardKuma-based mechanism partitions attention heads into a small subset of retrieval heads that dynamically identify crucial tokens and a majority of sparse heads that reuse them for efficient computation. Through extensive experiments on leading models like Llama3 and Qwen3 across diverse benchmarks for long-context understanding (e.g., LongBench, RULER) and complex reasoning (e.g., AIME24, OlympiadBench), we demonstrate that LycheeDecode achieves generative quality comparable to, and at times surpassing even the full-attention baseline. Crucially, this is accomplished with up to a 2.7x speedup at a 128K context length. By preserving the functional diversity of attention heads, our fine-grained strategy overcomes the performance bottlenecks of existing methods, providing a powerful and validated pathway to both efficient and high-quality long-context LLM inference.

*Jian Gu,Aldeida Aleti,Chunyang Chen,Hongyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pseudo-Inverse Tying (PIT) 通过共享潜在令牌内存的耦合投影同步嵌入和解嵌入，保证伪逆一致性接口，改善训练稳定性并减少副作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统权重绑定虽然减少参数，但无法保证稳定的令牌接口，训练中编码和解码对应关系会漂移，导致优化敏感性和后训练干预不可预测。

Method: PIT 将嵌入和解嵌入作为共享潜在令牌内存的耦合投影同步，维护正交共享内存（通过薄极分解或随机正交初始化），引入完全学习的对称正定隐藏空间变换（通过Cholesky因子参数化），输出头应用变换到隐藏状态，嵌入使用稳定三角求解应用逆变换。

Result: 在256M-1.3B参数的设备端模型上评估，PIT 在预训练和适应中都表现出改进的训练稳定性、更强的层间语义一致性，并显著减少副作用。

Conclusion: PIT 通过保证伪逆一致性接口，解决了传统权重绑定的稳定性问题，为紧凑语言模型提供了更可靠和可预测的训练框架。

Abstract: Weight tying is widely used in compact language models to reduce parameters by sharing the token table between the input embedding and the output projection. However, weight sharing does not guarantee a stable token interface: during training, the correspondence between encoding tokens into hidden states and decoding hidden states into logits can drift, worsening optimization sensitivity and making post-training interventions such as editing, patching, and lightweight adaptation less predictable. We propose Pseudo-Inverse Tying (PIT), which synchronizes embedding and unembedding as coupled projections of a shared latent token memory, guaranteeing a pseudo-inverse-consistent interface throughout training. PIT maintains an orthonormal shared memory, obtained by thin polar decomposition for teacher initialization or random orthonormal initialization from scratch, and introduces a fully learned symmetric positive definite hidden-space transform parameterized via a Cholesky factor. The output head applies this transform to hidden states before the vocabulary projection, while the embedding applies the inverse transform to token vectors using stable triangular solves, avoiding explicit pseudo-inverse recomputation and any vocabulary-sized auxiliary parameters. We evaluate PIT on on-device models spanning 256M-1.3B parameters across pretraining and adaptation, and consistently observe improved training stability, stronger layerwise semantic consistency, and substantially reduced side effects.

TL;DR: EmbedPlan使用冻结语言嵌入空间中的轻量级转换模型替代自回归生成，通过预测下一状态嵌入和最近邻检索实现快速规划，避免了LLM的逐token生成和完整前向传递的计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM规划存在逐token生成和重复完整前向传递的瓶颈，使得多步前瞻和基于rollout的搜索在延迟和计算上非常昂贵，需要更高效的规划方法。

Method: 将自然语言状态和动作描述编码为向量，在冻结的语言嵌入空间中预测下一状态嵌入，通过最近邻相似性检索下一状态，无需微调编码器即可实现快速规划计算。

Result: 在九个经典规划领域的六种难度递增的评估协议中：插值性能接近完美，但当泛化需要转移到未见问题或未见领域时性能急剧下降；计划变体评估表明模型能泛化到替代计划而非记忆轨迹。

Conclusion: 冻结嵌入支持在观察领域转换后学习领域内动态，但跨领域边界的转移仍然是瓶颈，需要在领域间泛化方面进一步改进。

Abstract: Planning with LLMs is bottlenecked by token-by-token generation and repeated full forward passes, making multi-step lookahead and rollout-based search expensive in latency and compute. We propose EmbedPlan, which replaces autoregressive next-state generation with a lightweight transition model operating in a frozen language embedding space. EmbedPlan encodes natural language state and action descriptions into vectors, predicts the next-state embedding, and retrieves the next state by nearest-neighbor similarity, enabling fast planning computation without fine-tuning the encoder. We evaluate next-state prediction across nine classical planning domains using six evaluation protocols of increasing difficulty: interpolation, plan-variant, extrapolation, multi-domain, cross-domain, and leave-one-out. Results show near-perfect interpolation performance but a sharp degradation when generalization requires transfer to unseen problems or unseen domains; plan-variant evaluation indicates generalization to alternative plans rather than memorizing seen trajectories. Overall, frozen embeddings support within-domain dynamics learning after observing a domain's transitions, while transfer across domain boundaries remains a bottleneck.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过自举收敛分析确定人类完形填空数据中熵估计的稳定样本量，并比较LLMs与人类熵估计的对应关系


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决两个问题：1) 确定获得稳定无偏词级熵估计所需的人类响应数量；2) 评估LLMs能否替代人类规范数据来重现稳定的人类熵估计

Method: 使用两个大型公开完形填空数据集（德语和英语），实施基于自举法的收敛分析，追踪熵估计随样本量变化的稳定性。比较多个LLMs（GPT-4o、GPT2-xl、RoBERTa、LLaMA 2等）的熵估计与人类数据

Result: 超过97%的句子在可用样本量内达到稳定熵估计。90%句子收敛于111个德语响应和81个英语响应。低熵句子(<1)仅需20个响应，高熵句子(>2.5)需要更多。GPT-4o与人类数据对应最高，但对齐程度取决于提取方法和提示设计

Conclusion: 为人类规范实践提供实证指南，表明LLMs可以近似人类熵估计，但不能替代稳定的人类分布。收敛性关键取决于句子可预测性，LLMs与人类数据的对齐受方法和提示设计影响

Abstract: Predicting upcoming words is a core mechanism of language comprehension and may be quantified using Shannon entropy. There is currently no empirical consensus on how many human responses are required to obtain stable and unbiased entropy estimates at the word level. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as substitutes for human norming data, yet their ability to reproduce stable human entropy remains unclear. Here, we address both issues using two large publicly available cloze datasets in German 1 and English 2. We implemented a bootstrap-based convergence analysis that tracks how entropy estimates stabilize as a function of sample size. Across both languages, more than 97% of sentences reached stable entropy estimates within the available sample sizes. 90% of sentences converged after 111 responses in German and 81 responses in English, while low-entropy sentences (<1) required as few as 20 responses and high-entropy sentences (>2.5) substantially more. These findings provide the first direct empirical validation for common norming practices and demonstrate that convergence critically depends on sentence predictability. We then compared stable human entropy values with entropy estimates derived from several LLMs, including GPT-4o, using both logit-based probability extraction and sampling-based frequency estimation, GPT2-xl/german-GPT-2, RoBERTa Base/GottBERT, and LLaMA 2 7B Chat. GPT-4o showed the highest correspondence with human data, although alignment depended strongly on the extraction method and prompt design. Logit-based estimates minimized absolute error, whereas sampling-based estimates were better in capturing the dispersion of human variability. Together, our results establish practical guidelines for human norming and show that while LLMs can approximate human entropy, they are not interchangeable with stable human-derived distributions.

TL;DR: SSD通过将大型语言模型的语义分布蒸馏到轻量级学生模型中，实现低延迟的不确定性估计，用于幻觉预测和答案可靠性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在不确定性量化方面面临挑战，语义分散作为代理指标计算成本高，不适合延迟敏感的应用场景。

Method: 提出语义自蒸馏（SSD），将采样的语义分布蒸馏到轻量级学生模型中，学生模型在语言模型生成答案前就能预测语义分布，其熵值提供不确定性信号。

Result: 在TriviaQA上，学生模型在幻觉预测方面匹配或优于有限样本语义分散，并为域外答案检测提供强信号。

Conclusion: SSD为复杂输出空间中的预测不确定性蒸馏提供了通用框架，可扩展到语言之外的其他领域。

Abstract: Large language models present challenges for principled uncertainty quantification, in part due to their complexity and the diversity of their outputs. Semantic dispersion, or the variance in the meaning of sampled answers, has been proposed as a useful proxy for model uncertainty, but the associated computational cost prohibits its use in latency-critical applications. We show that sampled semantic distributions can be distilled into lightweight student models which estimate a prompt-conditioned uncertainty before the language model generates an answer token. The student model predicts a semantic distribution over possible answers; the entropy of this distribution provides an effective uncertainty signal for hallucination prediction, and the probability density allows candidate answers to be evaluated for reliability. On TriviaQA, our student models match or outperform finite-sample semantic dispersion for hallucination prediction and provide a strong signal for out-of-domain answer detection. We term this technique Semantic Self-Distillation (SSD), which we suggest provides a general framework for distilling predictive uncertainty in complex output spaces beyond language.

TL;DR: T3框架将LLM安全视为OOD检测问题，仅学习安全提示分布，无需有害样本训练，在18个基准测试中实现SOTA性能，假阳性率降低40倍，单模型可跨领域和14种语言迁移，生产部署开销低于6%。


<details>

Motivation: 当前LLM安全方法依赖脆弱的猫鼠游戏，通过护栏识别和阻止已知威胁。作者认为稳健的安全不应来自枚举有害内容，而应深入理解什么是安全的，需要从根本上改变安全范式。

Method: 提出Trust The Typical (T3)框架，将安全视为分布外检测问题。在语义空间中学习可接受提示的分布，将显著偏离标记为潜在威胁。无需有害示例训练，仅使用安全文本。

Result: 在18个基准测试中（毒性、仇恨言论、越狱、多语言危害、过度拒绝）实现SOTA性能，假阳性率相对专业安全模型降低达40倍。仅用安全英语文本训练的单模型可有效迁移到不同领域和14种语言。生产部署版本在vLLM中集成，令牌生成期间连续护栏开销低于6%。

Conclusion: T3框架通过将安全视为OOD检测问题，提供了一种更稳健的LLM安全方法，无需有害示例训练即可实现卓越性能，具有强大的跨领域和跨语言迁移能力，且生产就绪。

Abstract: Current approaches to LLM safety fundamentally rely on a brittle cat-and-mouse game of identifying and blocking known threats via guardrails. We argue for a fresh approach: robust safety comes not from enumerating what is harmful, but from deeply understanding what is safe. We introduce Trust The Typical (T3), a framework that operationalizes this principle by treating safety as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. T3 learns the distribution of acceptable prompts in a semantic space and flags any significant deviation as a potential threat. Unlike prior methods, it requires no training on harmful examples, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance across 18 benchmarks spanning toxicity, hate speech, jailbreaking, multilingual harms, and over-refusal, reducing false positive rates by up to 40x relative to specialized safety models. A single model trained only on safe English text transfers effectively to diverse domains and over 14 languages without retraining. Finally, we demonstrate production readiness by integrating a GPU-optimized version into vLLM, enabling continuous guardrailing during token generation with less than 6% overhead even under dense evaluation intervals on large-scale workloads.

Abstract: This paper describes VILLAIN, a multimodal fact-checking system that verifies image-text claims through prompt-based multi-agent collaboration. For the AVerImaTeC shared task, VILLAIN employs vision-language model agents across multiple stages of fact-checking. Textual and visual evidence is retrieved from the knowledge store enriched through additional web collection. To identify key information and address inconsistencies among evidence items, modality-specific and cross-modal agents generate analysis reports. In the subsequent stage, question-answer pairs are produced based on these reports. Finally, the Verdict Prediction agent produces the verification outcome based on the image-text claim and the generated question-answer pairs. Our system ranked first on the leaderboard across all evaluation metrics. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/ssu-humane/VILLAIN.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究基于特质的自动议论文评分，比较了两种建模范式：基于小规模开源LLM的结构化上下文学习，以及使用CORAL序数回归的BigBird监督模型。结果显示，显式建模分数序数性显著提高了与人类评分者的一致性，而小型LLM在无需微调的情况下也能取得竞争性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的自动作文评分系统主要关注整体分数，限制了其在教学中的实用性，特别是在议论文等复杂文体中。教育环境中，教师和学习者需要可解释的、特质层面的反馈，这些反馈应与教学目标和完善的评分标准对齐。

Method: 采用两种互补的建模范式：1）使用小型开源LLM进行结构化上下文学习，通过精心设计的、与评分标准对齐的上下文示例进行提示；2）使用基于BigBird编码器的监督模型，采用CORAL序数回归公式，专门针对长序列理解进行优化。

Result: 在ASAP++数据集上的系统评估显示，显式建模分数序数性显著提高了与人类评分者的一致性，在所有特质上都优于LLM以及基于名义分类和回归的基线方法。同时，小型开源LLM在无需任务特定微调的情况下也能取得竞争性表现，特别是在推理导向的特质上。

Conclusion: 研究强调了将模型目标与评分标准语义对齐对于教育评估的重要性。小型开源LLM为实现透明、隐私保护、可本地部署的评估场景提供了可能，为设计能够提供可解释、评分标准对齐反馈的AI教育系统提供了方法学、建模和实践方面的见解。

Abstract: Automated Essay Scoring systems have traditionally focused on holistic scores, limiting their pedagogical usefulness, especially in the case of complex essay genres such as argumentative writing. In educational contexts, teachers and learners require interpretable, trait-level feedback that aligns with instructional goals and established rubrics. In this paper, we study trait-based Automatic Argumentative Essay Scoring using two complementary modeling paradigms designed for realistic educational deployment: (1) structured in-context learning with small open-source LLMs, and (2) a supervised, encoder-based BigBird model with a CORAL-style ordinal regression formulation, optimized for long-sequence understanding. We conduct a systematic evaluation on the ASAP++ dataset, which includes essay scores across five quality traits, offering strong coverage of core argumentation dimensions. LLMs are prompted with designed, rubric-aligned in-context examples, along with feedback and confidence requests, while we explicitly model ordinality in scores with the BigBird model via the rank-consistent CORAL framework. Our results show that explicitly modeling score ordinality substantially improves agreement with human raters across all traits, outperforming LLMs and nominal classification and regression-based baselines. This finding reinforces the importance of aligning model objectives with rubric semantics for educational assessment. At the same time, small open-source LLMs achieve a competitive performance without task-specific fine-tuning, particularly for reasoning-oriented traits, while enabling transparent, privacy-preserving, and locally deployable assessment scenarios. Our findings provide methodological, modeling, and practical insights for the design of AI-based educational systems that aim to deliver interpretable, rubric-aligned feedback for argumentative writing.

TL;DR: RexBERT是一个专门针对电子商务语义的BERT风格编码器家族，使用3500亿token的电商语料库Ecom-niverse训练，在参数少2-3倍的情况下，在电商任务上超越通用编码器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用编码器通常在通用语料上训练，对电商等专业领域覆盖有限，而电商应用对延迟、稳定性和成本有严格要求，需要专门的领域编码器。

Method: 1) 构建Ecom-niverse电商语料库(3500亿token)；2) 基于ModernBERT架构的三阶段训练：通用预训练、上下文扩展、退火领域专业化；3) 训练17M到400M参数的RexBERT模型。

Result: RexBERT在参数少2-3倍的情况下，在电商数据集上的token分类、语义相似度和自然语言理解任务中，超越更大的通用编码器，匹配或超过现代长上下文模型。

Conclusion: 高质量领域数据与原则性训练方法的结合，为电商应用提供了比单纯扩大模型规模更强的基础，证明了领域专业化的重要性。

Abstract: Encoder-only transformers remain indispensable in retrieval, classification, and ranking systems where latency, stability, and cost are paramount. Most general purpose encoders, however, are trained on generic corpora with limited coverage of specialized domains. We introduce RexBERT, a family of BERT-style encoders designed specifically for e-commerce semantics. We make three contributions. First, we release Ecom-niverse, a 350 billion token corpus curated from diverse retail and shopping sources. We describe a modular pipeline that isolates and extracts e-commerce content from FineFineWeb and other open web resources, and characterize the resulting domain distribution. Second, we present a reproducible pretraining recipe building on ModernBERT's architectural advances. The recipe consists of three phases: general pre-training, context extension, and annealed domain specialization. Third, we train RexBERT models ranging from 17M to 400M parameters and evaluate them on token classification, semantic similarity, and general natural language understanding tasks using e-commerce datasets. Despite having 2-3x fewer parameters, RexBERT outperforms larger general-purpose encoders and matches or surpasses modern long-context models on domain-specific benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that high quality in-domain data combined with a principled training approach provides a stronger foundation for e-commerce applications than indiscriminate scaling alone.

Motivation: 随着LLM处理大规模上下文窗口，在审计、调试等高风险任务中需要精确的特征级解释。现有局部模型无关解释方法面临困境：基于特征的方法因高维特征导致归因稀释，无法提供忠实解释

Method: 提出Focus-LIME粗到细框架：1）使用代理模型筛选扰动邻域，2）让目标模型仅在优化后的上下文中进行细粒度归因，恢复可处理的外科手术式解释

Result: 在长上下文基准测试上的实证评估表明，该方法使外科手术式解释变得可行，并为用户提供忠实的解释

Conclusion: Focus-LIME框架成功解决了长上下文LLM中特征归因稀释问题，使精确的特征级解释在高风险任务中变得实用

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to handle massive context windows, achieving surgical feature-level interpretation is essential for high-stakes tasks like legal auditing and code debugging. However, existing local model-agnostic explanation methods face a critical dilemma in these scenarios: feature-based methods suffer from attribution dilution due to high feature dimensionality, thus failing to provide faithful explanations. In this paper, we propose Focus-LIME, a coarse-to-fine framework designed to restore the tractability of surgical interpretation. Focus-LIME utilizes a proxy model to curate the perturbation neighborhood, allowing the target model to perform fine-grained attribution exclusively within the optimized context. Empirical evaluations on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that our method makes surgical explanations practicable and provides faithful explanations to users.

Motivation: 现有机制可解释性研究在大语言模型的机器翻译任务中仅限于词级分析，缺乏对句子级翻译机制的深入理解。研究者希望从机制角度理解大语言模型内部如何编码和分配翻译功能。

Method: 将机器翻译分解为目标语言识别和句子等价性两个子任务，分析三个开源模型家族的20个翻译方向，识别专门化于每个子任务的稀疏注意力头集合，构建子任务特定的导向向量。

Result: 发现不同、稀疏的注意力头集合专门处理每个子任务。仅修改1%的相关头即可实现与基于指令提示相当的翻译性能，而选择性消融这些头会破坏对应的翻译功能。

Conclusion: 大语言模型通过专门的注意力头机制实现句子级机器翻译的不同子功能，这为机制可解释性提供了新见解，并展示了通过微调少量组件实现无指令翻译的潜力。

Abstract: Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) seeks to explain how neural networks implement their capabilities, but the scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has limited prior MI work in Machine Translation (MT) to word-level analyses. We study sentence-level MT from a mechanistic perspective by analyzing attention heads to understand how LLMs internally encode and distribute translation functions. We decompose MT into two subtasks: producing text in the target language (i.e. target language identification) and preserving the input sentence's meaning (i.e. sentence equivalence). Across three families of open-source models and 20 translation directions, we find that distinct, sparse sets of attention heads specialize in each subtask. Based on this insight, we construct subtask-specific steering vectors and show that modifying just 1% of the relevant heads enables instruction-free MT performance comparable to instruction-based prompting, while ablating these heads selectively disrupts their corresponding translation functions.

TL;DR: 提出LEAD方法，通过多层专家对齐解码来修正大型视觉语言模型在放射学报告生成中的幻觉问题，提高临床准确性


<details>

Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在放射学报告生成中存在幻觉问题，生成看似合理但缺乏图像依据的病理细节。现有方法主要依赖外部知识引导，但忽略了预训练模型固有的解码先验和视觉-语言对齐偏差，且因依赖构建的引导而缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 提出层间专家对齐解码（LEAD）方法：设计多专家模块提取不同病理特征，通过门控机制将这些特征整合到每个解码器层中。这种分层架构使LLM能在每个推理步骤中通过学习的门控函数咨询专家特征，动态修正解码偏差并引导生成朝向事实一致性。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，LEAD方法在临床准确性指标上取得了有效改进，减轻了幻觉问题，同时保持了高质量生成。

Conclusion: LEAD方法通过内在修改LVLM的解码轨迹，有效解决了放射学报告生成中的幻觉问题，提高了模型的临床准确性和事实一致性。

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to produce accurate and coherent diagnostics from medical images. Although large vision language models (LVLM) improve report fluency and accuracy, they exhibit hallucinations, generating plausible yet image-ungrounded pathological details. Existing methods primarily rely on external knowledge guidance to facilitate the alignment between generated text and visual information. However, these approaches often ignore the inherent decoding priors and vision-language alignment biases in pretrained models and lack robustness due to reliance on constructed guidance. In this paper, we propose Layer-wise Expert-aligned Decoding (LEAD), a novel method to inherently modify the LVLM decoding trajectory. A multiple experts module is designed for extracting distinct pathological features which are integrated into each decoder layer via a gating mechanism. This layer-wise architecture enables the LLM to consult expert features at every inference step via a learned gating function, thereby dynamically rectifying decoding biases and steering the generation toward factual consistency. Experiments conducted on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the LEAD method yields effective improvements in clinical accuracy metrics and mitigates hallucinations while preserving high generation quality.

Motivation: 大规模文本数据集（如出版物、网站等）包含两种特征：文本语义信息和文本间的关联关系（引用、链接等）。现有方法通常单独处理图结构或文本语义，缺乏将两者有效结合的方法。

Method: 提出一种嵌入方法，同时利用文本语义（通过LLM嵌入模型）和文本间的图结构关系（引用、链接等），在Web of Science数据集（约5600万篇科学出版物）上进行验证。

Abstract: Large text data sets, such as publications, websites, and other text-based media, inherit two distinct types of features: (1) the text itself, its information conveyed through semantics, and (2) its relationship to other texts through links, references, or shared attributes. While the latter can be described as a graph structure and can be handled by a range of established algorithms for classification and prediction, the former has recently gained new potential through the use of LLM embedding models. Demonstrating these possibilities and their practicability, we investigate the Web of Science dataset, containing ~56 million scientific publications through the lens of our proposed embedding method, revealing a self-structured landscape of texts.

Motivation: 现有生成式奖励模型和LLM评判存在欺骗性对齐问题——它们为了追求结果准确性而做出正确判断，但推理过程与人类不一致，这削弱了在RLHF中的泛化能力。

Method: 1. 提出Rationale Consistency（理由一致性）细粒度指标，量化模型推理过程与人类判断的对齐程度；2. 引入结合理由一致性和结果准确性的混合信号进行GenRM训练；3. 在RLHF中使用改进的奖励模型。

Result: 1. 理由一致性能有效区分SOTA模型并检测欺骗性对齐，而结果准确性则不能；2. 混合信号训练方法在RM-Bench达到87.1%，JudgeBench达到82%，比仅基于结果的基线平均提升5%；3. 在RLHF中，该方法在Arena Hard v2上显著提升性能，创意写作任务提升7%；4. 成功避免了欺骗性对齐陷阱，逆转了仅基于结果训练时理由一致性的下降趋势。

Conclusion: 理由一致性是评估和改进生成式奖励模型的关键指标，结合理由一致性与结果准确性的混合训练方法能有效解决欺骗性对齐问题，提升模型在RLHF中的泛化能力和整体性能。

Abstract: Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) and LLM-as-a-Judge exhibit deceptive alignment by producing correct judgments for incorrect reasons, as they are trained and evaluated to prioritize Outcome Accuracy, which undermines their ability to generalize during RLHF. We introduce Rationale Consistency, a fine-grained metric that quantifies the alignment between the model's reasoning process and human judgment. Our evaluation of frontier models reveals that rationale consistency effectively discriminates among state-of-the-art models and detects deceptive alignment, while outcome accuracy falls short in both respects. To mitigate this gap, we introduce a hybrid signal that combines rationale consistency with outcome accuracy for GenRM training. Our training method achieves state-of-the-art performance on RM-Bench (87.1%) and JudgeBench (82%), surpassing outcome-only baselines by an average of 5%. Using RM during RLHF, our method effectively improves performance as demonstrated on Arena Hard v2, notably yielding a 7% improvement in creative writing tasks. Further analysis confirms that our method escapes the deceptive alignment trap, effectively reversing the decline in rationale consistency observed in outcome-only training.

Result: 研究结果突出了不同方法之间的权衡关系，具体表现为传统算法、机器学习模型和深度学习工具各有优劣。

Conclusion: 针对斯洛伐克语STS任务，需要根据具体需求在不同方法之间进行选择，各种方法都有其适用场景和局限性。

Abstract: Semantic textual similarity (STS) plays a crucial role in many natural language processing tasks. While extensively studied in high-resource languages, STS remains challenging for under-resourced languages such as Slovak. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of sentence-level STS methods applied to Slovak, including traditional algorithms, supervised machine learning models, and third-party deep learning tools. We trained several machine learning models using outputs from traditional algorithms as features, with feature selection and hyperparameter tuning jointly guided by artificial bee colony optimization. Finally, we evaluated several third-party tools, including fine-tuned model by CloudNLP, OpenAI's embedding models, GPT-4 model, and pretrained SlovakBERT model. Our findings highlight the trade-offs between different approaches.

*Yang Yian,Yu Fan,Liudmila Zavolokina,Sarah Ebling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究分析了Stable Diffusion XL和DALL-E 3在生成残疾人图像时的表现，发现存在表征不平衡问题，需要持续评估和改进以促进更包容的残疾人描绘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然文本到图像生成模型在从文本描述生成高质量视觉内容方面取得了显著进展，但人们对其如何表征社会群体仍存担忧。虽然性别和种族等特征受到越来越多的关注，但残疾表征仍然未被充分探索。

Method: 通过结构化提示设计分析Stable Diffusion XL和DALL-E 3的输出，比较通用残疾提示和特定残疾类别提示之间的图像相似性，评估缓解策略如何影响残疾描绘，并通过自动和人工评估相结合的方式分析情感极性来评估情感框架。

Result: 研究发现存在持续的表征不平衡，突显了需要持续评估和改进生成模型，以促进更多样化和包容性的残疾描绘。

Conclusion: 需要持续评估和改进生成模型，以促进更多样化和包容性的残疾表征。

Abstract: Text-to-image generative models have made remarkable progress in producing high-quality visual content from textual descriptions, yet concerns remain about how they represent social groups. While characteristics like gender and race have received increasing attention, disability representations remain underexplored. This study investigates how people with disabilities are represented in AI-generated images by analyzing outputs from Stable Diffusion XL and DALL-E 3 using a structured prompt design. We analyze disability representations by comparing image similarities between generic disability prompts and prompts referring to specific disability categories. Moreover, we evaluate how mitigation strategies influence disability portrayals, with a focus on assessing affective framing through sentiment polarity analysis, combining both automatic and human evaluation. Our findings reveal persistent representational imbalances and highlight the need for continuous evaluation and refinement of generative models to foster more diverse and inclusive portrayals of disability.

### [57] [LinGO: A Linguistic Graph Optimization Framework with LLMs for Interpreting Intents of Online Uncivil Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04693)
*Yuan Zhang,Thales Bertaglia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LinGO框架通过语言图优化，利用多步语言组件和针对性优化，提高LLM对网络不文明语言意图的分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分类器常将含有不文明线索但表达文明意图的帖子误判，导致对网络有害不文明行为的高估。需要更准确区分不文明语言的多类意图。

Method: LinGO框架将语言分解为多步语言组件，识别导致最多错误的针对性步骤，迭代优化提示和/或示例组件。使用三种成本效益高的LLM和四种优化技术进行评估。

Result: 在所有模型中，LinGO相比零样本、思维链、直接优化和微调基线，持续提高准确率和加权F1。RAG是最强的优化技术，与Gemini模型配对时达到最佳整体性能。

Conclusion: 将多步语言组件纳入LLM指令并优化针对性组件，能帮助模型解释复杂语义含义，未来可扩展到其他复杂语义解释任务。

Abstract: Detecting uncivil language is crucial for maintaining safe, inclusive, and democratic online spaces. Yet existing classifiers often misinterpret posts containing uncivil cues but expressing civil intents, leading to inflated estimates of harmful incivility online. We introduce LinGO, a linguistic graph optimization framework for large language models (LLMs) that leverages linguistic structures and optimization techniques to classify multi-class intents of incivility that use various direct and indirect expressions. LinGO decomposes language into multi-step linguistic components, identifies targeted steps that cause the most errors, and iteratively optimizes prompt and/or example components for targeted steps. We evaluate it using a dataset collected during the 2022 Brazilian presidential election, encompassing four forms of political incivility: Impoliteness (IMP), Hate Speech and Stereotyping (HSST), Physical Harm and Violent Political Rhetoric (PHAVPR), and Threats to Democratic Institutions and Values (THREAT). Each instance is annotated with six types of civil/uncivil intent. We benchmark LinGO using three cost-efficient LLMs: GPT-5-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, and Claude 3 Haiku, and four optimization techniques: TextGrad, AdalFlow, DSPy, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The results show that, across all models, LinGO consistently improves accuracy and weighted F1 compared with zero-shot, chain-of-thought, direct optimization, and fine-tuning baselines. RAG is the strongest optimization technique and, when paired with Gemini model, achieves the best overall performance. These findings demonstrate that incorporating multi-step linguistic components into LLM instructions and optimize targeted components can help the models explain complex semantic meanings, which can be extended to other complex semantic explanation tasks in the future.

TL;DR: ERNIE 5.0是一个原生自回归基础模型，支持文本、图像、视频和音频的统一多模态理解与生成，采用超稀疏专家混合架构和弹性训练范式，实现万亿参数规模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大规模部署中不同资源约束下的实际挑战，并实现统一的多模态理解与生成能力，需要开发能够灵活权衡性能、模型大小和推理延迟的模型。

Method: 采用超稀疏专家混合架构，所有模态在统一的"下一组token预测"目标下从头训练，使用模态无关的专家路由。引入弹性训练范式，在单次预训练中学习具有不同深度、专家容量和路由稀疏度的子模型家族。

Result: ERNIE 5.0在多个模态上实现了强大且均衡的性能，是首个公开披露的万亿参数统一自回归模型，支持多模态理解与生成，并提供了模态无关专家路由的可视化分析。

Conclusion: ERNIE 5.0成功实现了生产级万亿参数统一多模态模型，通过弹性训练解决了大规模部署的挑战，为社区提供了关于模态无关专家路由和弹性训练的深刻见解。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce ERNIE 5.0, a natively autoregressive foundation model desinged for unified multimodal understanding and generation across text, image, video, and audio. All modalities are trained from scratch under a unified next-group-of-tokens prediction objective, based on an ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with modality-agnostic expert routing. To address practical challenges in large-scale deployment under diverse resource constraints, ERNIE 5.0 adopts a novel elastic training paradigm. Within a single pre-training run, the model learns a family of sub-models with varying depths, expert capacities, and routing sparsity, enabling flexible trade-offs among performance, model size, and inference latency in memory- or time-constrained scenarios. Moreover, we systematically address the challenges of scaling reinforcement learning to unified foundation models, thereby guaranteeing efficient and stable post-training under ultra-sparse MoE architectures and diverse multimodal settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERNIE 5.0 achieves strong and balanced performance across multiple modalities. To the best of our knowledge, among publicly disclosed models, ERNIE 5.0 represents the first production-scale realization of a trillion-parameter unified autoregressive model that supports both multimodal understanding and generation. To facilitate further research, we present detailed visualizations of modality-agnostic expert routing in the unified model, alongside comprehensive empirical analysis of elastic training, aiming to offer profound insights to the community.

### [59] [LiteToken: Removing Intermediate Merge Residues From BPE Tokenizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04706)
*Yike Sun,Haotong Yang,Zhouchen Lin,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了BPE分词器中存在的中间合并残留问题，并提出LiteToken方法来移除这些很少使用的残留标记，从而减少词汇表容量浪费并提高模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPE分词器在训练过程中会产生一些在最终词汇表中保留但实际使用频率极低的中间合并残留标记，这些标记不仅浪费词汇表容量，还增加了对对抗性或非典型输入的脆弱性。

Method: 提出LiteToken方法，通过识别并移除BPE词汇表中的中间合并残留标记。由于这些标记很少被使用，预训练模型通常可以直接适应修改后的分词器而无需额外微调。

Result: 实验表明，LiteToken能够减少标记碎片化、降低参数数量，并提高对噪声或拼写错误输入的鲁棒性，同时保持整体性能不变。

Conclusion: BPE分词器中存在中间合并残留问题，通过LiteToken方法移除这些残留标记可以有效优化词汇表效率，提高模型鲁棒性，且对预训练模型影响很小。

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental to how language models represent and process text, yet the behavior of widely used BPE tokenizers has received far less study than model architectures and training. In this paper, we investigate intermediate merge residues in BPE vocabularies: tokens that are frequent during merge learning so that retained in the final vocabulary, but are mostly further merged and rarely emitted when tokenizing the corpus during tokenizer usage. Such low-frequency tokens not only waste vocabulary capacity but also increase vulnerability to adversarial or atypical inputs. We present a systematic empirical characterization of this phenomenon across commonly used tokenizers and introduce LiteToken, a simple method for removing residue tokens. Because the affected tokens are rarely used, pretrained models can often accommodate the modified tokenizer without additional fine-tuning. Experiments show that LiteToken reduces token fragmentation, reduces parameters, and improves robustness to noisy or misspelled inputs, while preserving overall performance.

### [60] [Linguistically Informed Evaluation of Multilingual ASR for African Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04716)
*Fei-Yueh Chen,Lateef Adeleke,C. M. Downey*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文指出WER对非洲语言ASR性能评估存在局限，提出使用FER和TER等特征级错误率来揭示语言学上有意义的错误模式，尤其在音调特征方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统词错误率(WER)将语音识别模型在非洲语言上的各种语言学错误(音韵、音调等)合并为单一词汇错误，无法准确反映模型性能。需要更细粒度的评估指标来揭示语言学上有意义的错误模式。

Method: 评估三种语音编码器在两种非洲语言上的表现，补充使用字符错误率(CER)、特征错误率(FER)和音调感知扩展(TER)。通过计算音韵特征上的错误来揭示语言学显著性错误模式。

Result: FER和TER即使在词级准确率较低时也能揭示语言学显著性错误模式。模型在音段特征上表现较好，而音调特征(特别是中调和降调)最具挑战性。约鲁巴语结果显示WER=0.788，CER=0.305，FER=0.151；Uneme语(预训练数据中不存在的濒危语言)模型WER接近完全错误，CER=0.461，但FER相对较低为0.267。

Conclusion: 模型错误通常归因于个别语音特征错误，而WER等全有或全无的指标掩盖了这一事实。FER和TER提供了更细致、语言学上有意义的评估视角，特别适用于非洲语言等具有丰富音韵特征的语种。

Abstract: Word Error Rate (WER) mischaracterizes ASR models' performance for African languages by combining phonological, tone, and other linguistic errors into a single lexical error. By contrast, Feature Error Rate (FER) has recently attracted attention as a viable metric that reveals linguistically meaningful errors in models' performance. In this paper, we evaluate three speech encoders on two African languages by complementing WER with CER, and FER, and add a tone-aware extension (TER). We show that by computing errors on phonological features, FER and TER reveal linguistically-salient error patterns even when word-level accuracy remains low. Our results reveal that models perform better on segmental features, while tones (especially mid and downstep) remain the most challenging features. Results on Yoruba show a striking differential in metrics, with WER=0.788, CER=0.305, and FER=0.151. Similarly for Uneme (an endangered language absent from pretraining data) a model with near-total WER and 0.461 CER achieves the relatively low FER of 0.267. This indicates model error is often attributable to individual phonetic feature errors, which is obscured by all-or-nothing metrics like WER.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个大规模人工评估基准，专门评估多语言大语言模型在机器翻译中的文化本地化能力，发现当前模型在文化细微表达（如成语、双关语）方面表现较差，与语法准确性存在明显差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译基准主要关注词汇和语法准确性，但忽视了实际本地化所需的语用和文化基础能力。需要建立一个专门评估文化细微表达翻译质量的基准。

Method: 基于20种语言的87个翻译试点研究，评估了7个多语言大语言模型在15种目标语言上的表现。每个语言由5名母语评分者对全文翻译和特定文化语言片段（成语、双关语、节日、文化概念）进行0-3分质量评分。

Result: 全文翻译平均质量中等（1.68/3分），GPT-5（2.10/3）、Claude Sonnet 3.7（1.97/3）和Mistral Medium 3.1（1.84/3）表现最佳。片段级结果显示：节日（2.20/3）和文化概念（2.19/3）翻译明显优于成语（1.65/3）和双关语（1.45/3），成语最容易被省略不译。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语法充分性与文化共鸣之间的持续差距，强调了需要文化敏感的训练数据、改进的跨语言语用能力，以及更能反映实际交际能力的评估范式。这是首个专注于翻译本地化中文化细微表达的多语言人工标注基准。

Abstract: We present a large-scale human evaluation benchmark for assessing cultural localisation in machine translation produced by state-of-the-art multilingual large language models (LLMs). Existing MT benchmarks emphasise token-level and grammatical accuracy, but of ten overlook pragmatic and culturally grounded competencies required for real-world localisation. Building on a pilot study of 87 translations across 20 languages, we evaluate 7 multilingual LLMs across 15 target languages with 5 native-speaker raters per language. Raters scored both full-text translations and segment-level instances of culturally nuanced language (idioms, puns, holidays, and culturally embedded concepts) on an ordinal 0-3 quality scale; segment ratings additionally included an NA option for untranslated segments.
  Across full-text evaluations, mean overall quality is modest (1.68/3): GPT-5 (2.10/3), Claude Sonnet 3.7 (1.97/3), and Mistral Medium 3.1 (1.84/3) form the strongest tier with fewer catastrophic failures. Segment-level results show sharp category effects: holidays (2.20/3) and cultural concepts (2.19/3) translate substantially better than idioms (1.65/3) and puns (1.45/3), and idioms are most likely to be left untranslated. These findings demonstrate a persistent gap between grammatical adequacy and cultural resonance. To our knowledge, this is the first multilingual, human-annotated benchmark focused explicitly on cultural nuance in translation and localisation, highlighting the need for culturally informed training data, improved cross-lingual pragmatics, and evaluation paradigms that better reflect real-world communicative competence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于LLM的检索器在RAG应用中表现出色，但如何将通用LLM有效适配到特定领域（如生物医学）仍缺乏深入探索，需要解决领域专业化的问题。

Method: 提出Synthesize-Train-Merge (STM)模块化框架：1) 合成困难负样本增强训练；2) 优化检索提示；3) 通过模型合并整合专家模型，无需大量预训练。

Result: 在MTEB基准的12个医学和通用任务上，STM将任务特定专家提升最高23.5%（平均7.5%），合并模型优于单个专家和强基线，同时保持通用领域能力。

Conclusion: STM提供了一条可扩展、高效的路径，将通用LLM转化为高性能领域专用检索器，在保持通用能力的同时在专业任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the backbone of grounding Large Language Models (LLMs), improving knowledge updates and reducing hallucinations. Recently, LLM-based retriever models have shown state-of-the-art performance for RAG applications. However, several technical aspects remain underexplored on how to adapt general-purpose LLMs into effective domain-specific retrievers, especially in specialized domains such as biomedicine. We present Synthesize-Train-Merge (STM), a modular framework that enhances decoder-only LLMs with synthetic hard negatives, retrieval prompt optimization, and model merging. Experiments on a subset of 12 medical and general tasks from the MTEB benchmark show STM boosts task-specific experts by up to 23.5\% (average 7.5\%) and produces merged models that outperform both single experts and strong baselines without extensive pretraining. Our results demonstrate a scalable, efficient path for turning general LLMs into high-performing, domain-specialized retrievers, preserving general-domain capabilities while excelling on specialized tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）进行两阶段对抗提示安全评估，发现不同模型家族存在显著且持续的安全差异，模型更新导致对齐漂移，多模态漏洞模式随时间变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在实际系统中部署越来越多，但其在对抗提示下的安全性尚未得到充分探索。需要评估MLLMs在面对专业红队编写的对抗提示时的无害性表现。

Method: 采用两阶段评估方法：第一阶段测试GPT-4o、Claude Sonnet 3.5、Pixtral 12B和Qwen VL Plus；第二阶段测试它们的后续版本（GPT-5、Claude Sonnet 4.5、Pixtral Large和Qwen Omni）。使用26名专业红队编写的726个对抗提示作为固定基准，收集了82,256个人类危害评分。

Result: 发现模型家族间存在显著差异：Pixtral模型始终最脆弱，Claude模型因高拒绝率而最安全。攻击成功率显示对齐漂移：GPT和Claude模型在代际更新中攻击成功率增加，而Pixtral和Qwen略有下降。多模态效应随时间变化：第一阶段文本提示更有效，第二阶段出现模型特定模式，GPT-5和Claude 4.5在各模态上脆弱性接近。

Conclusion: MLLMs的无害性在不同模型间既不统一也不稳定，模型更新会导致安全行为变化。需要纵向、多模态基准测试来跟踪不断演变的安全行为，以确保模型部署的安全性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, yet their safety under adversarial prompting remains underexplored. We present a two-phase evaluation of MLLM harmlessness using a fixed benchmark of 726 adversarial prompts authored by 26 professional red teamers. Phase 1 assessed GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Pixtral 12B, and Qwen VL Plus; Phase 2 evaluated their successors (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Pixtral Large, and Qwen Omni) yielding 82,256 human harm ratings. Large, persistent differences emerged across model families: Pixtral models were consistently the most vulnerable, whereas Claude models appeared safest due to high refusal rates. Attack success rates (ASR) showed clear alignment drift: GPT and Claude models exhibited increased ASR across generations, while Pixtral and Qwen showed modest decreases. Modality effects also shifted over time: text-only prompts were more effective in Phase 1, whereas Phase 2 produced model-specific patterns, with GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 showing near-equivalent vulnerability across modalities. These findings demonstrate that MLLM harmlessness is neither uniform nor stable across updates, underscoring the need for longitudinal, multimodal benchmarks to track evolving safety behaviour.

TL;DR: LLMs在非正式在线政治立场检测中，通过用户历史帖子的上下文信息（用户画像摘要）可以显著提升分类准确率，最高可达74%，比基准方法提升17.5%-38.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线非正式政治讨论中语言通常具有讽刺性、模糊性和上下文依赖性，这使得政治立场检测变得困难。研究探索是否通过提供用户历史帖子的上下文信息（用户画像）能够提升LLMs的分类准确性。

Method: 使用真实世界政治论坛数据集，生成结构化用户画像（总结用户意识形态倾向、重复话题和语言模式）。评估7个最先进的LLMs在基准设置和上下文增强设置下的表现，进行全面的跨模型评估，并分析画像大小和帖子选择策略对性能的影响。

Result: 上下文提示显著提升准确率，改善范围从+17.5%到+38.5%，最高达到74%的准确率，超越了先前的方法。研究发现战略选择的政治内容比更大规模的随机选择上下文效果更好。

Conclusion: 在细微的政治分类任务中，整合用户层面的上下文信息对提升LLMs性能具有重要价值，特别是当上下文信息经过战略选择而非简单扩大规模时。

Abstract: This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for political stance detection in informal online discourse, where language is often sarcastic, ambiguous, and context-dependent. We explore whether providing contextual information, specifically user profile summaries derived from historical posts, can improve classification accuracy. Using a real-world political forum dataset, we generate structured profiles that summarize users' ideological leaning, recurring topics, and linguistic patterns. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs across baseline and context-enriched setups through a comprehensive cross-model evaluation. Our findings show that contextual prompts significantly boost accuracy, with improvements ranging from +17.5\% to +38.5\%, achieving up to 74\% accuracy that surpasses previous approaches. We also analyze how profile size and post selection strategies affect performance, showing that strategically chosen political content yields better results than larger, randomly selected contexts. These findings underscore the value of incorporating user-level context to enhance LLM performance in nuanced political classification tasks.

Motivation: 大型语言模型很少承认不确定性，经常产生流畅但误导性的答案，而不是选择弃权（拒绝回答）。在时序问答中，这个问题尤为明显，模型经常忽略时间敏感证据，混淆不同时间段的事实。现有方法（如校准）在捕捉复杂推理中的不确定性方面可能不可靠。

Method: 将弃权视为可教授的技能，引入一个结合思维链监督和强化学习的管道，使用弃权感知奖励进行指导。系统分析不同信息类型（原始上下文、时序子上下文、知识图谱）和训练技术对时序推理中弃权行为的影响。

Result: 强化学习在推理方面取得显著实证收益：基于Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct初始化的模型在TimeQA-Easy和Hard上的精确匹配分别超过GPT-4o 3.46%和5.80%。在不可回答问题上，真实阳性率比纯监督微调变体提高20%。分析显示SFT会导致过度自信并损害可靠性，而RL提高了预测准确性但也表现出类似风险。隐式推理线索对弃权推理的益处有限。

Conclusion: 该研究为如何联合优化弃权和推理提供了新见解，为构建更可靠的大型语言模型奠定了基础。强化学习在提升时序推理中的弃权能力方面表现出色，但需要进一步解决过度自信问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rarely admit uncertainty, often producing fluent but misleading answers, rather than abstaining (i.e., refusing to answer). This weakness is even evident in temporal question answering, where models frequently ignore time-sensitive evidence and conflate facts across different time-periods. In this paper, we present the first empirical study of training LLMs with an abstention ability while reasoning about temporal QA. Existing approaches such as calibration might be unreliable in capturing uncertainty in complex reasoning. We instead frame abstention as a teachable skill and introduce a pipeline that couples Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision with Reinforcement Learning (RL) guided by abstention-aware rewards. Our goal is to systematically analyze how different information types and training techniques affect temporal reasoning with abstention behavior in LLMs. Through extensive experiments studying various methods, we find that RL yields strong empirical gains on reasoning: a model initialized by Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct surpasses GPT-4o by $3.46\%$ and $5.80\%$ in Exact Match on TimeQA-Easy and Hard, respectively. Moreover, it improves the True Positive rate on unanswerable questions by $20\%$ over a pure supervised fine-tuned (SFT) variant. Beyond performance, our analysis shows that SFT induces overconfidence and harms reliability, while RL improves prediction accuracy but exhibits similar risks. Finally, by comparing implicit reasoning cues (e.g., original context, temporal sub-context, knowledge graphs) with explicit CoT supervision, we find that implicit information provides limited benefit for reasoning with abstention. Our study provides new insights into how abstention and reasoning can be jointly optimized, providing a foundation for building more reliable LLMs.

TL;DR: 大规模上下文学习在低资源机器翻译中效果有限：增加上下文长度带来的收益会快速饱和，甚至可能降低翻译质量，效果高度依赖语料库类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言的机器翻译面临高质量数据稀缺的挑战。虽然大语言模型提升了机器翻译性能，但如何将其适配到较少被代表的语言仍然困难。上下文学习可能为低资源机器翻译提供新的适配方法。

Method: 研究探索了将低资源机器翻译的上下文学习扩展到数千个示例的长上下文模型。将上下文token预算扩展到100万token，比较了三种训练语料库作为上下文监督：单语无监督数据、指令风格数据和并行数据（英语-目标语言和印尼语-目标语言）。在爪哇语和巽他语上进行实验。

Result: 实验显示：1）增加上下文带来的收益快速饱和，在接近最大上下文窗口时可能降低性能；2）缩放行为强烈依赖于语料库类型；3）某些形式的单语监督可以与并行数据竞争，尽管后者提供额外的监督信号。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了长上下文学习在低资源机器翻译中的有效限制和语料类型敏感性，表明更大的上下文窗口不一定带来成比例的质量提升。需要仔细选择语料库类型，单语数据在某些情况下可能足够有效。

Abstract: Building machine translation (MT) systems for low-resource languages is notably difficult due to the scarcity of high-quality data. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved MT system performance, adapting them to lesser-represented languages remains challenging. In-context learning (ICL) may offer novel ways to adapt LLMs for low-resource MT by conditioning models on demonstration at inference time. In this study, we explore scaling low-resource machine translation ICL beyond the few-shot setting to thousands of examples with long-context models. We scale in-context token budget to 1M tokens and compare three types of training corpora used as in-context supervision: monolingual unsupervised data, instruction-style data, and parallel data (English--target and Indonesian--target). Our experiments on Javanese and Sundanese show that gains from additional context saturate quickly and can degrade near the maximum context window, with scaling behavior strongly dependent on corpus type. Notably, some forms of monolingual supervision can be competitive with parallel data, despite the latter offering additional supervision. Overall, our results characterize the effective limits and corpus-type sensitivity of long-context ICL for low-resource MT, highlighting that larger context windows do not necessarily yield proportional quality gains.

TL;DR: OmniSIFT：面向Omni-LLM的模态非对称细粒度token压缩框架，通过时空视频剪枝和视觉引导音频选择两阶段策略，在仅使用25%原始token的情况下保持甚至超越全token模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Omni-LLM在音视频理解任务中表现出色，但依赖长多模态token序列导致巨大计算开销。目前针对Omni-LLM的token压缩方法有限，需要解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 提出OmniSIFT框架，采用两阶段压缩策略：1) 时空视频剪枝模块，消除帧内结构和帧间重叠带来的冗余；2) 视觉引导音频选择模块，过滤音频token。整个框架通过可微分直通估计器进行端到端优化。

Result: 在五个代表性基准测试中验证了OmniSIFT的有效性和鲁棒性。对于Qwen2.5-Omni-7B，仅引入4.85M参数，延迟低于OmniZip等无训练基线。仅使用25%原始token，在所有压缩基线中表现最优，甚至在某些任务上超越全token模型。

Conclusion: OmniSIFT为Omni-LLM提供了一种高效的多模态token压缩解决方案，在显著降低计算开销的同时保持或提升模型性能，解决了长多模态序列带来的计算挑战。

Abstract: Omni-modal Large Language Models (Omni-LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-video understanding tasks. However, their reliance on long multimodal token sequences leads to substantial computational overhead. Despite this challenge, token compression methods designed for Omni-LLMs remain limited. To bridge this gap, we propose OmniSIFT (Omni-modal Spatio-temporal Informed Fine-grained Token compression), a modality-asymmetric token compression framework tailored for Omni-LLMs. Specifically, OmniSIFT adopts a two-stage compression strategy: (i) a spatio-temporal video pruning module that removes video redundancy arising from both intra-frame structure and inter-frame overlap, and (ii) a vision-guided audio selection module that filters audio tokens. The entire framework is optimized end-to-end via a differentiable straight-through estimator. Extensive experiments on five representative benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of OmniSIFT. Notably, for Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, OmniSIFT introduces only 4.85M parameters while maintaining lower latency than training-free baselines such as OmniZip. With merely 25% of the original token context, OmniSIFT consistently outperforms all compression baselines and even surpasses the performance of the full-token model on several tasks.

TL;DR: SE-Bench是一个诊断环境，通过混淆NumPy库创建伪新包，评估智能体能否内化新知识并解决简单任务，揭示了闭卷训练的必要性、RL的局限性以及自博弈的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测量智能体作为终身学习者的自我进化能力面临两大障碍：先验知识的纠缠（新知识可能已存在于预训练数据中）和推理复杂性的纠缠（失败可能源于问题难度而非知识回忆能力）。需要创建一个干净的评估环境来分离这些因素。

Method: 将NumPy库及其API文档混淆成一个伪新包，使用随机标识符。智能体被训练内化这个包，然后在没有文档访问的情况下评估简单编码任务。任务设计为：使用新API文档时很简单，但基础模型没有该文档时无法完成。

Result: 揭示了三个关键发现：(1)开卷悖论：使用参考文档训练会抑制知识保留，需要"闭卷训练"强制知识压缩到权重中；(2)RL差距：标准RL因PPO裁剪和负梯度无法完全内化新知识；(3)自博弈可行性：结合SFT时，模型可以从自生成的噪声任务中学习，但RL不行。

Conclusion: SE-Bench为知识内化的自我进化能力建立了一个严格的诊断平台，揭示了当前训练方法的局限性，并为改进智能体的终身学习能力提供了方向。

Abstract: True self-evolution requires agents to act as lifelong learners that internalize novel experiences to solve future problems. However, rigorously measuring this foundational capability is hindered by two obstacles: the entanglement of prior knowledge, where ``new'' knowledge may appear in pre-training data, and the entanglement of reasoning complexity, where failures may stem from problem difficulty rather than an inability to recall learned knowledge. We introduce SE-Bench, a diagnostic environment that obfuscates the NumPy library and its API doc into a pseudo-novel package with randomized identifiers. Agents are trained to internalize this package and evaluated on simple coding tasks without access to documentation, yielding a clean setting where tasks are trivial with the new API doc but impossible for base models without it. Our investigation reveals three insights: (1) the Open-Book Paradox, where training with reference documentation inhibits retention, requiring "Closed-Book Training" to force knowledge compression into weights; (2) the RL Gap, where standard RL fails to internalize new knowledge completely due to PPO clipping and negative gradients; and (3) the viability of Self-Play for internalization, proving models can learn from self-generated, noisy tasks when coupled with SFT, but not RL. Overall, SE-Bench establishes a rigorous diagnostic platform for self-evolution with knowledge internalization. Our code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/thunlp/SE-Bench.

TL;DR: 分解式提示可作为闭卷问答中模型可靠性的实用诊断工具，通过不同提示方案间的分歧检测潜在错误


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在闭卷问答中难以识别知识边界，容易产生自信的幻觉。虽然分解式提示通常用于提高准确性，但本文研究其对可靠性的影响

Method: 评估三种任务等效提示方案（直接、辅助、增量），在不同模型规模和多跳QA基准上进行测试。利用跨方案一致性作为内部不确定性的精确信号，实现无需训练或检索的弃权策略

Result: 分解带来的准确性提升在先进模型中减弱，但提示方案间的分歧仍能高度指示潜在错误。基于分歧的弃权策略优于标准不确定性基线，在F1和AUROC指标上均有提升

Conclusion: 分解式提示可作为闭卷问答中模型可靠性的实用诊断探针，通过跨方案一致性有效检测模型不确定性

Abstract: Large language models often struggle to recognize their knowledge limits in closed-book question answering, leading to confident hallucinations. While decomposed prompting is typically used to improve accuracy, we investigate its impact on reliability. We evaluate three task-equivalent prompting regimes: Direct, Assistive, and Incremental, across different model scales and multi-hop QA benchmarks. We find that although accuracy gains from decomposition diminish in frontier models, disagreements between prompting regimes remain highly indicative of potential errors. Because factual knowledge is stable while hallucinations are stochastic, cross-regime agreement provides a precise signal of internal uncertainty. We leverage this signal to implement a training-free abstention policy that requires no retrieval or fine-tuning. Our results show that disagreement-based abstention outperforms standard uncertainty baselines as an error detector, improving both F1 and AUROC across settings. This demonstrates that decomposition-based prompting can serve as a practical diagnostic probe for model reliability in closed-book QA.

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型即使最终拒绝有害请求，其思维链推理过程中仍可能包含并传播不安全叙述，挑战了"拒绝即安全"的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前LLM安全评估的基本假设——即认为拒绝响应意味着整个推理过程都是安全的。研究发现即使模型最终拒绝生成假新闻，其思维链推理过程中仍可能包含有害内容。

Method: 提出统一的安全分析框架，系统解构思维链生成过程，跨模型层分析，使用基于雅可比矩阵的谱度量评估单个注意力头的作用。引入三个可解释度量：稳定性、几何性和能量，量化注意力头如何响应或嵌入欺骗性推理模式。

Result: 实验表明，当思维模式激活时，生成风险显著上升，关键路由决策集中在少数连续的中层深度。研究精确识别了导致这种分歧的注意力头。

Conclusion: 挑战了"拒绝即安全"的假设，为缓解潜在推理风险提供了新的理解视角，强调需要关注模型内部推理过程而不仅仅是最终输出。

Abstract: From generating headlines to fabricating news, the Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically assessed by their final outputs, under the safety assumption that a refusal response signifies safe reasoning throughout the entire process. Challenging this assumption, our study reveals that during fake news generation, even when a model rejects a harmful request, its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may still internally contain and propagate unsafe narratives. To analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a unified safety-analysis framework that systematically deconstructs CoT generation across model layers and evaluates the role of individual attention heads through Jacobian-based spectral metrics. Within this framework, we introduce three interpretable measures: stability, geometry, and energy to quantify how specific attention heads respond or embed deceptive reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning-oriented LLMs show that the generation risk rise significantly when the thinking mode is activated, where the critical routing decisions concentrated in only a few contiguous mid-depth layers. By precisely identifying the attention heads responsible for this divergence, our work challenges the assumption that refusal implies safety and provides a new understanding perspective for mitigating latent reasoning risks.

TL;DR: RAL通过强化学习直接优化多模态大语言模型的注意力分布而非输出序列，提升感知性能并改善跨模态对齐


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于强化学习的后训练方法通过生成冗长推理来提升LLMs的推理能力，但这种方法在多模态LLMs中效果有限，甚至可能降低感知性能。需要一种更直接优化多模态信息处理的方法。

Method: 提出强化注意力学习(RAL)框架，使用策略梯度方法直接优化内部注意力分布而非输出token序列。通过将优化重点从"生成什么"转向"关注哪里"，促进复杂多模态输入中的有效信息分配和更好的grounding。还引入On-Policy Attention Distillation方法，通过转移潜在注意力行为实现比标准知识蒸馏更强的跨模态对齐。

Result: 在多样化的图像和视频基准测试中，RAL相比GRPO和其他基线方法取得了一致的性能提升。注意力蒸馏方法在跨模态对齐方面表现优于标准知识蒸馏。

Conclusion: 注意力策略为多模态后训练提供了一个原则性和通用的替代方案，通过直接优化注意力分布而非输出序列，能够更有效地提升多模态LLMs的感知和grounding能力。

Abstract: Post-training with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has substantially improved reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) via test-time scaling. However, extending this paradigm to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) through verbose rationales yields limited gains for perception and can even degrade performance.
  We propose Reinforced Attention Learning (RAL), a policy-gradient framework that directly optimizes internal attention distributions rather than output token sequences. By shifting optimization from what to generate to where to attend, RAL promotes effective information allocation and improved grounding in complex multimodal inputs. Experiments across diverse image and video benchmarks show consistent gains over GRPO and other baselines. We further introduce On-Policy Attention Distillation, demonstrating that transferring latent attention behaviors yields stronger cross-modal alignment than standard knowledge distillation. Our results position attention policies as a principled and general alternative for multimodal post-training.

TL;DR: 非机器人专家能正确理解机器人基础模型评估中的任务成功率指标，并重视失败案例等额外信息，需要访问历史评估数据和机器人对新任务的性能预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人基础模型的发展，非专业用户会要求机器人执行未经训练的新任务。用户需要理解尝试这些任务的风险，并了解机器人的能力范围。然而，目前评估主要使用任务成功率作为指标，需要验证非专家是否能正确理解这些信息。

Method: 进行用户研究，向非机器人专家展示来自多个已发表RFM项目的真实评估数据，包括任务成功率、失败案例描述和视频。分析用户如何理解和利用这些信息。

Result: 非专家用户能够以符合专家预期的方式使用任务成功率信息，同时高度重视失败案例等通常不报告的信息类型。用户希望同时访问RFM的历史评估数据和机器人对新任务表现的预测。

Conclusion: 机器人基础模型评估应不仅报告任务成功率，还应包含失败案例等补充信息，并提供历史数据和性能预测，以帮助非专家用户做出明智决策。

Abstract: Robot Foundation Models (RFMs) represent a promising approach to developing general-purpose home robots. Given the broad capabilities of RFMs, users will inevitably ask an RFM-based robot to perform tasks that the RFM was not trained or evaluated on. In these cases, it is crucial that users understand the risks associated with attempting novel tasks due to the relatively high cost of failure. Furthermore, an informed user who understands an RFM's capabilities will know what situations and tasks the robot can handle. In this paper, we study how non-roboticists interpret performance information from RFM evaluations. These evaluations typically report task success rate (TSR) as the primary performance metric. While TSR is intuitive to experts, it is necessary to validate whether novices also use this information as intended. Toward this end, we conducted a study in which users saw real evaluation data, including TSR, failure case descriptions, and videos from multiple published RFM research projects. The results highlight that non-experts not only use TSR in a manner consistent with expert expectations but also highly value other information types, such as failure cases that are not often reported in RFM evaluations. Furthermore, we find that users want access to both real data from previous evaluations of the RFM and estimates from the robot about how well it will do on a novel task.

TL;DR: VLS是一个无需训练的推理时适应框架，通过视觉语言模型合成轨迹可微的奖励函数，引导预训练扩散/流匹配策略的采样过程，以应对测试时的空间和任务需求变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的扩散或流匹配策略在面对障碍物、支撑面偏移或轻度杂乱环境时经常失败，这些失败反映了模仿学习在训练-测试偏移下的局限性。重新训练或微调成本高且概念上不匹配，因为所需行为已存在但无法在测试时有选择地适应。

Method: VLS将适应视为推理时控制问题，利用视觉语言模型合成轨迹可微的奖励函数，在不修改策略参数的情况下，引导预训练扩散/流匹配策略的采样过程，使其满足测试时的空间和任务要求。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界评估中，VLS持续优于先前的引导方法，在CALVIN上实现31%的改进，在LIBERO-PRO上获得13%的提升。在Franka机器人上的真实世界部署进一步展示了在测试时空间和语义偏移下的鲁棒推理时适应能力。

Conclusion: VLS提供了一个无需训练、参数不变的推理时适应框架，能够有效应对机器人策略在测试时遇到的空间配置和任务规范变化，解决了模仿学习在训练-测试偏移下的局限性问题。

Abstract: Why do pretrained diffusion or flow-matching policies fail when the same task is performed near an obstacle, on a shifted support surface, or amid mild clutter? Such failures rarely reflect missing motor skills; instead, they expose a limitation of imitation learning under train-test shifts, where action generation is tightly coupled to training-specific spatial configurations and task specifications. Retraining or fine-tuning to address these failures is costly and conceptually misaligned, as the required behaviors already exist but cannot be selectively adapted at test time. We propose Vision-Language Steering (VLS), a training-free framework for inference-time adaptation of frozen generative robot policies. VLS treats adaptation as an inference-time control problem, steering the sampling process of a pretrained diffusion or flow-matching policy in response to out-of-distribution observation-language inputs without modifying policy parameters. By leveraging vision-language models to synthesize trajectory-differentiable reward functions, VLS guides denoising toward action trajectories that satisfy test-time spatial and task requirements. Across simulation and real-world evaluations, VLS consistently outperforms prior steering methods, achieving a 31% improvement on CALVIN and a 13% gain on LIBERO-PRO. Real-world deployment on a Franka robot further demonstrates robust inference-time adaptation under test-time spatial and semantic shifts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型面临长时程上下文限制和推理效率低下的问题，主要由于二次注意力复杂度和大量参数。观察到轨迹中大部分视觉信息（如背景）在时间步之间保持静态，可以利用这一特性优化模型

Method: 提出SD-VLA框架，将视觉输入分解为多级静态和动态token：1）跨帧保留静态token的单一副本以减少上下文长度；2）通过轻量级重缓存门仅在必要时更新静态token的KV缓存，实现高效多帧集成和推理

Result: 在新提出的长时程时序依赖建模基准上，SD-VLA比基线模型成功率提升39.8%；在SimplerEnv基准上提升3.9%；推理速度比基础VLA模型快2.26倍

Conclusion: SD-VLA通过视觉输入的静态-动态分解，有效解决了VLA模型的长时程上下文和推理效率问题，为实际部署提供了更快、更实用的解决方案

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for generalist robotic control. Built upon vision-language model (VLM) architectures, VLAs predict actions conditioned on visual observations and language instructions, achieving strong performance and generalization across tasks. However, VLAs face two major challenges: limited long-horizon context and inefficient inference due to the quadratic attention complexity and large parameter counts. Our work is motivated by the observation that much of the visual information in a trajectory remains static across timesteps (e.g., the background). Leveraging this property, we propose SD-VLA, a framework that disentangles visual inputs into multi-level static and dynamic tokens, which enables (1) retaining a single copy of static tokens across frames to significantly reduce context length, and (2) reusing the key-value (KV) cache of static tokens through a lightweight recache gate that updates only when necessary. This design enables efficient multi-frame integration and efficient inference. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark that more effectively evaluates the long-horizon temporal dependency modeling ability of VLAs. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms baselines on this benchmark by 39.8% absolute improvement in success rate, and achieves a 3.9% gain on the SimplerEnv benchmark. Moreover, SD-VLA delivers a 2.26x inference speedup over the base VLA model on the same benchmark, enabling faster and more practical real-world deployment.

Motivation: 现有群体模型多为反应式，忽略了鸟类姿态、翅膀拍动以及多旋翼无人机倾斜姿态等预示性信号，这些信号在方向改变前就提供了重要信息。为了提升群体协调性并应对传感延迟和噪声问题，需要引入预测机制。

Method: 提出FDA群体模型，将反应式对齐与基于邻居短期未来速度估计的预测项相结合。通过可调节的混合参数在反应式和预测式行为之间插值，增强速度共识和凝聚-分离平衡。

Conclusion: FDA模型通过生物启发的预测机制有效提升了群体协调性能，未来工作将研究自适应混合策略、加权预测方案以及在多旋翼无人机群上的实验验证。

Abstract: Understanding self-organization in natural collectives such as bird flocks inspires swarm robotics, yet most flocking models remain reactive, overlooking anticipatory cues that enhance coordination. Motivated by avian postural and wingbeat signals, as well as multirotor attitude tilts that precede directional changes, this work introduces a principled, bio-inspired anticipatory augmentation of reactive flocking termed Future Direction-Aware (FDA) flocking. In the proposed framework, agents blend reactive alignment with a predictive term based on short-term estimates of neighbors' future velocities, regulated by a tunable blending parameter that interpolates between reactive and anticipatory behaviors. This predictive structure enhances velocity consensus and cohesion-separation balance while mitigating the adverse effects of sensing and communication delays and measurement noise that destabilize reactive baselines. Simulation results demonstrate that FDA achieves faster and higher alignment, enhanced translational displacement of the flock, and improved robustness to delays and noise compared to a purely reactive model. Future work will investigate adaptive blending strategies, weighted prediction schemes, and experimental validation on multirotor drone swarms.

Abstract: Neuroendovascular access often relies on passive microwires that are hand-shaped at the back table and then used to track a microcatheter to the target. Neuroendovascular surgeons determine the shape of the wire by examining the patient pre-operative images and using their experience to identify anatomy specific shapes of the wire that would facilitate reaching the target. This procedure is particularly complex in convoluted anatomical structures and is heavily dependent on the level of expertise of the surgeon. Towards enabling standardized autonomous shaping, we present a bench-top guidewire shaping robot capable of producing navigation-specific desired wire configurations. We present a model that can map the desired wire shape into robot actions, calibrated using experimental data. We show that the robot can produce clinically common tip geometries (C, S, Angled, Hook) and validate them with respect to the model-predicted shapes in 2D. Our model predicts the shape with a Root Mean Square (RMS) error of 0.56mm across all shapes when compared to the experimental results. We also demonstrate 3D tip shaping capabilities and the ability to traverse complex endoluminal navigation from the petrous Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) to the Posterior Communicating Artery (PComm).

TL;DR: 提出一种针对GNSS拒止、非惯性环境下四旋翼的鲁棒控制与估计框架，无需依赖IMU和GNSS，仅使用外部位置测量结合EKF-UI估计器来处理平台运动


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GNSS拒止、非惯性环境中，传统IMU无法区分四旋翼自身加速度和平台运动导致的加速度，导致估计漂移和控制性能下降。现有方法过度依赖IMU和GNSS，限制了在移动平台（如卡车、电梯）上的应用

Method: 采用外部位置测量结合未知输入扩展卡尔曼滤波器(EKF-UI)来估计平台运动，配合级联PID控制器实现3D轨迹跟踪。使用高精度运动捕捉系统隔离定位误差影响

Result: 在移动推车测试平台上验证了方法在X轴和Y轴平移扰动下的有效性。相比标准EKF，显著提高了稳定性和轨迹跟踪性能，无需惯性反馈

Conclusion: 该方法能够在非惯性环境下实现鲁棒的四旋翼控制，为在移动平台上的实际部署提供了可行方案，突破了传统IMU依赖的限制

Abstract: We present a robust control and estimation framework for quadrotors operating in Global Navigation Satellite System(GNSS)-denied, non-inertial environments where inertial sensors such as Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) become unreliable due to platform-induced accelerations. In such settings, conventional estimators fail to distinguish whether the measured accelerations arise from the quadrotor itself or from the non-inertial platform, leading to drift and control degradation. Unlike conventional approaches that depend heavily on IMU and GNSS, our method relies exclusively on external position measurements combined with a Extended Kalman Filter with Unknown Inputs (EKF-UI) to account for platform motion. The estimator is paired with a cascaded PID controller for full 3D tracking. To isolate estimator performance from localization errors, all tests are conducted using high-precision motion capture systems. Experimental results in a moving-cart testbed validate our approach under both translational in X-axis and Y-axis dissonance. Compared to standard EKF, the proposed method significantly improves stability and trajectory tracking without requiring inertial feedback, enabling practical deployment on moving platforms such as trucks or elevators.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自主超声骶骨截骨机器人系统，通过光学跟踪系统引导，在Sawbones模型上验证了相比手动操作的显著精度提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动骶骨截骨存在轨迹精度不足和深度控制困难的问题，需要开发更安全、更精确的机器人辅助系统来克服这些临床限制

Method: 集成超声截骨刀与7自由度机械臂，通过光学跟踪系统引导，在相同截骨条件下对比手动超声截骨(MUSO)和机器人超声截骨(RUSO)在Sawbones模型上的表现

Result: RUSO系统实现了亚毫米级轨迹精度(0.11 mm RMSE)，比MUSO(1.10 mm RMSE)提高一个数量级；深度控制方面，MUSO过度穿透16.0 mm(目标8.0 mm)，而RUSO精确控制为8.1 mm

Conclusion: 机器人程序能有效克服手动截骨的关键限制，为更安全、更精确的骶骨切除手术奠定了基础

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an autonomous Ultrasonic Sacral Osteotomy (USO) robotic system that integrates an ultrasonic osteotome with a seven-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robotic manipulator guided by an optical tracking system. To assess multi-directional control along both the surface trajectory and cutting depth of this system, we conducted quantitative comparisons between manual USO (MUSO) and robotic USO (RUSO) in Sawbones phantoms under identical osteotomy conditions. The RUSO system achieved sub-millimeter trajectory accuracy (0.11 mm RMSE), an order of magnitude improvement over MUSO (1.10 mm RMSE). Moreover, MUSO trials showed substantial over-penetration (16.0 mm achieved vs. 8.0 mm target), whereas the RUSO system maintained precise depth control (8.1 mm). These results demonstrate that robotic procedures can effectively overcome the critical limitations of manual osteotomy, establishing a foundation for safer and more precise sacral resections.

TL;DR: KGLAMP是一个知识图谱引导的LLM规划框架，用于异构多机器人团队，通过结构化知识图谱指导LLM生成准确的PDDL问题规范，在动态环境中保持规划一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构多机器人系统在长期任务中需要协调，但现有规划方法难以构建准确的符号表示并在动态环境中保持规划一致性。传统PDDL规划器需要手动构建符号模型，而基于LLM的规划器往往忽略机器人异构性和环境不确定性。

Method: KGLAMP框架维护一个结构化知识图谱，编码对象关系、空间可达性和机器人能力，该知识图谱指导LLM生成准确的PDDL问题规范。知识图谱作为持久化、动态更新的记忆，整合新观察并在检测到不一致时触发重新规划。

Result: 在MAT-THOR基准测试中，KGLAMP相比纯LLM和基于PDDL的变体，性能提升至少25.5%。

Conclusion: KGLAMP通过结合知识图谱的结构化表示和LLM的推理能力，有效解决了异构多机器人系统在动态环境中的规划问题，显著提升了规划性能。

Abstract: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems are increasingly deployed in long-horizon missions that require coordination among robots with diverse capabilities. However, existing planning approaches struggle to construct accurate symbolic representations and maintain plan consistency in dynamic environments. Classical PDDL planners require manually crafted symbolic models, while LLM-based planners often ignore agent heterogeneity and environmental uncertainty. We introduce KGLAMP, a knowledge-graph-guided LLM planning framework for heterogeneous multi-robot teams. The framework maintains a structured knowledge graph encoding object relations, spatial reachability, and robot capabilities, which guides the LLM in generating accurate PDDL problem specifications. The knowledge graph serves as a persistent, dynamically updated memory that incorporates new observations and triggers replanning upon detecting inconsistencies, enabling symbolic plans to adapt to evolving world states. Experiments on the MAT-THOR benchmark show that KGLAMP improves performance by at least 25.5% over both LLM-only and PDDL-based variants.

Conclusion: 运动中心设计教学法成功支持工程师创造富有表现力的机械臂运动，为机器人运动设计提供了有效的跨学科方法

Abstract: As robots increasingly become part of shared human spaces, their movements must transcend basic functionality by incorporating expressive qualities to enhance engagement and communication. This paper introduces a movement-centered design pedagogy designed to support engineers in creating expressive robotic arm movements. Through a hands-on interactive workshop informed by interdisciplinary methodologies, participants explored various creative possibilities, generating valuable insights into expressive motion design. The iterative approach proposed integrates analytical frameworks from dance, enabling designers to examine motion through dynamic and embodied dimensions. A custom manual remote controller facilitates interactive, real-time manipulation of the robotic arm, while dedicated animation software supports visualization, detailed motion sequencing, and precise parameter control. Qualitative analysis of this interactive design process reveals that the proposed "toolbox" effectively bridges the gap between human intent and robotic expressiveness resulting in more intuitive and engaging expressive robotic arm movements.

Abstract: Current 3D scene graph generation (3DSGG) approaches heavily rely on a single-agent assumption and small-scale environments, exhibiting limited scalability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce Multi-Agent 3D Scene Graph Generation (MA3DSG) model, the first framework designed to tackle this scalability challenge using multiple agents. We develop a training-free graph alignment algorithm that efficiently merges partial query graphs from individual agents into a unified global scene graph. Leveraging extensive analysis and empirical insights, our approach enables conventional single-agent systems to operate collaboratively without requiring any learnable parameters. To rigorously evaluate 3DSGG performance, we propose MA3DSG-Bench-a benchmark that supports diverse agent configurations, domain sizes, and environmental conditions-providing a more general and extensible evaluation framework. This work lays a solid foundation for scalable, multi-agent 3DSGG research.

We present a simple, minimal system recipe that pairs a real-time multimodal language model with a small set of tool interfaces for attention and active perception. We study six home-style scenarios that require frequent attention shifts and increasing perceptual scope. Across four system variants, we evaluate turn-level tool-decision correctness against human annotations and collect subjective ratings of interaction quality. Results indicate that real-time multimodal large language models and tool use for active perception is a promising direction for practical situated embodied conversation.

Conclusion: GenMRP成功解决了现有路径规划方法的局限性，提供了一种高效、个性化且多样化的多路径规划框架，在实际工业应用中展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Existing industrial-scale navigation applications contend with massive road networks, typically employing two main categories of approaches for route planning. The first relies on precomputed road costs for optimal routing and heuristic algorithms for generating alternatives, while the second, generative methods, has recently gained significant attention. However, the former struggles with personalization and route diversity, while the latter fails to meet the efficiency requirements of large-scale real-time scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose GenMRP, a generative framework for multi-route planning. To ensure generation efficiency, GenMRP first introduces a skeleton-to-capillary approach that dynamically constructs a relevant sub-network significantly smaller than the full road network. Within this sub-network, routes are generated iteratively. The first iteration identifies the optimal route, while the subsequent ones generate alternatives that balance quality and diversity using the newly proposed correctional boosting approach. Each iteration incorporates road features, user historical sequences, and previously generated routes into a Link Cost Model to update road costs, followed by route generation using the Dijkstra algorithm. Extensive experiments show that GenMRP achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency in both offline and online environments. To facilitate further research, we have publicly released the training and evaluation dataset. GenMRP has been fully deployed in a real-world navigation app, demonstrating its effectiveness and benefits.

Method: 提出SCALE推理策略，基于主动推理理论中的不确定性驱动探索思想，利用"自不确定性"同时调制视觉感知和动作；高不确定性时在感知和动作上广泛探索，高置信度时专注于利用

Result: 在模拟和真实世界基准测试中，SCALE提升了最先进VLA模型的性能，优于现有测试时缩放方法，同时保持单次前向传播的效率

Conclusion: SCALE是一种简单有效的推理策略，无需额外训练或验证器，单次前向传播即可自适应地调制感知和动作，提高VLA模型在不同条件下的鲁棒性和性能

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for general-purpose robotic control, with test-time scaling (TTS) gaining attention to enhance robustness beyond training. However, existing TTS methods for VLAs require additional training, verifiers, and multiple forward passes, making them impractical for deployment. Moreover, they intervene only at action decoding while keeping visual representations fixed-insufficient under perceptual ambiguity, where reconsidering how to perceive is as important as deciding what to do. To address these limitations, we propose SCALE, a simple inference strategy that jointly modulates visual perception and action based on 'self-uncertainty', inspired by uncertainty-driven exploration in Active Inference theory-requiring no additional training, no verifier, and only a single forward pass. SCALE broadens exploration in both perception and action under high uncertainty, while focusing on exploitation when confident-enabling adaptive execution across varying conditions. Experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that SCALE improves state-of-the-art VLAs and outperforms existing TTS methods while maintaining single-pass efficiency.

Motivation: 让机器人能够重排各种大型重物（如家具）可以显著减轻人类工作负担，但由于需要与多样物体交互、在复杂环境中高效重排多个物体并确保无碰撞的移动操作，这一任务极具挑战性。

Abstract: Endowing robots with the ability to rearrange various large and heavy objects, such as furniture, can substantially alleviate human workload. However, this task is extremely challenging due to the need to interact with diverse objects and efficiently rearrange multiple objects in complex environments while ensuring collision-free loco-manipulation. In this work, we present ALORE, an autonomous large-object rearrangement system for a legged manipulator that can rearrange various large objects across diverse scenarios. The proposed system is characterized by three main features: (i) a hierarchical reinforcement learning training pipeline for multi-object environment learning, where a high-level object velocity controller is trained on top of a low-level whole-body controller to achieve efficient and stable joint learning across multiple objects; (ii) two key modules, a unified interaction configuration representation and an object velocity estimator, that allow a single policy to regulate planar velocity of diverse objects accurately; and (iii) a task-and-motion planning framework that jointly optimizes object visitation order and object-to-target assignment, improving task efficiency while enabling online replanning. Comparisons against strong baselines show consistent superiority in policy generalization, object-velocity tracking accuracy, and multi-object rearrangement efficiency. Key modules are systematically evaluated, and extensive simulations and real-world experiments are conducted to validate the robustness and effectiveness of the entire system, which successfully completes 8 continuous loops to rearrange 32 chairs over nearly 40 minutes without a single failure, and executes long-distance autonomous rearrangement over an approximately 40 m route.

TL;DR: 提出Ordered Action Tokenization (OAT)方法，为连续机器人动作提供高效tokenization方案，支持自回归策略，在多个任务中优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 自回归策略为机器人学习提供可扩展基础，但应用于连续动作需要有效的动作tokenization方案。现有方法要么产生过长的token序列，要么缺乏结构，与下一个token预测不兼容。

Method: 提出OAT方法，使用带寄存器的transformer、有限标量量化和排序诱导训练机制，将动作块离散化为有序token序列，满足高压缩、完全可解码和左到右因果有序三个要求。

Result: 在超过20个任务、四个仿真基准和真实世界设置中，配备OAT的自回归策略始终优于先前的tokenization方案和基于扩散的基线，同时在推理时提供更大的灵活性。

Conclusion: OAT为连续机器人动作提供了有效的tokenization方案，支持高效的自回归策略，在性能和推理灵活性方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Autoregressive policies offer a compelling foundation for scalable robot learning by enabling discrete abstraction, token-level reasoning, and flexible inference. However, applying autoregressive modeling to continuous robot actions requires an effective action tokenization scheme. Existing approaches either rely on analytical discretization methods that produce prohibitively long token sequences, or learned latent tokenizers that lack structure, limiting their compatibility with next-token prediction. In this work, we identify three desiderata for action tokenization - high compression, total decodability, and a left-to-right causally ordered token space - and introduce Ordered Action Tokenization (OAT), a learned action tokenizer that satisfies all three. OAT discretizes action chunks into an ordered sequence of tokens using transformer with registers, finite scalar quantization, and ordering-inducing training mechanisms. The resulting token space aligns naturally with autoregressive generation and enables prefix-based detokenization, yielding an anytime trade-off between inference cost and action fidelity. Across more than 20 tasks spanning four simulation benchmarks and real-world settings, autoregressive policies equipped with OAT consistently outperform prior tokenization schemes and diffusion-based baselines, while offering significantly greater flexibility at inference time.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将最小误差熵（MEE）引入视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型，替代传统的均方误差（MSE）用于连续动作回归，通过重塑训练过程中的误差分布来提升机器人策略的性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型主要使用交叉熵和均方误差等监督目标，这些方法对单个预测施加了强烈的逐点约束。作者认为这些传统方法在连续动作回归中可能不是最优的，需要超越MSE的回归方法，通过重塑误差分布来提升模型性能。

Method: 基于信息论原理，将最小误差熵（MEE）引入现代VLA架构，提出了轨迹级MEE目标及其两个加权变体，并与MSE结合用于连续动作VLA训练。该方法在训练过程中优化误差分布而非仅仅最小化点误差。

Result: 在LIBERO、SimplerEnv等仿真基准和真实世界机器人操作任务中，该方法在标准、少样本和噪声设置下均表现出性能提升。在数据不平衡情况下，在特定操作范围内保持增益，同时训练成本增加可忽略，推理效率不受影响。

Conclusion: MEE监督比传统MSE方法更有效，能提升VLA模型的成功率和鲁棒性。论文提供了理论分析解释MEE的有效性并界定了其实际应用范围，为连续动作VLA训练提供了新的监督范式。

Abstract: In robotic manipulation, vision-language-action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for learning generalizable and scalable robot policies. Most existing VLA frameworks rely on standard supervised objectives, typically cross-entropy for discrete actions and mean squared error (MSE) for continuous action regression, which impose strong pointwise constraints on individual predictions. In this work, we focus on continuous-action VLA models and move beyond conventional MSE-based regression by reshaping action error distributions during training. Drawing on information-theoretic principles, we introduce Minimum Error Entropy (MEE) into modern VLA architectures and propose a trajectory-level MEE objective, together with two weighted variants, combined with MSE for continuous-action VLA training. We evaluate our approaches across standard, few-shot, and noisy settings on multiple representative VLA architectures, using simulation benchmarks such as LIBERO and SimplerEnv as well as real-world robotic manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in success rates and robustness across these settings. Under imbalanced data regimes, the gains persist within a well-characterized operating range, while incurring negligible additional training cost and no impact on inference efficiency. We further provide theoretical analyses that explain why MEE-based supervision is effective and characterize its practical range.

Abstract: Language-guided grasping has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling robots to identify and manipulate target objects through natural language instructions, yet it remains highly challenging in cluttered or occluded scenes. Existing methods often rely on multi-stage pipelines that separate object perception and grasping, which leads to limited cross-modal fusion, redundant computation, and poor generalization in cluttered, occluded, or low-texture scenes. To address these limitations, we propose GeoLanG, an end-to-end multi-task framework built upon the CLIP architecture that unifies visual and linguistic inputs into a shared representation space for robust semantic alignment and improved generalization. To enhance target discrimination under occlusion and low-texture conditions, we explore a more effective use of depth information through the Depth-guided Geometric Module (DGGM), which converts depth into explicit geometric priors and injects them into the attention mechanism without additional computational overhead. In addition, we propose Adaptive Dense Channel Integration, which adaptively balances the contributions of multi-layer features to produce more discriminative and generalizable visual representations. Extensive experiments on the OCID-VLG dataset, as well as in both simulation and real-world hardware, demonstrate that GeoLanG enables precise and robust language-guided grasping in complex, cluttered environments, paving the way toward more reliable multimodal robotic manipulation in real-world human-centric settings.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation continues to be a challenge, and imitation learning (IL) enables robots to learn tasks from expert demonstrations. Current IL methods typically rely on fixed camera setups, where cameras are manually positioned in static locations, imposing significant limitations on adaptability and coverage. Inspired by human active perception, where humans dynamically adjust their viewpoint to capture the most relevant and least noisy information, we propose MAE-Select, a novel framework for active viewpoint selection in single-camera robotic systems. MAE-Select fully leverages pre-trained multi-view masked autoencoder representations and dynamically selects the next most informative viewpoint at each time chunk without requiring labeled viewpoints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAE-Select improves the capabilities of single-camera systems and, in some cases, even surpasses multi-camera setups.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising paradigm integrating perception, decision-making, and control within a unified learning framework. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained significant attention for their potential to enhance the robustness and generalization of end-to-end driving models in diverse and unseen scenarios. However, existing VLM-based approaches still face challenges, including suboptimal lane perception, language understanding biases, and difficulties in handling corner cases. To address these issues, we propose AppleVLM, an advanced perception and planning-enhanced VLM model for robust end-to-end driving. AppleVLM introduces a novel vision encoder and a planning strategy encoder to improve perception and decision-making. Firstly, the vision encoder fuses spatial-temporal information from multi-view images across multiple timesteps using a deformable transformer mechanism, enhancing robustness to camera variations and facilitating scalable deployment across different vehicle platforms. Secondly, unlike traditional VLM-based approaches, AppleVLM introduces a dedicated planning modality that encodes explicit Bird's-Eye-View spatial information, mitigating language biases in navigation instructions. Finally, a VLM decoder fine-tuned by a hierarchical Chain-of-Thought integrates vision, language, and planning features to output robust driving waypoints. We evaluate AppleVLM in closed-loop experiments on two CARLA benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art driving performance. Furthermore, we deploy AppleVLM on an AGV platform and successfully showcase real-world end-to-end autonomous driving in complex outdoor environments.

Method: 提出三层分层VLA模型：高层ASM微调感知场景图像关键点可操作性；中层3DAgent进行任务理解、技能知识和轨迹规划，生成3D末端执行器轨迹；低层3D感知控制策略执行精确操作。无需真实机器人数据或人工演示。

Conclusion: GeneralVLA是生成机器人数据和零样本解决新任务的可扩展方法，通过知识引导轨迹规划有效利用基础模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is that the models exhibit limited zero-shot capability, which hampers their ability to generalize effectively to unseen scenarios. In this work, we propose GeneralVLA (Generalizable Vision-Language-Action Models with Knowledge-Guided Trajectory Planning), a hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) model that can be more effective in utilizing the generalization of foundation models, enabling zero-shot manipulation and automatically generating data for robotics. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA model where the high-level ASM (Affordance Segmentation Module) is finetuned to perceive image keypoint affordances of the scene; the mid-level 3DAgent carries out task understanding, skill knowledge, and trajectory planning to produce a 3D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory. The intermediate 3D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Compared to alternative approaches, our method requires no real-world robotic data collection or human demonstration, making it much more scalable to diverse tasks and viewpoints. Empirically, GeneralVLA successfully generates trajectories for 14 tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as VoxPoser. The generated demonstrations can train more robust behavior cloning policies than training with human demonstrations or from data generated by VoxPoser, Scaling-up, and Code-As-Policies. We believe GeneralVLA can be the scalable method for both generating data for robotics and solving novel tasks in a zero-shot setting. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/GeneralVLA.

Abstract: Achieving safe and stylized trajectory planning in complex real-world scenarios remains a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems. This paper proposes the SDD Planner, a diffusion-based framework designed to effectively reconcile safety constraints with driving styles in real time. The framework integrates two core modules: a Multi-Source Style-Aware Encoder, which employs distance-sensitive attention to fuse dynamic agent data and environmental contexts for heterogeneous safety-style perception; and a Style-Guided Dynamic Trajectory Generator, which adaptively modulates priority weights within the diffusion denoising process to generate user-preferred yet safe trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDD Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the StyleDrive benchmark, it improves the SM-PDMS metric by 3.9% over WoTE, the strongest baseline. Furthermore, on the NuPlan Test14 and Test14-hard benchmarks, SDD Planner ranks first with overall scores of 91.76 and 80.32, respectively, outperforming leading methods such as PLUTO. Real-vehicle closed-loop tests further confirm that SDD Planner maintains high safety standards while aligning with preset driving styles, validating its practical applicability for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 当前视觉地点识别系统通常需要手动调整匹配阈值，这些阈值在特定环境下离线调优并在部署时固定，导致环境变化时性能下降。需要一种能自动适应新环境并跨操作条件泛化的方法。

Method: 使用带有已知对应关系的小型校准遍历数据，通过相似度分数分布的分位数归一化将阈值从校准环境转移到部署环境。这种方法确保阈值在校准大小和查询子集间保持稳定，对采样变异性具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够根据用户定义的精度要求自动选择VPR系统的最佳操作点，通过分位数转移技术确保阈值稳定性，显著提升视觉地点识别系统在环境变化下的性能表现。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a key component for localisation in GNSS-denied environments, but its performance critically depends on selecting an image matching threshold (operating point) that balances precision and recall. Thresholds are typically hand-tuned offline for a specific environment and fixed during deployment, leading to degraded performance under environmental change. We propose a method that, given a user-defined precision requirement, automatically selects the operating point of a VPR system to maximise recall. The method uses a small calibration traversal with known correspondences and transfers thresholds to deployment via quantile normalisation of similarity score distributions. This quantile transfer ensures that thresholds remain stable across calibration sizes and query subsets, making the method robust to sampling variability. Experiments with multiple state-of-the-art VPR techniques and datasets show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art, delivering up to 25% higher recall in high-precision operating regimes. The method eliminates manual tuning by adapting to new environments and generalising across operating conditions. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Humanoid robots can suffer significant performance drops under small changes in dynamics, task specifications, or environment setup. We propose HoRD, a two-stage learning framework for robust humanoid control under domain shift. First, we train a high-performance teacher policy via history-conditioned reinforcement learning, where the policy infers latent dynamics context from recent state--action trajectories to adapt online to diverse randomized dynamics. Second, we perform online distillation to transfer the teacher's robust control capabilities into a transformer-based student policy that operates on sparse root-relative 3D joint keypoint trajectories. By combining history-conditioned adaptation with online distillation, HoRD enables a single policy to adapt zero-shot to unseen domains without per-domain retraining. Extensive experiments show HoRD outperforms strong baselines in robustness and transfer, especially under unseen domains and external perturbations.

Abstract: In partially known environments, robots must combine exploration to gather information with task planning for efficient execution. To address this challenge, we propose EPoG, an Exploration-based sequential manipulation Planning framework on Scene Graphs. EPoG integrates a graph-based global planner with a Large Language Model (LLM)-based situated local planner, continuously updating a belief graph using observations and LLM predictions to represent known and unknown objects. Action sequences are generated by computing graph edit operations between the goal and belief graphs, ordered by temporal dependencies and movement costs. This approach seamlessly combines exploration and sequential manipulation planning. In ablation studies across 46 realistic household scenes and 5 long-horizon daily object transportation tasks, EPoG achieved a success rate of 91.3%, reducing travel distance by 36.1% on average. Furthermore, a physical mobile manipulator successfully executed complex tasks in unknown and dynamic environments, demonstrating EPoG's potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Unmanned underwater vehicles are increasingly employed for maintenance and surveying tasks at sea, but their operation in shallow waters is often hindered by hydrodynamic disturbances such as waves, currents, and turbulence. These unsteady flows can induce rapid changes in direction and speed, compromising vehicle stability and manoeuvrability. Marine organisms contend with such conditions by combining proprioceptive feedback with flexible fins and tails to reject disturbances. Inspired by this strategy, we propose soft morphing wings endowed with proprioceptive sensing to mitigate environmental perturbations. The wing's continuous deformation provides a natural means to infer dynamic disturbances: sudden changes in camber directly reflect variations in the oncoming flow. By interpreting this proprioceptive signal, a disturbance observer can reconstruct flow parameters in real time. To enable this, we develop and experimentally validate a dynamic model of a hydraulically actuated soft wing with controllable camber. We then show that curvature-based sensing allows accurate estimation of disturbances in the angle of attack. Finally, we demonstrate that a controller leveraging these proprioceptive estimates can reject disturbances in the lift response of the soft wing. By combining proprioceptive sensing with a disturbance observer, this technique mirrors biological strategies and provides a pathway for soft underwater vehicles to maintain stability in hazardous environments.

Abstract: Deploying humanoid robots in real-world settings is fundamentally challenging, as it demands tight integration of perception, locomotion, and manipulation under partial-information observations and dynamically changing environments. As well as transitioning robustly between sub-tasks of different types. Towards addressing these challenges, we propose a novel task - EgoActing, which requires directly grounding high-level instructions into various, precise, spatially aware humanoid actions. We further instantiate this task by introducing EgoActor, a unified and scalable vision-language model (VLM) that can predict locomotion primitives (e.g., walk, turn, move sideways, change height), head movements, manipulation commands, and human-robot interactions to coordinate perception and execution in real-time. We leverage broad supervision over egocentric RGB-only data from real-world demonstrations, spatial reasoning question-answering, and simulated environment demonstrations, enabling EgoActor to make robust, context-aware decisions and perform fluent action inference (under 1s) with both 8B and 4B parameter models. Extensive evaluations in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that EgoActor effectively bridges abstract task planning and concrete motor execution, while generalizing across diverse tasks and unseen environments.

Conclusion: TACO提供了一个无需存储或回放历史数据的持续神经建图解决方案，有效解决了动态机器人环境下的自适应建图问题

Abstract: Neural implicit mapping has emerged as a powerful paradigm for robotic navigation and scene understanding. However, real-world robotic deployment requires continual adaptation to changing environments under strict memory and computation constraints, which existing mapping systems fail to support. Most prior methods rely on replaying historical observations to preserve consistency and assume static scenes. As a result, they cannot adapt to continual learning in dynamic robotic settings. To address these challenges, we propose TACO (TemporAl Consensus Optimization), a replay-free framework for continual neural mapping. We reformulate mapping as a temporal consensus optimization problem, where we treat past model snapshots as temporal neighbors. Intuitively, our approach resembles a model consulting its own past knowledge. We update the current map by enforcing weighted consensus with historical representations. Our method allows reliable past geometry to constrain optimization while permitting unreliable or outdated regions to be revised in response to new observations. TACO achieves a balance between memory efficiency and adaptability without storing or replaying previous data. Through extensive simulated and real-world experiments, we show that TACO robustly adapts to scene changes, and consistently outperforms other continual learning baselines.

Conclusion: Unicomp框架提供了一个统一的离散时间预测模型，通过二次约束关联广义速度和接触力，适合实时优化规划，解决了现有方法在接触模式转换和复杂接触表示方面的局限性

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires planners to reason jointly about free-space motion and sustained, frictional contact with the environment. Existing (local) planning and simulation frameworks typically separate these regimes or rely on simplified contact representations, particularly when modeling non-convex or distributed contact patches. Such approximations limit the fidelity of contact-mode transitions and hinder the robust execution of contact-rich behaviors in real time. This paper presents a unified discrete-time modeling framework for robotic manipulation that consistently captures both free motion and frictional contact within a single mathematical formalism (Unicomp). Building on complementarity-based rigid-body dynamics, we formulate free-space motion and contact interactions as coupled linear and nonlinear complementarity problems, enabling principled transitions between contact modes without enforcing fixed-contact assumptions. For planar patch contact, we derive a frictional contact model from the maximum power dissipation principle in which the set of admissible contact wrenches is represented by an ellipsoidal limit surface. This representation captures coupled force-moment effects, including torsional friction, while remaining agnostic to the underlying pressure distribution across the contact patch. The resulting formulation yields a discrete-time predictive model that relates generalized velocities and contact wrenches through quadratic constraints and is suitable for real-time optimization-based planning. Experimental results show that the proposed approach enables stable, physically consistent behavior at interactive speeds across tasks, from planar pushing to contact-rich whole-body maneuvers.

Abstract: Achieving generalizable manipulation in unconstrained environments requires the robot to proactively resolve information uncertainty, i.e., the capability of active perception. However, existing methods are often confined in limited types of sensing behaviors, restricting their applicability to complex environments. In this work, we formalize active perception as a non-Markovian process driven by information gain and decision branching, providing a structured categorization of visual active perception paradigms. Building on this perspective, we introduce CoMe-VLA, a cognitive and memory-aware vision-language-action (VLA) framework that leverages large-scale human egocentric data to learn versatile exploration and manipulation priors. Our framework integrates a cognitive auxiliary head for autonomous sub-task transitions and a dual-track memory system to maintain consistent self and environmental awareness by fusing proprioceptive and visual temporal contexts. By aligning human and robot hand-eye coordination behaviors in a unified egocentric action space, we train the model progressively in three stages. Extensive experiments on a wheel-based humanoid have demonstrated strong robustness and adaptability of our proposed method across diverse long-horizon tasks spanning multiple active perception scenarios.

TL;DR: 软肩外骨骼第二版通过重新设计提升舒适性和功能性，支持前臂定位和横向平面活动度，同时保持辅助性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肩部活动受限影响上肢功能和日常生活活动。虽然可穿戴外骨骼在辅助手臂抬高方面有潜力，但舒适性很少被作为明确设计目标，而舒适性对长期实际使用至关重要。

Method: 重新设计软肩外骨骼（Soft Shoulder v2），解决先前版本舒适性限制，同时改进辅助功能，从冠状平面转向矢状平面以更好支持功能性手部定位。在8名健康参与者中进行v1和v2的对照比较，评估静态保持、动态抬起和功能性取放任务。

Result: 两个版本都增加了耐力时间，减少了三角肌激活，并在无动力肩部抬高时保持了透明度。但v2在功能性任务和舒适性评估中表现更优：促进前臂定位，增加横向平面活动度达30度，不增加肌肉需求。用户报告显示穿戴性显著改善，感知压力更低，有效性、易用性和舒适性评分更高。

Conclusion: 有针对性的、以用户为中心的设计改进可以在不损害辅助性能的情况下提升舒适性和功能性互动，推动适合长期日常使用的软外骨骼发展。

Abstract: Reduced shoulder mobility limits upper-limb function and the performance of activities of daily living across a wide range of conditions. Wearable exosuits have shown promise in assisting arm elevation, reducing muscle effort, and supporting functional movements; however, comfort is rarely prioritized as an explicit design objective, despite it strongly affects real-life, long-term usage. This study presents a redesigned soft shoulder exosuit (Soft Shoulder v2) developed to address comfort-related limitations identified in our previous version, while preserving assistive performance. In parallel, assistance was also improved, shifting from the coronal plane to the sagittal plane to better support functionally relevant hand positioning. A controlled comparison between the previous (v1) and redesigned (v2) modules was conducted in eight healthy participants, who performed static holding, dynamic lifting, and a functional pick and place task. Muscle activity, kinematics, and user-reported outcomes were assessed. Both versions increased endurance time, reduced deltoid activation, and preserved transparency during unpowered shoulder elevation. However, the difference between them emerged most clearly during functional tasks and comfort evaluation. The redesigned module facilitated forward arm positioning and increased transverse plane mobility by up to 30 deg, without increasing muscular demand. User-reported outcomes further indicated a substantial improvement in wearability, with markedly lower perceived pressure and higher ratings in effectiveness, ease of use, and comfort compared to the previous design. Taken together, these findings show that targeted, user-centered design refinements can improve comfort and functional interaction without compromising assistive performance, advancing the development of soft exosuits suitable for prolonged and daily use.

Abstract: Recently, the progress in the radar sensing technology consisting in the miniaturization of the packages and increase in measuring precision has drawn the interest of the robotics research community. Indeed, a crucial task enabling autonomy in robotics is to precisely determine the pose of the robot in space. To fulfill this task sensor fusion algorithms are often used, in which data from one or several exteroceptive sensors like, for example, LiDAR, camera, laser ranging sensor or GNSS are fused together with the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements to obtain an estimate of the navigation states of the robot. Nonetheless, owing to their particular sensing principles, some exteroceptive sensors are often incapacitated in extreme environmental conditions, like extreme illumination or presence of fine particles in the environment like smoke or fog. Radars are largely immune to aforementioned factors thanks to the characteristics of electromagnetic waves they use. In this thesis, we present Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) algorithms to fuse the information from IMU and radar in order to estimate the navigation states of a (Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle) UAV capable of running on a portable resource-constrained embedded computer in real-time and making use of inexpensive, consumer-grade sensors. We present novel RIO approaches relying on the multi-state tightly-coupled Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Factor Graphs (FG) fusing instantaneous velocities of and distances to 3D points delivered by a lightweight, low-cost, off-the-shelf Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar with IMU readings. We also show a novel way to exploit advances in deep learning to retrieve 3D point correspondences in sparse and noisy radar point clouds.

TL;DR: 论文研究如何通过将开放或封闭词汇的空间关系融入3D场景图，来提升大语言模型理解自然语言指令的能力，特别是在机器人目标物体定位任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人在人类环境中应用日益广泛，需要更自然的人机交互。理解自然语言指令需要机器人推断意图任务、分解为可执行动作，并将这些动作在环境知识中定位。现有3D场景图缺乏显式的空间关系，而人类描述环境时常依赖这些关系。

Method: 提出基于LLM的管道用于从开放词汇语言指令中定位目标物体，以及基于视觉语言模型(VLM)的管道从机器人采集的图像中为3D场景图添加开放词汇空间边。最后评估两个LLM在目标物体定位下游任务中的表现。

Result: 研究表明显式空间关系确实能提升LLM定位物体的能力。同时，使用VLM从机器人采集图像生成开放词汇关系是可行的，但其相对于封闭词汇关系的优势有限。

Conclusion: 将空间关系融入3D场景图能有效提升LLM理解自然语言指令的能力，特别是在机器人目标物体定位任务中。虽然开放词汇关系生成可行，但实际优势不如预期明显。

Abstract: Robots are finding wider adoption in human environments, increasing the need for natural human-robot interaction. However, understanding a natural language command requires the robot to infer the intended task and how to decompose it into executable actions, and to ground those actions in the robot's knowledge of the environment, including relevant objects, agents, and locations. This challenge can be addressed by combining the capabilities of Large language models (LLMs) to understand natural language with 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) for grounding inferred actions in a semantic representation of the environment. However, many 3DSGs lack explicit spatial relations between objects, even though humans often rely on these relations to describe an environment. This paper investigates whether incorporating open- or closed-vocabulary spatial relations into 3DSGs can improve the ability of LLMs to interpret natural language commands. To address this, we propose an LLM-based pipeline for target object grounding from open-vocabulary language commands and a vision language model (VLM)-based pipeline to add open-vocabulary spatial edges to 3DSGs from images captured while mapping. Finally, two LLMs are evaluated in a study assessing their performance on the downstream task of target object grounding. Our study demonstrates that explicit spatial relations improve the ability of LLMs to ground objects. Moreover, open-vocabulary relation generation with VLMs proves feasible from robot-captured images, but their advantage over closed-vocabulary relations is found to be limited.

TL;DR: 提出基于视觉门控控制的主动腰部外骨骼系统，通过第一人称视角和注视跟踪实现实时抓握检测，显著降低感知体力负荷并提升用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有背部支撑外骨骼系统主要依赖负载估计技术（如EMG、IMU）或视觉系统，但这些方法不能直接为控制提供信息。需要一种能够及时提供情境感知辅助的系统来有效减轻工业搬运中的脊柱负荷。

Method: 开发了基于第一人称YOLO感知系统的实时抓握检测、用于任务进展的有限状态机（FSM），以及根据姿势和物体状态调整扭矩输出的可变导纳控制器，构建了视觉门控控制框架。

Result: 15名参与者的用户研究表明，视觉门控辅助显著降低了感知体力需求，提高了流畅性、信任度和舒适度。定量分析显示启用视觉时辅助更早更强，问卷结果确认用户偏好视觉门控模式。

Conclusion: 第一人称视角视觉能够增强背部支撑外骨骼的响应性、人体工学、安全性和接受度，为工业外骨骼系统提供了有前景的发展方向。

Abstract: Back-support exoskeletons have been proposed to mitigate spinal loading in industrial handling, yet their effectiveness critically depends on timely and context-aware assistance. Most existing approaches rely either on load-estimation techniques (e.g., EMG, IMU) or on vision systems that do not directly inform control. In this work, we present a vision-gated control framework for an active lumbar occupational exoskeleton that leverages egocentric vision with wearable gaze tracking. The proposed system integrates real-time grasp detection from a first-person YOLO-based perception system, a finite-state machine (FSM) for task progression, and a variable admittance controller to adapt torque delivery to both posture and object state. A user study with 15 participants performing stooping load lifting trials under three conditions (no exoskeleton, exoskeleton without vision, exoskeleton with vision) shows that vision-gated assistance significantly reduces perceived physical demand and improves fluency, trust, and comfort. Quantitative analysis reveals earlier and stronger assistance when vision is enabled, while questionnaire results confirm user preference for the vision-gated mode. These findings highlight the potential of egocentric vision to enhance the responsiveness, ergonomics, safety, and acceptance of back-support exoskeletons.

TL;DR: 对1980-2024年机器人学文献中"枯燥、肮脏、危险"（DDD）概念使用的实证分析，发现仅有少量研究明确定义或提供具体DDD任务案例，提出基于社会科学文献的DDD概念框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人学领域长期使用"枯燥、肮脏、危险"（DDD）工作作为机器人应用的正当性理由，但缺乏对DDD概念的明确定义和实证基础，需要建立更严谨的概念框架来指导机器人技术对人类劳动的影响评估。

Method: 1. 对1980-2024年提及DDD的机器人学文献进行实证分析；2. 回顾社会科学文献中对"枯燥"、"肮脏"、"危险"工作的研究；3. 提出帮助机器人学界考虑工作背景的概念框架。

Result: 实证分析显示：仅2.7%的文献明确定义DDD，仅8.7%提供具体的DDD任务或工作案例。通过社会科学文献回顾，为DDD提供了更严谨的定义和概念化指导。

Conclusion: 机器人学界需要超越简单的DDD口号，建立更系统的工作背景分析框架，以更全面地评估机器人技术对人类劳动的影响，促进更负责任的技术发展。

Abstract: In robotics, the concept of "dull, dirty, and dangerous" (DDD) work has been used to motivate where robots might be useful. In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis of robotics publications between 1980 and 2024 that mention DDD, and find that only 2.7% of publications define DDD and 8.7% of publications provide concrete examples of tasks or jobs that are DDD. We then review the social science literature on "dull," "dirty," and "dangerous" work to provide definitions and guidance on how to conceptualize DDD for robotics. Finally, we propose a framework that helps the robotics community consider the job context for our technology, encouraging a more informed perspective on how robotics may impact human labor.

Motivation: 姿态和运动先验在人形机器人中至关重要，虽然人类运动恢复领域已有多种模型，但由于高质量人形机器人运动数据稀缺，这些先验在人形机器人中的应用仍然有限。

Method: 提出姿态距离场（PDF-HR），将机器人姿态分布表示为连续可微的流形，对任意姿态预测其到大规模重定向机器人姿态的距离，产生平滑的姿态合理性度量。

Result: 在单轨迹运动跟踪、通用运动跟踪、基于风格的运动模仿和通用运动重定向等任务上评估PDF-HR，实验表明该即插即用先验能持续显著增强强基线方法。

Conclusion: PDF-HR是一个轻量级、可微的姿态先验，可灵活集成到各种机器人控制管道中，有效提升人形机器人运动任务的性能。

Abstract: Pose and motion priors play a crucial role in humanoid robotics. Although such priors have been widely studied in human motion recovery (HMR) domain with a range of models, their adoption for humanoid robots remains limited, largely due to the scarcity of high-quality humanoid motion data. In this work, we introduce Pose Distance Fields for Humanoid Robots (PDF-HR), a lightweight prior that represents the robot pose distribution as a continuous and differentiable manifold. Given an arbitrary pose, PDF-HR predicts its distance to a large corpus of retargeted robot poses, yielding a smooth measure of pose plausibility that is well suited for optimization and control. PDF-HR can be integrated as a reward shaping term, a regularizer, or a standalone plausibility scorer across diverse pipelines. We evaluate PDF-HR on various humanoid tasks, including single-trajectory motion tracking, general motion tracking, style-based motion mimicry, and general motion retargeting. Experiments show that this plug-and-play prior consistently and substantially strengthens strong baselines. Code and models will be released.

Conclusion: 研究为支持可泛化操作的表示特性提供了见解，表明学习编码环境的潜在物理状态是控制的有前景目标

Abstract: The choice of visual representation is key to scaling generalist robot policies. However, direct evaluation via policy rollouts is expensive, even in simulation. Existing proxy metrics focus on the representation's capacity to capture narrow aspects of the visual world, like object shape, limiting generalization across environments. In this paper, we take an analytical perspective: we probe pretrained visual encoders by measuring how well they support decoding of environment state -- including geometry, object structure, and physical attributes -- from images. Leveraging simulation environments with access to ground-truth state, we show that this probing accuracy strongly correlates with downstream policy performance across diverse environments and learning settings, significantly outperforming prior metrics and enabling efficient representation selection. More broadly, our study provides insight into the representational properties that support generalizable manipulation, suggesting that learning to encode the latent physical state of the environment is a promising objective for control.
