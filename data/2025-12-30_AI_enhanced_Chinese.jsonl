However, ensuring good Quality of Services (QoS) while using as few UAVs as possible also requires optimal positioning and trajectory planning for UAVs and UGVs. This paper proposes a joint UAV-UGV-based positioning and trajectory planning framework for UAVs and UGVs deployment that guarantees optimal QoS for ground users. To model the UGVs' mobility, we introduce a road graph, which directs their movement along valid road segments and adheres to the road network constraints. To solve the sum rate optimization problem, we reformulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) incorporated with meta-learning for rapid adaptation to new environments and dynamic conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed Meta-A3C approach outperforms A3C and DDPG, delivering 13.1\\% higher throughput and 49\\% faster execution while meeting the QoS requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u4f18\u52bf\u6f14\u5458-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7b97\u6cd5(Meta-A3C)\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u8054\u5408\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u707e\u540e\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u707e\u540e\u901a\u4fe1\u6062\u590d\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u8054\u5408\u90e8\u7f72\u5df2\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "1) \u5f15\u5165\u9053\u8def\u56fe\u6a21\u578bUGV\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6cbf\u6709\u6548\u8def\u6bb5\u79fb\u52a8\u5e76\u9075\u5b88\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b2) \u5c06\u548c\u901f\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u4f18\u52bf\u6f14\u5458-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7b97\u6cd5(Meta-A3C)\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMeta-A3C\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8eA3C\u548cDDPG\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad813.1%\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u52a0\u5feb49%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Meta-A3C\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u8054\u5408\u90e8\u7f72\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u707e\u540e\u901a\u4fe1\u6062\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Under this idealized setting, agents are required solely to produce effective navigation outputs conditioned on vision and language inputs. However, real-world navigation instructions are often vague and ambiguous, requiring the agent to resolve uncertainty and infer user intent through active dialog. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Instance Object Navigation (IION), a task that requires agents not only to generate navigation actions but also to produce language outputs via active dialog, thereby aligning more closely with practical settings. IION extends Instance Object Navigation (ION) by allowing agents to freely consult an oracle in natural language while navigating. Building on this task, we present the Vision Language-Language Navigation (VL-LN) benchmark, which provides a large-scale, automatically generated dataset and a comprehensive evaluation protocol for training and assessing dialog-enabled navigation models. VL-LN comprises over 41k long-horizon dialog-augmented trajectories for training and an automatic evaluation protocol with an oracle capable of responding to agent queries. Using this benchmark, we train a navigation model equipped with dialog capabilities and show that it achieves significant improvements over the baselines. Extensive experiments and analyses further demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of VL-LN for advancing research on dialog-enabled embodied navigation.

It is appealing to consider whether some of this data can come from human videos, which cover diverse real-world situations and are easy to obtain. However, it is difficult to train VLAs with human videos alone, and establishing a mapping between humans and robots requires manual engineering and presents a major research challenge. Drawing inspiration from advances in large language models, where the ability to learn from diverse supervision emerges with scale, we ask whether a similar phenomenon holds for VLAs that incorporate human video data. We introduce a simple co-training recipe, and find that human-to-robot transfer emerges once the VLA is pre-trained on sufficient scenes, tasks, and embodiments. Our analysis suggests that this emergent capability arises because diverse pretraining produces embodiment-agnostic representations for human and robot data. We validate these findings through a series of experiments probing human to robot skill transfer and find that with sufficiently diverse robot pre-training our method can nearly double the performance on generalization settings seen only in human data.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLA\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u673a\u6280\u80fd\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5de5\u7a0b\u6620\u5c04", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u673a\u6620\u5c04\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u6a21\u6548\u5e94\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd9\u79cd\u6620\u5c04", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8db3\u591f\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5177\u8eab\u5f62\u6001\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8ba9\u4eba\u673a\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u81ea\u7136\u6d8c\u73b0", "result": "\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ea7\u751f\u5177\u8eab\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u4eba\u673a\u6280\u80fd\u8fc1\u79fb\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff1b\u5728\u4ec5\u6709\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u8fd1\u4e00\u500d", "conclusion": "VLA\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u4eba\u673a\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u6548\u5e94\u5728VLA\u9886\u57df\u540c\u6837\u5b58\u5728"}}

Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA and Mistral, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Moxin 7B is introduced as a fully open-source LLM developed in accordance with the Model Openness Framework, which moves beyond the simple sharing of model weights to embrace complete transparency in training, datasets, and implementation detail, thus fostering a more inclusive and collaborative research environment that can sustain a healthy open-source ecosystem. To further equip Moxin with various capabilities in different tasks, we develop three variants based on Moxin, including Moxin-VLM, Moxin-VLA, and Moxin-Chinese, which target the vision-language, vision-language-action, and Chinese capabilities, respectively.

The perception of each individual is highly localized, as is its ability to interact with others. While natural collective motion is robust, most artificial swarms are brittle. This particularly occurs when vision is used as the sensing modality, due to ambiguities and information-loss inherent in visual perception. This paper presents mechanisms for robust collective motion inspired by studies of locusts. First, we develop a robust distance estimation method that combines visually perceived horizontal and vertical sizes of neighbors. Second, we introduce intermittent locomotion as a mechanism that allows robots to reliably detect peers that fail to keep up, and disrupt the motion of the swarm. We show how such faulty robots can be avoided in a manner that is robust to errors in classifying them as faulty. Through extensive physics-based simulation experiments, we show dramatic improvements to swarm resilience when using these techniques. We show these are relevant to both distance-based Avoid-Attract models, as well as to models relying on Alignment, in a wide range of experiment settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u6c34\u5e73\u5782\u76f4\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u95f4\u6b47\u8fd0\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u7fa4\u4f53\u97e7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u7136\u7fa4\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u5de5\u7fa4\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u8757\u866b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u7075\u611f\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u7fa4\u4f53\u97e7\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u90bb\u5c45\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u5782\u76f4\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2. \u95f4\u6b47\u8fd0\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8ba9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u843d\u540e\u540c\u4f34\u5e76\u4e2d\u65ad\u7fa4\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6545\u969c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u907f\u8ba9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7fa4\u4f53\u97e7\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u907f\u8ba9-\u5438\u5f15\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5747\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ece\u8757\u866b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7fa4\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u7fa4\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate whether sentence embeddings encode a graded, hierarchical structure aligned with human-interpretable cognitive or psychological attributes. We construct a dataset of 480 natural-language sentences annotated with continuous ordinal energy scores and discrete tier labels spanning seven ordered cognitive categories. Using fixed sentence embeddings from multiple transformer models, we evaluate the recoverability of these annotations via linear and shallow nonlinear probes. Across models, both continuous scores and tier labels are reliably decodable, with shallow nonlinear probes providing consistent performance gains over linear probes. Lexical TF-IDF baselines perform substantially worse, indicating that the observed structure is not attributable to surface word statistics alone. Nonparametric permutation tests further confirm that probe performance exceeds chance under label-randomization nulls. Qualitative analyses using UMAP visualizations and confusion matrices reveal smooth low-to-high gradients and predominantly adjacent-tier confusions in embedding space. Taken together, these results provide evidence that transformer embedding spaces exhibit a hierarchical geometric organization aligned with human-defined cognitive attributes, while remaining agnostic to claims of internal awareness or phenomenology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0Transformer\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c5e\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6d45\u5c42\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eTransformer\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5176\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u66f4\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u4ecd\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u53e5\u5b50\u5d4c\u5165\u662f\u5426\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6216\u5fc3\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5206\u7ea7\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b480\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6807\u6ce8\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u5e8f\u6570\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u6570\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u5c42\u7ea7\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e03\u4e2a\u6709\u5e8f\u8ba4\u77e5\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2aTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u53e5\u5b50\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u6d45\u5c42\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6027\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8bcd\u6c47TF-IDF\u57fa\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u7f6e\u6362\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u662f\u5426\u8d85\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u5206\u6570\u548c\u5c42\u7ea7\u6807\u7b7e\u90fd\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u6d45\u5c42\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u76f8\u6bd4\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u8bcd\u6c47TF-IDF\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u66f4\u5dee\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ec5\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u8868\u9762\u8bcd\u6c47\u7edf\u8ba1\u3002\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u7f6e\u6362\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u786e\u8ba4\u63a2\u9488\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\u3002UMAP\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u6df7\u6dc6\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u4f4e\u5230\u9ad8\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u76f8\u90bb\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660eTransformer\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b9a\u4e49\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c5e\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u610f\u8bc6\u6216\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u4e3b\u5f20\u7684\u4e2d\u7acb\u6001\u5ea6\u3002"}}

A key class of such motility maps arises from (possibly anisotropic) linear drag acting on the system's individual body parts, formally described via Riemannian metrics on the motions of the system's individual body parts. The motility map can then be generated by invoking a sub-Riemannian constraint on the aggregate system motion under which the position velocity induced by a given shape velocity is that which minimizes the power dissipated via friction. The locomotion of such systems is ``geometric'' in the sense that the final position reached by the system depends only on the sequence of shapes that the system passes through, but not on the rate with which the shape changes are made.\n  In this paper, we consider a far more general class of systems in which the drag may be not only anisotropic (with different coefficients for forward/backward and left/right motions), but also asymmetric (with different coefficients for forward and backward motions). Formally, including asymmetry in the friction replaces the Riemannian metrics on the body parts with Finsler metrics. We demonstrate that the sub-Riemannian approach to constructing the system motility map extends naturally to a sub-Finslerian approach and identify system properties analogous to the constraint curvature of sub-Riemannian systems that allow for the characterization of the system motion capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u9ece\u66fc\u5ea6\u91cf\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u82ac\u65af\u52d2\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u4e14\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u963b\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5b50\u82ac\u65af\u52d2\u8fd0\u52a8\u6620\u5c04\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u51e0\u4f55\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u5904\u7406\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7ebf\u6027\u963b\u529b\uff08\u9ece\u66fc\u5ea6\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u963b\u529b\u5f80\u5f80\u662f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\uff08\u5982\u5411\u524d\u548c\u5411\u540e\u963b\u529b\u4e0d\u540c\uff09\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u963b\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9ece\u66fc\u5ea6\u91cf\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u82ac\u65af\u52d2\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5c06\u5b50\u9ece\u66fc\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5b50\u82ac\u65af\u52d2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u52a8\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7ea6\u675f\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u6027\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b50\u82ac\u65af\u52d2\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5904\u7406\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u4e14\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u963b\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u963b\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Existing task verification is treated as a passive, post-hoc process: a verifier (i.e., rule-based scoring script, reward or critic model, and LLM-as-a-Judge) analyzes the agent's entire interaction trajectory to determine if the agent succeeds. Such processing of verbose context that contains irrelevant, noisy history poses challenges to the verification protocols and therefore leads to prohibitive cost and low reliability. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SmartSnap, a paradigm shift from this passive, post-hoc verification to proactive, in-situ self-verification by the agent itself. We introduce the Self-Verifying Agent, a new type of agent designed with dual missions: to not only complete a task but also to prove its accomplishment with curated snapshot evidences. Guided by our proposed 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, and Creativity), the agent leverages its accessibility to the online environment to perform self-verification on a minimal, decisive set of snapshots. Such evidences are provided as the sole materials for a general LLM-as-a-Judge verifier to determine their validity and relevance. Experiments on mobile tasks across model families and scales demonstrate that our SmartSnap paradigm allows training LLM-driven agents in a scalable manner, bringing performance gains up to 26.08% and 16.66% respectively to 8B and 30B models.

Although scalar-field-based optimization provides a unified framework for multi-objective toolpath generation, maintaining boundary conformity while eliminating zero-gradient singularities that cause iso-curve branching or termination and disrupt toolpath continuity remains challenging on multiply connected surfaces. We propose an efficient strategy to robustly enforce these constraints throughout optimization. Conformal slit mapping is employed to construct a feasible, singularity-free initial scalar field. The optimization is reformulated as a topology-preserving mesh deformation governed by boundary-synchronous updates, enabling globally optimized spacing, scallop-height uniformity, and smooth trajectory transitions. Consequently, the toolpaths are continuous, boundary-conforming, and free of self-intersections. Milling experiments demonstrate that, compared with a state-of-the-art conformal slit mapping-based method, the proposed approach increases machining efficiency by 14.24%, improves scallop-height uniformity by 5.70%, and reduces milling impact-induced vibrations by over 10%.

The construction qulk-clause, a morphologically fused form meaning 'I said,' introduces embedded declarative interrogative, and imperative clauses, often eithout complementizer. The central proposal of this paper is that qulk-clauses are biclausal structures in which qulk functions a clause-embedding predicate sec;ecting a dull CP complement. By applying core minimalist operations, viz., Merge, Move, Agree, and Spell-out, the study provides a layered syntactic analysis of qulk-clauses, for illustrating how their derivation proceeds through standard computational steps and post-syntactic processes such as Morphological Merger. The proposal also accounts for dialect-specific features like bipartite negation, cliticization, and CP embedding.

Project website: https://uark-aicv.github.io/OBEYED_VLA", "summary": "Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made impressive progress toward general-purpose robotic manipulation by post-training large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for action prediction. Yet most VLAs entangle perception and control in a monolithic pipeline optimized purely for action, which can erode language-conditioned grounding. In our real-world tabletop tests, policies over-grasp when the target is absent, are distracted by clutter, and overfit to background appearance.\n  To address these issues, we propose OBEYED-VLA (OBject-centric and gEometrY groundED VLA), a framework that explicitly disentangles perceptual grounding from action reasoning. Instead of operating directly on raw RGB, OBEYED-VLA augments VLAs with a perception module that grounds multi-view inputs into task-conditioned, object-centric, and geometry-aware observations. This module includes a VLM-based object-centric grounding stage that selects task-relevant object regions across camera views, along with a complementary geometric grounding stage that emphasizes the 3D structure of these objects over their appearance. The resulting grounded views are then fed to a pretrained VLA policy, which we fine-tune exclusively on single-object demonstrations collected without environmental clutter or non-target objects.\n  On a real-world UR10e tabletop setup, OBEYED-VLA substantially improves robustness over strong VLA baselines across four challenging regimes and multiple difficulty levels: distractor objects, absent-target rejection, background appearance changes, and cluttered manipulation of unseen objects. Ablation studies confirm that both semantic grounding and geometry-aware grounding are critical to these gains. Overall, the results indicate that making perception an explicit, object-centric component is an effective way to strengthen and generalize VLA-based robotic manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "OBEYED-VLA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u8026\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u684c\u9762\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709VLA\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dVLA\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u8026\u5408\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u63a5\u5730\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6293\u53d6\u3001\u88ab\u6742\u7269\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62df\u5408\u80cc\u666f\u5916\u89c2\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOBEYED-VLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1) VLM\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63a5\u5730\u9636\u6bb5\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u5bf9\u8c61\u533a\u57df\uff1b2) \u51e0\u4f55\u63a5\u5730\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u8c03\u5bf9\u8c613D\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u975e\u5916\u89c2\u3002\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u63a5\u5730\u89c6\u56fe\u8f93\u5165\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VLA\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u65e0\u6742\u7269\u5355\u5bf9\u8c61\u6f14\u793a\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9eUR10e\u684c\u9762\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0cOBEYED-VLA\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5e72\u6270\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u7f3a\u5931\u62d2\u7edd\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u5916\u89c2\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u672a\u89c1\u5bf9\u8c61\u6742\u4e71\u64cd\u4f5c\uff09\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3aVLA\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u786e\u8ba4\u8bed\u4e49\u63a5\u5730\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u63a5\u5730\u90fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u3001\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u662f\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u6cdb\u5316VLA\u57fa\u7840\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u89e3\u8026\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

By incorporating random Fourier features into lightweight adapter modules, FAA decomposes intermediate representations into complementary low- and high-frequency components, enabling frequency-aware modulation of semantic information. This design allows the model to selectively emphasize informative frequency bands during adaptation while preserving the representational capacity of the frozen backbone. Extensive experiments on GLUE, E2E NLG, and instruction-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FAA consistently achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, while maintaining low computational and memory overhead.

To address this, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark called VLA-Arena. We propose a novel structured task design framework to quantify difficulty across three orthogonal axes: (1) Task Structure, (2) Language Command, and (3) Visual Observation. This allows us to systematically design tasks with fine-grained difficulty levels, enabling a precise measurement of model capability frontiers. For Task Structure, VLA-Arena's 170 tasks are grouped into four dimensions: Safety, Distractor, Extrapolation, and Long Horizon. Each task is designed with three difficulty levels (L0-L2), with fine-tuning performed exclusively on L0 to assess general capability. Orthogonal to this, language (W0-W4) and visual (V0-V4) perturbations can be applied to any task to enable a decoupled analysis of robustness. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art VLAs reveals several critical limitations, including a strong tendency toward memorization over generalization, asymmetric robustness, a lack of consideration for safety constraints, and an inability to compose learned skills for long-horizon tasks. To foster research addressing these challenges and ensure reproducibility, we provide the complete VLA-Arena framework, including an end-to-end toolchain from task definition to automated evaluation and the VLA-Arena-S/M/L datasets for fine-tuning.

Our method incorporates semantic reasoning via an LLM-generated knowledge prior that captures feature importance, inter-class confusability, and exemplar budget multipliers, and uses it to guide exemplar scoring and selection. These priors are combined with margin-based validation cues, PageRank centrality, hubness penalization, and facility-location optimization to obtain a compact and informative set of exemplars. Evaluated on the UCI-HAR dataset under strict few-shot conditions, the framework achieves a macro F1-score of 88.78%, outperforming classical approaches such as random sampling, herding, and $k$-center. The results show that LLM-derived semantic priors, when integrated with structural and geometric cues, provide a stronger foundation for selecting representative sensor exemplars in few-shot wearable-sensor HAR.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8303\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6307\u5bfc\u8303\u4f8b\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7eaf\u51e0\u4f55\u8303\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u76f8\u4f3c\u6d3b\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u884c\u8d70\u3001\u4e0a\u697c\u68af\u3001\u4e0b\u697c\u68af\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3001\u7c7b\u95f4\u6df7\u6dc6\u5ea6\u3001\u8303\u4f8b\u9884\u7b97\u4e58\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ebf\u7d22\u3001PageRank\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u3001\u67a2\u7ebd\u60e9\u7f5a\u548c\u8bbe\u65bd\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8303\u4f8b\u96c6", "result": "\u5728UCI-HAR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fbe\u523088.78%\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9\u548ck-center\u7b49\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "LLM\u884d\u751f\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8303\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u57fa\u7840"}}

To address these challenges, we propose a parallel mapping and motion planning framework that tightly integrates Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT)-based environment representation with a sampling-based model predictive control (SMPC) planner. On the mapping side, a dense distance-field-based representation is constructed using a GPU-based EDT and augmented with a robot-masked update mechanism to prevent false self-collision detections during online perception. On the planning side, motion generation is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem with a unified objective function and efficiently solved by evaluating large batches of candidate rollouts in parallel within a SMPC framework, in which a geometrically consistent pose tracking metric defined on SE(3) is incorporated to ensure fast and accurate convergence to the target pose. The entire mapping and planning pipeline is implemented on the GPU to support high-frequency replanning.

To address this, we integrate the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM), a lightweight classification-based framework that operates independently of LLM-based judgments, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining high detection accuracy. We conduct a comparative analysis of hallucination detection methods across various LLMs, evaluating True Positive Rate (TPR), True Negative Rate (TNR), and Accuracy on question-answering (QA) and summarization tasks. Our results show that HHEM reduces evaluation time from 8 hours to 10 minutes, while HHEM with non-fabrication checking achieves the highest accuracy \\(82.2\\%\\) and TPR \\(78.9\\%\\). However, HHEM struggles with localized hallucinations in summarization tasks. To address this, we introduce segment-based retrieval, improving detection by verifying smaller text components. Additionally, our cumulative distribution function (CDF) analysis indicates that larger models (7B-9B parameters) generally exhibit fewer hallucinations, while intermediate-sized models show higher instability. These findings highlight the need for structured evaluation frameworks that balance computational efficiency with robust factual validation, enhancing the reliability of LLM-generated content.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6HHEM\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u4ece8\u5c0f\u65f6\u964d\u81f310\u5206\u949f\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0882.2%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982KnowHalu\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408Hughes\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff08HHEM\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56LLM\u5224\u65ad\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7d2f\u79ef\u5206\u5e03\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u6790\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "HHEM\u5c06\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece8\u5c0f\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u523010\u5206\u949f\uff0cHHEM\u914d\u5408\u975e\u634f\u9020\u68c0\u67e5\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u738782.2%\u548c\u771f\u9633\u6027\u738778.9%\u3002\u5206\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002CDF\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u8f83\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff087B-9B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u5e7b\u89c9\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u4e2d\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002HHEM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u5e7b\u89c9\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

A practical solution for continuous operation is to power the drone from the ground via a tether. While this approach has been demonstrated for stationary systems, scenarios with a fast-moving base vehicle or strong wind conditions require modeling the tether forces, including aerodynamic effects. In this work, we propose two complementary approaches for real-time quasi-static tether modeling with aerodynamics. The first is an analytical method based on catenary theory with a uniform drag assumption, achieving very fast solve times below 1ms. The second is a numerical method that discretizes the tether into segments and lumped masses, solving the equilibrium equations using CasADi and IPOPT. By leveraging initialization strategies, such as warm starting and analytical initialization, real-time performance was achieved with a solve time of 5ms, while allowing for flexible force formulations. Both approaches were validated in real-world tests using a load cell to measure the tether force. The results show that the analytical method provides sufficient accuracy for most tethered UAV applications with minimal computational cost, while the numerical method offers higher flexibility and physical accuracy when required. These approaches form a lightweight and extensible framework for real-time tether simulation, applicable to both offline optimization and online tasks such as simulation, control, and trajectory planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u7cfb\u7559\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u60ac\u94fe\u7ebf\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u6cd5\uff08<1ms\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6cd5\uff085ms\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u79fb\u52a8\u57fa\u5ea7\u6216\u5f3a\u98ce\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7cfb\u7559\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u65cb\u7ffc\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u53d7\u7535\u6c60\u9650\u5236\u98de\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u77ed\uff0c\u5730\u9762\u4f9b\u7535\u662f\u8fde\u7eed\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u4f46\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u79fb\u52a8\u57fa\u5ea7\u6216\u5f3a\u98ce\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u7cfb\u7559\u7ef3\u7684\u529b\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7a7a\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6548\u5e94\uff09\u3002", "method": "1. \u89e3\u6790\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u60ac\u94fe\u7ebf\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u5747\u5300\u963b\u529b\uff0c\u6c42\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4<1ms\uff1b2. \u6570\u503c\u6cd5\uff1a\u5c06\u7cfb\u7559\u7ef3\u79bb\u6563\u4e3a\u5206\u6bb5\u548c\u96c6\u4e2d\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528CasADi\u548cIPOPT\u6c42\u89e3\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff09\u5b9e\u73b05ms\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u89e3\u6790\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7cfb\u7559\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u8db3\u591f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6700\u4f4e\uff1b\u6570\u503c\u6cd5\u5728\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u7cfb\u7559\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\uff09\u3002"}}

Performing this task properly is fundamental for the execution of several activities, for instance, cleaning a facility with a robotic vacuum cleaner. In the mining industry, it is required to perform coverage in several unit processes related with material movement using industrial machinery, for example, in cleaning tasks, in dumps, and in the construction of tailings dam walls. The automation of these processes is fundamental to enhance the security associated with their execution. In this work, a coverage navigation system for a non-holonomic robot is presented. This work is intended to be a proof of concept for the potential automation of various unit processes that require coverage navigation like the ones mentioned before. The developed system includes the calculation of routes that allow a mobile platform to cover a specific area, and incorporates recovery behaviors in case that an unforeseen event occurs, such as the arising of dynamic or previously unmapped obstacles in the terrain to be covered, e.g., other machines or pedestrians passing through the area, being able to perform evasive maneuvers and post-recovery to ensure a complete coverage of the terrain. The system was tested in different simulated and real outdoor environments, obtaining results near 90% of coverage in the majority of experiments. The next step of development is to scale up the utilized robot to a mining machine/vehicle whose operation will be validated in a real environment.

Integrating LLMs with professional fields and redefining the relationship between LLMs and domain-specific applications has become a critical challenge for promoting enterprise digital transformation and broader social development. To effectively integrate LLMs into the accounting domain, it is essential to understand their domain-specific reasoning capabilities. This study introduces the concept of vertical-domain accounting reasoning and establishes evaluation criteria by analyzing the training data characteristics of representative GLM-series models. These criteria provide a foundation for subsequent research on reasoning paradigms and offer benchmarks for improving accounting reasoning performance. Based on this framework, we evaluate several representative models, including GLM-6B, GLM-130B, GLM-4, and OpenAI GPT-4, on a set of accounting reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that different prompt engineering strategies lead to varying degrees of performance improvement across models, with GPT-4 achieving the strongest accounting reasoning capability. However, current LLMs still fall short of real-world application requirements. In particular, further optimization is needed for deployment in enterprise-level accounting scenarios to fully realize the potential value of LLMs in this domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u4f1a\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4f1a\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0GPT-4\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u5728\u5404\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u5230\u4f1a\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3LLMs\u5728\u4f1a\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f01\u4e1a\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u53d1\u5c55", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u4f1a\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790GLM\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u5efa\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30GLM-6B\u3001GLM-130B\u3001GLM-4\u548cGPT-4\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f1a\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6548\u679c", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0cGPT-4\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u4f1a\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4f46\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u4ecd\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u4f1a\u8ba1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u4f1a\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u4e13\u95e8\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u4f1a\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u624d\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325LLMs\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4ef7\u503c"}}

Although Korean words are morphologically complex, treating morphemes as constituency terminals conflates word internal morphology with phrase level syntactic structure and creates mismatches with eojeol based dependency resources. This paper argues for an eojeol based constituency representation, with morphological segmentation and fine grained part of speech information encoded in a separate, non constituent layer. A comparative analysis shows that, under explicit normalization assumptions, the Sejong and Penn Korean treebanks can be treated as representationally equivalent at the eojeol based constituency level. Building on this result, we outline an eojeol based annotation scheme that preserves interpretable constituency and supports cross treebank comparison and constituency dependency conversion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u97e9\u8bed\u9009\u533a\u6811\u5e93\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\"\uc5b4\uc808\"\uff08eojeol\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u672c\u5355\u4f4d\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8bcd\u7d20\uff0c\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u8bcd\u5185\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u77ed\u8bed\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f9d\u5b58\u8d44\u6e90\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u97e9\u8bed\u9009\u533a\u6811\u5e93\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9762\u4e34\u57fa\u672c\u8868\u793a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u9009\u62e9\u8bcd\u7d20\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ec8\u7aef\u5355\u4f4d\u4f1a\u6df7\u6dc6\u8bcd\u5185\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u77ed\u8bed\u7ea7\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\uc5b4\uc808\u7684\u4f9d\u5b58\u8d44\u6e90\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\uc5b4\uc808\u7684\u9009\u533a\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u5f62\u6001\u5207\u5206\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bcd\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u975e\u6210\u5206\u5c42\u4e2d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u660e\u786e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e16\u5b97\u548c\u5bbe\u5927\u97e9\u8bed\u6811\u5e93\u5728\uc5b4\uc808\u9009\u533a\u5c42\u9762\u5177\u6709\u8868\u793a\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\uc5b4\uc808\u7684\u9009\u533a\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9009\u533a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u6811\u5e93\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u9009\u533a-\u4f9d\u5b58\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "conclusion": "\u97e9\u8bed\u9009\u533a\u6811\u5e93\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\uc5b4\uc808\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u672c\u5355\u4f4d\uff0c\u5c06\u5f62\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u79bb\u5230\u72ec\u7acb\u5c42\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u97e9\u8bed\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u8d44\u6e90\u4fdd\u6301\u517c\u5bb9\u3002"}}

While the general n-robot landscape has been largely established, the exact structure for two robots has remained unresolved. This paper presents the first complete characterization of the computational power of two autonomous robots across all major models, namely OBLOT, FSTA, FCOM, and LUMI, under the full spectrum of schedulers (FSYNCH, SSYNCH, ASYNCH, and their atomic variants). Our results reveal a landscape that fundamentally differs from the general case. Most notably, we prove that FSTA^F and LUMI^F coincide under full synchrony, a surprising collapse indicating that perfect synchrony can substitute both memory and communication when only two robots exist. We also show that FSTA and FCOM are orthogonal: there exists a problem solvable in the weakest communication model but impossible even in the strongest finite-state model, completing the bidirectional incomparability. All equivalence and separation results are derived through a novel simulation-free method, providing a unified and constructive view of the two-robot hierarchy. This yields the first complete and exact computational landscape for two robots, highlighting the intrinsic challenges of coordination at the minimal scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5b8c\u6574\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u81ea\u4e3b\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e3b\u8981\u6a21\u578b\uff08OBLOT\u3001FSTA\u3001FCOM\u3001LUMI\uff09\u53ca\u6240\u6709\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u60c5\u51b5\u6839\u672c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u683c\u5c40\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4ebaLCM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u5df2\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u76f4\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6700\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u5185\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e3b\u8981\u6a21\u578b\uff08OBLOT\u3001FSTA\u3001FCOM\u3001LUMI\uff09\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff08FSYNCH\u3001SSYNCH\u3001ASYNCH\u53ca\u5176\u539f\u5b50\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "1. \u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u540c\u6b65\u4e0bFSTA^F\u548cLUMI^F\u91cd\u5408\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u540c\u6b65\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\uff1b2. \u8bc1\u660eFSTA\u548cFCOM\u6b63\u4ea4\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5f31\u901a\u4fe1\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u4f46\u5f3a\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b3. \u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u4e0d\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u683c\u5c40\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\u6839\u672c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

This paper proposes ManchuTTS(Manchu Text to Speech), a novel approach tailored to Manchu's linguistic characteristics. To handle agglutination, this method designs a three-tier text representation (phoneme, syllable, prosodic) and a cross-modal hierarchical attention mechanism for multi-granular alignment. The synthesis model integrates deep convolutional networks with a flow-matching Transformer, enabling efficient, non-autoregressive generation. This method further introduce a hierarchical contrastive loss to guide structured acoustic-linguistic correspondence. To address low-resource constraints, This method construct the first Manchu TTS dataset and employ a data augmentation strategy. Experiments demonstrate that ManchuTTS attains a MOS of 4.52 using a 5.2-hour training subset derived from our full 6.24-hour annotated corpus, outperforming all baseline models by a notable margin.

Similarly, we demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can learn to dynamically determine when to attend to global context. We propose All-or-Here Attention (AHA), which utilizes a binary router per attention head to dynamically toggle between full attention and local sliding window attention for each token. Our results indicate that with a window size of 256 tokens, up to 93\\% of the original full attention operations can be replaced by sliding window attention without performance loss. Furthermore, by evaluating AHA across various window sizes, we identify a long-tail distribution in context dependency, where the necessity for full attention decays rapidly as the local window expands. By decoupling local processing from global access, AHA reveals that full attention is largely redundant, and that efficient inference requires only on-demand access to the global context.", "AI": {"tldr": "AHA\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8ba9LLM\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u5143\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u95f4\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u53ef\u51cf\u5c1193%\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb\u4e60\u60ef\u542f\u53d1\u2014\u2014\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u5f53\u524d\u9875\uff0c\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u624d\u56de\u987e\u524d\u6587\u3002\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5bf9\u6240\u6709token\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAll-or-Here Attention (AHA)\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u914d\u5907\u4e8c\u5143\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u9009\u62e9\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6216\u5c40\u90e8\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3a256\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u66ff\u636293%\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u64cd\u4f5c\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u5448\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5c40\u90e8\u7a97\u53e3\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b8c\u6574\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u8fc5\u901f\u8870\u51cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b8c\u6574\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u662f\u5197\u4f59\u7684\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u6309\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002AHA\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u5c40\u90e8\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

To tackle these challenging issues, this work proposes P-FABRIK, a general, intuitive, and robust inverse kinematics method to find one feasible solution for diverse parallel mechanisms based on the FABRIK algorithm. By decomposing the general parallel mechanism into multiple serial sub-chains using a new topological decomposition strategy, the end targets of each sub-chain can be subsequently revised to calculate the inverse kinematics solutions iteratively.

Therefore, achieving precise and robust motion control is a challenging yet important objective. Here, we propose a novel prescribed performance motion control framework based on variable-gain extended state observers (ESOs), referred to as PreGME. The method includes variable-gain ESOs for real-time estimation of dynamic coupling and a prescribed performance flight control that incorporates error trajectory constraints. Compared with existing methods, the proposed approach exhibits the following two characteristics. First, the adopted variable-gain ESOs can accurately estimate rapidly varying dynamic coupling. This enables the proposed method to handle manipulation tasks that require aggressive motion of the robotic arm. Second, by prescribing the performance, a preset error trajectory is generated to guide the system evolution along this trajectory. This strategy allows the proposed method to ensure the tracking error remains within the prescribed performance envelope, thereby achieving high-precision control. Experiments on a real platform, including aerial staff twirling, aerial mixology, and aerial cart-pulling experiments, are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that even under the dynamic coupling caused by rapid robotic arm motion (end-effector velocity: 1.02 m/s, acceleration: 5.10 m/s$^2$), the proposed method achieves high tracking performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u589e\u76ca\u6269\u5c55\u72b6\u6001\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u89c4\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6PreGME\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u7a7a\u4e2d\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u52a8\u6001\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9c81\u68d2\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a7a\u4e2d\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\uff08\u591a\u65cb\u7ffc\u57fa\u5ea7+\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8026\u5408\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4f46\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPreGME\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u53d8\u589e\u76ca\u6269\u5c55\u72b6\u6001\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u8026\u5408\uff1b2) \u89c4\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u98de\u884c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8bef\u5dee\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cbf\u9884\u8bbe\u8f68\u8ff9\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7a7a\u4e2d\u68cd\u68d2\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8c03\u9152\u548c\u7a7a\u4e2d\u62c9\u8f66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\uff08\u672b\u7aef\u901f\u5ea61.02 m/s\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u5ea65.10 m/s\u00b2\uff09\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684PreGME\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u5267\u70c8\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bef\u5dee\u5728\u9884\u8bbe\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

However, existing LLM-based approaches largely adopt general natural language processing techniques and are prone to reasoning errors when handling complex numerical sequences. Different from purely textual tasks, time series data are inherently verifiable, enabling consistency checking between reasoning steps and the original input. Motivated by this property, we propose T3LLM, which performs multi-step reasoning with an explicit correction mechanism for time series question answering. The T3LLM framework consists of three LLMs, namely, a worker, a reviewer, and a student, that are responsible for generation, review, and reasoning learning, respectively. Within this framework, the worker generates step-wise chains of thought (CoT) under structured prompts, while the reviewer inspects the reasoning, identifies erroneous steps, and provides corrective comments. The collaboratively generated corrected CoT are used to fine-tune the student model, internalizing multi-step reasoning and self-correction into its parameters. Experiments on multiple real-world TSQA benchmarks demonstrate that T3LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance over strong LLM-based baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "T3LLM\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09LLM\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u4f5c-\u8bc4\u5ba1-\u5b66\u751f\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea0\u9519\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aTSQA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6570\u503c\u5e8f\u5217\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u800c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faT3LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2aLLM\uff1a\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\uff08\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff09\u3001\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8005\uff08\u68c0\u67e5\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u6b65\u9aa4\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ea0\u6b63\u610f\u89c1\uff09\u3001\u5b66\u751f\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea0\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5185\u5316\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u7ea0\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cTSQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cT3LLM\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684LLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "T3LLM\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea0\u9519\u673a\u5236\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

At the low level, we propose a training-paradigm-oriented taxonomy for learning-based control, organizing existing methods along input modeling, latent representation learning, and policy learning.

We introduce M2G-Eval, a multi-granularity, multilingual framework for evaluating code generation in large language models (LLMs) across four levels: Class, Function, Block, and Line. Spanning 18 programming languages, M2G-Eval includes 17K+ training tasks and 1,286 human-annotated, contamination-controlled test instances. We develop M2G-Eval-Coder models by training Qwen3-8B with supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. Evaluating 30 models (28 state-of-the-art LLMs plus our two M2G-Eval-Coder variants) reveals three main findings: (1) an apparent difficulty hierarchy, with Line-level tasks easiest and Class-level most challenging; (2) widening performance gaps between full- and partial-granularity languages as task complexity increases; and (3) strong cross-language correlations, suggesting that models learn transferable programming concepts. M2G-Eval enables fine-grained diagnosis of code generation capabilities and highlights persistent challenges in synthesizing complex, long-form code.", "AI": {"tldr": "M2G-Eval\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\uff08\u7c7b\u3001\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u5757\u3001\u884c\uff09\u548c18\u79cd\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u5927\u591a\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e00\u7ed3\u6784\u7c92\u5ea6\u548c\u6709\u9650\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u7801\u7c92\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1M2G-Eval\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b17K+\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u548c1,286\u4e2a\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u6c61\u67d3\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d618\u79cd\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u56db\u4e2a\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548cGroup Relative Policy Optimization\u8bad\u7ec3Qwen3-8B\u6a21\u578b\u5f97\u5230M2G-Eval-Coder\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f3030\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0828\u4e2aSOTA LLM + 2\u4e2aM2G-Eval-Coder\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a(1) \u660e\u663e\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u5c42\u6b21\uff1a\u884c\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u6700\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u7c7b\u7ea7\u6700\u56f0\u96be\uff1b(2) \u968f\u7740\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5b8c\u6574\u7c92\u5ea6\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u6269\u5927\uff1b(3) \u5f3a\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e86\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "conclusion": "M2G-Eval\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u5e76\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u590d\u6742\u3001\u957f\u7bc7\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While humans can describe movement goals explicitly such as \"walking forward with an upright posture,\" the underlying control strategies that realize these goals are largely implicit, making it difficult to directly design rewards from high-level goals and natural language descriptions. We introduce Motion from Vision-Language Representation (MoVLR), a framework that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to bridge the gap between goal specification and movement control. Rather than relying on handcrafted rewards, MoVLR iteratively explores the reward space through iterative interaction between control optimization and VLM feedback, aligning control policies with physically coordinated behaviors. Our approach transforms language and vision-based assessments into structured guidance for embodied learning, enabling the discovery and refinement of reward functions for high-dimensional musculoskeletal locomotion and manipulation. These results suggest that VLMs can effectively ground abstract motion descriptions in the implicit principles governing physiological motor control.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoVLR\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u4e0eVLM\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abc\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fd0\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\"\u4ee5\u76f4\u7acb\u59ff\u52bf\u5411\u524d\u884c\u8d70\"\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u5927\u591a\u662f\u9690\u5f0f\u7684\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u9ad8\u7ea7\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMotion from Vision-Language Representation (MoVLR)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u89c4\u8303\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u6865\u6881\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u4e0eVLM\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u5956\u52b1\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u534f\u8c03\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "MoVLR\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u9ad8\u7ef4\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u8fd0\u52a8\u63cf\u8ff0\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u7406\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this paper, we revisit diffusion language modeling from the view of diffusion process and language modeling, and outline five properties that separate diffusion mechanics from language-specific requirements. We first categorize existing approaches into continuous diffusion in embedding space and discrete diffusion over tokens. We then show that each satisfies only part of the five essential properties and therefore reflects a structural trade-off. Through analyses of recent large diffusion language models, we identify two central issues: (i) uniform corruption does not respect how information is distributed across positions, and (ii) token-wise marginal training cannot capture multi-token dependencies during parallel decoding. These observations motivate diffusion processes that align more closely with the structure of text, and encourage future work toward more coherent diffusion language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u7b49\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u6587\u672c\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u6269\u6563\u539f\u7406\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u7c7b\uff1a\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6269\u6563\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0a\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u5927\u578b\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5747\u5300\u7834\u574f\u4e0d\u5c0a\u91cd\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u8fb9\u9645\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6807\u8bb0\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u80fd\u90e8\u5206\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5747\u5300\u7834\u574f\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6807\u8bb0\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u6587\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e94\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u6587\u672c\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

While Blender is a powerful and freely available 3D graphics platform, its steep learning curve and lack of robotics-focused integrations make it difficult and time-consuming for researchers to use effectively. In this work, we introduce a lightweight software library that bridges this gap by providing simple scripting interfaces for common robotics visualization tasks. The library offers three primary capabilities: (1) importing robots and environments directly from standardized descriptions such as URDF; (2) Python-based scripting tools for keyframing robot states and visual attributes; and (3) convenient generation of primitive 3D shapes for schematic figures and animations. Together, these features allow robotics researchers to rapidly create publication-ready images, animations, and explanatory schematics without needing extensive Blender expertise.

However, recent studies show that CoT explanations often fail to reflect the model's actual reasoning process, as models may produce coherent yet misleading justifications or modify answers without acknowledging external cues. Such discrepancies undermine the reliability of CoT-based methods for safety supervision and alignment monitoring, as models can generate plausible but deceptive rationales for incorrect answers. To better understand this limitation, we evaluate two optimization methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), in their ability to improve CoT faithfulness. Our experiments show that GRPO achieves higher performance than DPO in larger models, with the Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model attaining the best results across all evaluation metrics. Both approaches exhibit positive correlations between model size and performance, but GRPO shows greater potential for improving faithfulness metrics, albeit with less stable behavior at smaller scales.

In this work, we introduce the Universal Robot Description Directory (URDD), a modular representation that organizes derived robot information into structured, easy-to-parse JSON and YAML modules. Our open-source toolkit automatically generates URDDs from URDFs, with a Rust implementation supporting Bevy-based visualization. Additionally, we provide a JavaScript/Three.js viewer for web-based inspection of URDDs. Experiments on multiple robot platforms show that URDDs can be generated efficiently, encapsulate substantially richer information than standard specification files, and directly enable the construction of core robotics subroutines.

Code available at https://github.com/peremartra/llama-glu-expansion-pruning", "summary": "Structured width pruning of GLU-MLP layers, guided by the Maximum Absolute Weight (MAW) criterion, reveals a systematic dichotomy in how reducing the expansion ratio affects different model capabilities. While performance on tasks relying on parametric knowledge (e.g., MMLU, GSM8K) and perplexity metrics degrades predictably, instruction-following capabilities improve substantially (+46% to +75% in IFEval for Llama-3.2-1B and 3B models), and multi-step reasoning remains robust (MUSR). This pattern challenges the prevailing assumption that pruning induces uniform degradation. We evaluated seven expansion ratio configurations using comprehensive benchmarks assessing factual knowledge, mathematical reasoning, language comprehension, instruction-following, and truthfulness. Our analysis identifies the expansion ratio as a critical architectural parameter that selectively modulates cognitive capabilities, rather than merely serving as a compression metric. We provide the first systematic characterization of this selective preservation phenomenon. Notably, we document a robust inverse correlation (r = -0.864, p = 0.012 in Llama-3B) between factual knowledge capacity (MMLU) and truthfulness metrics (TruthfulQA-MC2): as knowledge degrades, the model's ability to discriminate misconceptions improves consistently. This connects two previously distinct research areas, demonstrating that MAW-guided width pruning acts as a selective filter, reducing parametric knowledge while preserving or enhancing behavioral alignment. Additionally, we quantify context-dependent efficiency trade-offs: pruned configurations achieve up to 23% reduction in energy consumption (J/token) but incur penalties in single-request latency, whereas batch processing workloads benefit uniformly.", "AI": {"tldr": "GLU-MLP\u5c42\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5bbd\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4e8c\u5206\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u51cf\u5c11\u6269\u5c55\u6bd4\u7387\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u4f46\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u526a\u679d\u5bfc\u81f4\u5747\u5300\u9000\u5316\u7684\u666e\u904d\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76GLU-MLP\u5c42\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5bbd\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u526a\u679d\u5bfc\u81f4\u5747\u5300\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u6269\u5c55\u6bd4\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8c03\u8282\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u67b6\u6784\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u7edd\u5bf9\u6743\u91cd\u51c6\u5219\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5bbd\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728Llama-3.2-1B\u548c3B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e03\u79cd\u6269\u5c55\u6bd4\u7387\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7b49\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4fdd\u5b58\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\uff08IFEval\u63d0\u9ad846%-75%\uff09\uff0c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u3002\u9996\u6b21\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff08r=-0.864\uff09\uff0c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0b\u964d\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u8fa8\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u53cd\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u526a\u679d\u914d\u7f6e\u53ef\u51cf\u5c1123%\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u8bf7\u6c42\u5ef6\u8fdf\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u5c55\u6bd4\u7387\u662f\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8c03\u8282\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u67b6\u6784\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u538b\u7f29\u6307\u6807\u3002MAW\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5bbd\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\u5145\u5f53\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u589e\u5f3a\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u526a\u679d\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e24\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

These checks are typically performed between pairs of shapes attached to different robot links. However, many of these shape pairs can be excluded in advance, as their configurations are known to always or never result in contact. This information is typically encoded in a self-collision matrix, where each entry (i, j) indicates whether a check should be performed between shape i and shape j. While the MoveIt Setup Assistant is widely used to generate such matrices, current tools are limited by static visualization, lack of proximity support, rigid single-geometry assumptions, and tedious refinement workflows, hindering flexibility and reuse in downstream robotics applications. In this work, we introduce an interactive tool that overcomes these limitations by generating and visualizing self-collision matrices across multiple shape representations, enabling dynamic inspection, filtering, and refinement of shape pairs. Outputs are provided in both JSON and YAML for easy integration. The system is implemented in Rust and uses the Bevy game engine to deliver high-quality visualizations. We demonstrate its effectiveness on multiple robot platforms, showing that matrices generated using diverse shape types yield faster and more accurate self-collision and self-proximity queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u78b0\u649e\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u5f62\u72b6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u78b0\u649e\u548c\u81ea\u63a5\u8fd1\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u5982MoveIt Setup Assistant\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u9759\u6001\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63a5\u8fd1\u5ea6\u652f\u6301\u3001\u521a\u6027\u5355\u51e0\u4f55\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u7e41\u7410\u4f18\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u7b49\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eRust\u548cBevy\u6e38\u620f\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u751f\u6210\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u81ea\u78b0\u649e\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u53ef\u52a8\u6001\u68c0\u67e5\u3001\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5f62\u72b6\u5bf9\uff0c\u8f93\u51faJSON\u548cYAML\u683c\u5f0f\u4ee5\u4fbf\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5f62\u72b6\u7c7b\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u81ea\u78b0\u649e\u548c\u81ea\u63a5\u8fd1\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5de5\u5177\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u5f62\u72b6\u8868\u793a\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u78b0\u649e\u77e9\u9635\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Our central contribution is the identification of a coverage-efficiency tradeoff: while naive conformal prediction achieves valid coverage, it produces prediction sets of hundreds of tokens, rendering them uninformative. We propose Vocabulary-Aware Conformal Prediction (VACP), a framework that leverages semantic masking and temperature-adjusted scoring to reduce the effective prediction space while provably maintaining marginal coverage. Experiments on Gemma-2B using SQUAD and WikiText benchmarks demonstrate that VACP achieves 89.7 percent empirical coverage (90 percent target) while reducing the mean prediction set size from 847 tokens to 4.3 tokens -- a 197x improvement in efficiency.

This paper shifts the focus from descriptor design to a systematic investigation of descriptor robustness. Our primary contribution is the establishment of a specialized evaluation framework centered on the Small Pole Landmark (SPL) dataset. This dataset is constructed via an automated tracking-based association pipeline that captures multi-view, multi-distance observations of the same physical landmarks without manual annotation. Using this framework, we present a comparative analysis of Contrastive Learning (CL) and Supervised Learning (SL) paradigms. Our findings reveal that CL induces a more robust feature space for sparse geometry, achieving superior retrieval performance particularly in the 5--10m range.

Current studies are largely focused on English, which has resulted in a lack of resources for low-resource languages such as Urdu. As a result, the creation of tools that facilitate positive online communication remains limited. Although transformer-based architectures have proven to be effective in detecting hate and offensive speech, little has been done to apply them to hope speech or, more generally, to test them across a variety of linguistic settings. This paper presents a multilingual framework for hope speech detection with a focus on Urdu. Using pretrained transformer models such as XLM-RoBERTa, mBERT, EuroBERT, and UrduBERT, we apply simple preprocessing and train classifiers for improved results. Evaluations on the PolyHope-M 2025 benchmark demonstrate strong performance, achieving F1-scores of 95.2% for Urdu binary classification and 65.2% for Urdu multi-class classification, with similarly competitive results in Spanish, German, and English. These results highlight the possibility of implementing existing multilingual models in low-resource environments, thus making it easier to identify hope speech and helping to build a more constructive digital discourse.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5e0c\u671b\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u9488\u5bf9\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e0c\u671b\u8a00\u8bba\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u76f8\u5bf9\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u7b49\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f8\u5173\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u867d\u7136Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4ec7\u6068\u548c\u5192\u72af\u6027\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5f88\u5c11\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5e0c\u671b\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e5f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff08XLM-RoBERTa\u3001mBERT\u3001EuroBERT\u3001UrduBERT\uff09\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002\u5728PolyHope-M 2025\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u548c\u591a\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728PolyHope-M 2025\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u8868\u73b0\uff1a\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7bF1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe95.2%\uff0c\u591a\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u8fbe65.2%\u3002\u5728\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u3001\u5fb7\u8bed\u548c\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u4e5f\u83b7\u5f97\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u65bd\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u5e0c\u671b\u8a00\u8bba\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5177\u5efa\u8bbe\u6027\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u8bdd\u8bed\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

Our study explores the potential for a mobile manipulator to support these operations, emphasizing the need for autonomous functionality to minimize crew and ground operator effort while enabling real-time task execution. We focused on the robot's transportation capabilities, simulating its motion planning in 3D space. The actual motion execution was tested with a prototype on a 2D table to mimic a microgravity environment.

We introduce a human-validated framework to evaluate whether model-generated reasoning traces logically support their conclusions across languages. Analyzing 65k reasoning traces from GlobalMMLU questions across 6 languages and 6 frontier models, we uncover a critical blind spot: while models achieve high task accuracy, their reasoning can fail to support their conclusions. Reasoning traces in non-Latin scripts show at least twice as much misalignment between their reasoning and conclusions than those in Latin scripts. We develop an error taxonomy through human annotation to characterize these failures, finding they stem primarily from evidential errors (unsupported claims, ambiguous facts) followed by illogical reasoning steps.

Coupling mechanisms for heterogeneous structural modules should meet all of the following requirements: single-sided coupling and decoupling, flat surfaces when uncoupled, and coupling to passive coupling interfaces as well as coupling behavior between coupling mechanisms. The design requirements for such a coupling mechanism are complex. We propose a novel shape-matching mechanical coupling mechanism that satisfies these design requirements. This mechanism enables controlled, sequential transitions between male and female states. When uncoupled, all mechanisms are in the female state. To enable single-sided coupling, one side of the mechanisms switches to the male state during the coupling process. Single-sided decoupling is possible not only from the male side but also from the female side by forcibly switching the opposite mechanism's male state to the female state. This coupling mechanism can be applied to various modular robot systems and robot arm tool changers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u673a\u68b0\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5355\u4fa7\u8fde\u63a5/\u65ad\u5f00\u3001\u5e73\u9762\u8868\u9762\u3001\u4e0e\u88ab\u52a8\u63a5\u53e3\u517c\u5bb9\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u5de5\u5177\u66f4\u6362\u5668", "motivation": "\u6676\u683c\u578b\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5982\u592a\u7a7a\uff09\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u6ee1\u8db3\u590d\u6742\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5355\u4fa7\u8fde\u63a5/\u65ad\u5f00\u3001\u672a\u8fde\u63a5\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5e73\u9762\u8868\u9762\u3001\u80fd\u4e0e\u88ab\u52a8\u8026\u5408\u63a5\u53e3\u8fde\u63a5\u3001\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u80fd\u76f8\u4e92\u8fde\u63a5", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u673a\u68b0\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u5728\u7537\u6027\u548c\u5973\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u5207\u6362\u3002\u672a\u8fde\u63a5\u65f6\u6240\u6709\u673a\u5236\u5904\u4e8e\u5973\u6027\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e00\u4fa7\u5207\u6362\u5230\u7537\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u4fa7\u8fde\u63a5\u3002\u5355\u4fa7\u65ad\u5f00\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u7537\u6027\u4fa7\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u5c06\u5bf9\u65b9\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7537\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u5207\u6362\u4e3a\u5973\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u4ece\u5973\u6027\u4fa7\u5b9e\u73b0", "result": "\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u6210\u529f\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8981\u6c42\uff1a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u4fa7\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u65ad\u5f00\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u672a\u8fde\u63a5\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5e73\u9762\u8868\u9762\uff0c\u80fd\u4e0e\u88ab\u52a8\u8026\u5408\u63a5\u53e3\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u4e14\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u80fd\u76f8\u4e92\u8fde\u63a5", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u673a\u68b0\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u8026\u5408\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u53ef\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u5de5\u5177\u66f4\u6362\u5668"}}

However, responses to socially sensitive questions frequently exhibit Social Desirability Bias (SDB), diverging from real human data toward socially acceptable answers. Existing studies on social desirability bias in LLM-based sampling remain limited. In this work, we investigate whether minimal, psychologically grounded prompt wording can mitigate this bias and improve alignment between silicon and human samples. We conducted a study using data from the American National Election Study (ANES) on three LLMs from two model families: the open-source Llama-3.1 series and GPT-4.1-mini. We first replicate a baseline silicon sampling study, confirming the persistent Social Desirability Bias. We then test four prompt-based mitigation methods: \\emph{reformulated} (neutral, third-person phrasing), \\emph{reverse-coded} (semantic inversion), and two meta-instructions, \\emph{priming} and \\emph{preamble}, respectively encouraging analytics and sincerity. Alignment with ANES is evaluated using Jensen-Shannon Divergence with bootstrap confidence intervals. Our results demonstrate that reformulated prompts most effectively improve alignment by reducing distribution concentration on socially acceptable answers and achieving distributions closer to ANES. Reverse-coding produced mixed results across eligible items, while the Priming and Preamble encouraged response uniformity and showed no systematic benefit for bias mitigation. Our findings validate the efficacy of prompt-based framing controls in mitigating inherent Social Desirability Bias in LLMs, providing a practical path toward more representative silicon samples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11LLM\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u53e3\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u671f\u671b\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f7f\u7845\u6837\u672c\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u53e3\u54cd\u5e94\uff08\u7845\u91c7\u6837\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u654f\u611f\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u793e\u4f1a\u671f\u671b\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6b64\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7f8e\u56fd\u56fd\u5bb6\u9009\u4e3e\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728Llama-3.1\u548cGPT-4.1-mini\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56db\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\uff08\u4e2d\u6027\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\uff09\u3001\u53cd\u5411\u7f16\u7801\uff08\u8bed\u4e49\u53cd\u8f6c\uff09\u3001\u542f\u52a8\uff08\u9f13\u52b1\u5206\u6790\u6027\uff09\u548c\u5e8f\u8a00\uff08\u9f13\u52b1\u771f\u8bda\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Jensen-Shannon\u6563\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0eANES\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u6700\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u3002\u53cd\u5411\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u7b26\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\uff0c\u542f\u52a8\u548c\u5e8f\u8a00\u65b9\u6cd5\u9f13\u52b1\u4e86\u56de\u7b54\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u504f\u5dee\u7f13\u89e3\u6ca1\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u76ca\u5904\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3LLM\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u671f\u671b\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3a\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5177\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7845\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

While large scale vision language action (VLA) models have shown impressive generalization in household and industrial manipulation by leveraging paired video action data from diverse domains, surgical robotics suffers from the paucity of datasets that include both visual observations and accurate robot kinematics. In contrast, vast corpora of surgical videos exist, but they lack corresponding action labels, preventing direct application of imitation learning or VLA training. In this work, we aim to alleviate this problem by learning policy models from SurgWorld, a world model designed for surgical physical AI. We curated the Surgical Action Text Alignment (SATA) dataset with detailed action description specifically for surgical robots. Then we built SurgeWorld based on the most advanced physical AI world model and SATA. It's able to generate diverse, generalizable and realistic surgery videos. We are also the first to use an inverse dynamics model to infer pseudokinematics from synthetic surgical videos, producing synthetic paired video action data. We demonstrate that a surgical VLA policy trained with these augmented data significantly outperforms models trained only on real demonstrations on a real surgical robot platform.

Despite ongoing efforts to understand the causes of negative pregnancy outcomes like miscarriage, stillbirths, birth defects, and premature birth, there is still a need for more comprehensive research and strategies for intervention. This paper introduces a novel approach that uses publicly available social media data, especially from platforms like Twitter, to enhance current datasets for studying negative pregnancy outcomes through observational research. The inherent challenges in utilizing social media data, including imbalance, noise, and lack of structure, necessitate robust preprocessing techniques and data augmentation strategies. By constructing a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline, we aim to automatically identify women sharing their pregnancy experiences, categorizing them based on reported outcomes. Women reporting full gestation and normal birth weight will be classified as positive cases, while those reporting negative pregnancy outcomes will be identified as negative cases. Furthermore, this study offers potential applications in assessing the causal impact of specific interventions, treatments, or prenatal exposures on maternal and fetal health outcomes. Additionally, it provides a framework for future health studies involving pregnant cohorts and comparator groups. In a broader context, our research showcases the viability of social media data as an adjunctive resource in epidemiological investigations about pregnancy outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u6570\u636e\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fTwitter\uff09\u6784\u5efaNLP\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u5b55\u5987\u7ecf\u5386\u5e76\u5206\u7c7b\u598a\u5a20\u7ed3\u5c40\uff0c\u4e3a\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u8865\u5145\u6570\u636e\u6e90", "motivation": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u5a74\u513f\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u4ecd\u7136\u5f88\u9ad8\uff0c\u51fa\u751f\u7f3a\u9677\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u826f\u598a\u5a20\u7ed3\u5c40\uff08\u6d41\u4ea7\u3001\u6b7b\u4ea7\u3001\u51fa\u751f\u7f3a\u9677\u3001\u65e9\u4ea7\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8865\u5145\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u516c\u5f00\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u6570\u636e\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fTwitter\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\uff08NLP\uff09\u7ba1\u9053\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u5206\u4eab\u598a\u5a20\u7ecf\u5386\u7684\u5973\u6027\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u62a5\u544a\u7ed3\u5c40\u5206\u7c7b\uff1a\u8db3\u6708\u6b63\u5e38\u4f53\u91cd\u4e3a\u9633\u6027\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u4e0d\u826f\u598a\u5a20\u7ed3\u5c40\u4e3a\u9634\u6027\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u598a\u5a20\u7ed3\u5c40\u7684NLP\u7ba1\u9053\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u826f\u598a\u5a20\u7ed3\u5c40\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u598a\u5a20\u7ed3\u5c40\u7684\u8865\u5145\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u3001\u6cbb\u7597\u6216\u4ea7\u524d\u66b4\u9732\u5bf9\u6bcd\u5a74\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6d89\u53ca\u5b55\u5987\u961f\u5217\u548c\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

To establish more natural and effective human-vehicle interaction, we propose a Human-Oriented Cooperative Driving (HOCD) approach that primarily minimizes human-machine conflict by prioritizing driver intention and state. In implementation, we take both tactical and operational levels into account to ensure seamless human-vehicle cooperation. At the tactical level, we design an intention-aware trajectory planning method, using intention consistency cost as the core metric to evaluate the trajectory and align it with driver intention. At the operational level, we develop a control authority allocation strategy based on reinforcement learning, optimizing the policy through a designed reward function to achieve consistency between driver state and authority allocation. The results of simulation and human-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach not only aligns with driver intention in trajectory planning but also ensures a reasonable authority allocation. Compared to other cooperative driving approaches, the proposed HOCD approach significantly enhances driving performance and mitigates human-machine conflict.The code is available at https://github.com/i-Qin/HOCD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u534f\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08HOCD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u610f\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u673a\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u8f66\u534f\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u673a\u51b2\u7a81\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6218\u672f\u5c42\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u5c42\u53cc\u5c42\u6b21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6218\u672f\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u610f\u56fe\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u610f\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6210\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5c42\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u4eba\u5728\u73af\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u4e0a\u4e0e\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u610f\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5408\u7406\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u534f\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u673a\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684HOCD\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u673a\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4eba\u8f66\u4ea4\u4e92\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Diffusion Language Models (DLLMs) offer parallel decoding by recovering multiple masked tokens per step; however, in practice they often fail to translate this parallelism into deployment speed gains over optimized AR engines (e.g., vLLM). A key reason is that many DLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which breaks standard prefix KV caching and forces repeated contextualization, undermining efficiency. We propose WeDLM, a diffusion decoding framework built entirely on standard causal attention to make parallel generation prefix-cache friendly. The core idea is to let each masked position condition on all currently observed tokens while keeping a strict causal mask, achieved by Topological Reordering that moves observed tokens to the physical prefix while preserving their logical positions. Building on this property, we introduce a streaming decoding procedure that continuously commits confident tokens into a growing left-to-right prefix and maintains a fixed parallel workload, avoiding the stop-and-wait behavior common in block diffusion methods. Experiments show that WeDLM preserves the quality of strong AR backbones while delivering substantial speedups, approaching 3x on challenging reasoning benchmarks and up to 10x in low-entropy generation regimes; critically, our comparisons are against AR baselines served by vLLM under matched deployment settings, demonstrating that diffusion-style decoding can outperform an optimized AR engine in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "WeDLM\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u524d\u7f00\u7f13\u5b58\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684AR\u5f15\u64ce\uff08vLLM\uff09\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b03\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u71b5\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u8fbe\u523010\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\uff08AR\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5e76\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLLMs\uff09\u867d\u7136\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u524d\u7f00KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5e76\u884c\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "WeDLM\u5b8c\u5168\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6784\u5efa\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u5df2\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684token\u79fb\u52a8\u5230\u7269\u7406\u524d\u7f00\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u903b\u8f91\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63a9\u7801\u4f4d\u7f6e\u90fd\u80fd\u6761\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u5f53\u524d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684token\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6d41\u5f0f\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u5c06\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684token\u63d0\u4ea4\u5230\u589e\u957f\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3002", "result": "WeDLM\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5927AR\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd13\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u71b5\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523010\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6bd4\u8f83\u662f\u5728\u4e0evLLM\u670d\u52a1\u7684AR\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u5339\u914d\u90e8\u7f72\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f18\u5316\u7684AR\u5f15\u64ce\u3002", "conclusion": "WeDLM\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5b8c\u5168\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u524d\u7f00\u7f13\u5b58\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f18\u5316AR\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, battery limitations often constrain their effectiveness, necessitating the development of optimized flight paths and data collection techniques. While existing approaches like coverage path planning (CPP) ensure comprehensive data collection, they can be inefficient, especially when inspecting multiple non connected Regions of Interest (ROIs). This paper introduces the Fast Inspection of Scattered Regions (FISR) problem and proposes a novel solution, the multi UAV Disjoint Areas Inspection (mUDAI) method. The introduced approach implements a two fold optimization procedure, for calculating the best image capturing positions and the most efficient UAV trajectories, balancing data resolution and operational time, minimizing redundant data collection and resource consumption. The mUDAI method is designed to enable rapid, efficient inspections of scattered ROIs, making it ideal for applications such as security infrastructure assessments, agricultural inspections, and emergency site evaluations. A combination of simulated evaluations and real world deployments is used to validate and quantify the method's ability to improve operational efficiency while preserving high quality data capture, demonstrating its effectiveness in real world operations. An open source Python implementation of the mUDAI method can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/soc12/mUDAI) and the collected and processed data from the real world experiments are all hosted on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/13866483).

This study proposes an explainability centered workflow that integrates Shapley-value attribution with physics-based obstacle avoidance evaluation for the ROBOTIS OpenManipulator-X. Building upon the original IKNet, two lightweight variants-Improved IKNet with residual connections and Focused IKNet with position-orientation decoupling are trained on a large, synthetically generated pose-joint dataset. SHAP is employed to derive both global and local importance rankings, while the InterpretML toolkit visualizes partial-dependence patterns that expose non-linear couplings between Cartesian poses and joint angles. To bridge algorithmic insight and robotic safety, each network is embedded in a simulator that subjects the arm to randomized single and multi-obstacle scenes; forward kinematics, capsule-based collision checks, and trajectory metrics quantify the relationship between attribution balance and physical clearance. Qualitative heat maps reveal that architectures distributing importance more evenly across pose dimensions tend to maintain wider safety margins without compromising positional accuracy. The combined analysis demonstrates that explainable AI(XAI) techniques can illuminate hidden failure modes, guide architectural refinements, and inform obstacle aware deployment strategies for learning based IK. The proposed methodology thus contributes a concrete path toward trustworthy, data-driven manipulation that aligns with emerging responsible-AI standards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408SHAP\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7269\u7406\u907f\u969c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9006\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728ROBOTIS OpenManipulator-X\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u867d\u7136\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u9006\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u4e0e\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u6cd5\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u76f8\u77db\u76fe\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5b66\u4e60\u578bIK\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "1. \u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbIKNet\u5f00\u53d1\u4e24\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u53d8\u4f53\uff1a\u5e26\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u7684Improved IKNet\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e-\u59ff\u6001\u89e3\u8026\u7684Focused IKNet\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528SHAP\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u7528InterpretML\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u90e8\u5206\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b3. \u5728\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u5355/\u591a\u969c\u788d\u7269\u573a\u666f\u3001\u524d\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u3001\u80f6\u56ca\u78b0\u649e\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u5c5e\u6027\u5e73\u8861\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u95f4\u9699\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u6027\u70ed\u56fe\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u59ff\u6001\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u66f4\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4fdd\u6301\u66f4\u5bbd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u88d5\u5ea6\u800c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eXAI\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684IK\u63d0\u4f9b\u907f\u969c\u611f\u77e5\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u5177\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6280\u672f\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u9006\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Although many approaches have been proposed to address the subtle emotions in different modalities, the power of explanations and temporal alignments is still underexplored. Thus, this paper proposes the Text-routed sparse mixture-of-Experts model with eXplanation and Temporal alignment for MSA (TEXT). TEXT first augments explanations for MSA via Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM), and then novelly aligns the epresentations of audio and video through a temporality-oriented neural network block. TEXT aligns different modalities with explanations and facilitates a new text-routed sparse mixture-of-experts with gate fusion. Our temporal alignment block merges the benefits of Mamba and temporal cross-attention. As a result, TEXT achieves the best performance cross four datasets among all tested models, including three recently proposed approaches and three MLLMs. TEXT wins on at least four metrics out of all six metrics. For example, TEXT decreases the mean absolute error to 0.353 on the CH-SIMS dataset, which signifies a 13.5% decrement compared with recently proposed approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "TEXT\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u5e8f\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8def\u7531\u7a00\u758f\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u5fae\u5999\u60c5\u611f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3aMSA\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u5e8f\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5757\u5bf9\u9f50\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u793a\uff1b3) \u91c7\u7528\u6587\u672c\u8def\u7531\u7a00\u758f\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u4e0e\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff1b4) \u7ed3\u5408Mamba\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u4e2a\u6700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4e09\u4e2aMLLM\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e2d\u81f3\u5c11\u8d62\u5f97\u56db\u4e2a\u3002\u5728CH-SIMS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u81f30.353\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e13.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "TEXT\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u91ca\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, low-resource languages such as Urdu have received limited attention in this domain. An obvious approach is to utilize a multilingual pretrained language model and fine-tune it for a downstream classification task, such as misinformation detection. However, these models struggle with domain-specific terms, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we investigate the effectiveness of domain adaptation before fine-tuning for fake news classification in Urdu, employing a staged training approach to optimize model generalization. We evaluate two widely used multilingual models, XLM-RoBERTa and mBERT, and apply domain-adaptive pretraining using a publicly available Urdu news corpus. Experiments on four publicly available Urdu fake news datasets show that domain-adapted XLM-R consistently outperforms its vanilla counterpart, while domain-adapted mBERT exhibits mixed results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5728\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0XLM-RoBERTa\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u540e\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u800cmBERT\u7ed3\u679c\u6df7\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u7403\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u7b49\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u6b64\u9886\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\u3002\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u672f\u8bed\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5bf9XLM-RoBERTa\u548cmBERT\u8fdb\u884c\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u65b0\u95fb\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684XLM-RoBERTa\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u800cmBERT\u7684\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ed3\u679c\u597d\u574f\u53c2\u534a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9XLM-RoBERTa\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Computing the optimal allocation of several agents to numerous tasks through a brute-force approach can be infeasible, especially when each task's performance scales differently with the increase of agents. For example, difficult tasks may require more agents to achieve similar performances compared to simpler tasks, but performance may saturate nonlinearly as the number of allocated agents increases. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm, based on marginal performance gains, for optimally allocating agents to tasks with concave scalability functions, including linear, saturating, and retrograde scaling, to achieve maximum collective performance. We test the algorithm by allocating a simulated robot swarm among collective decision-making tasks, where embodied agents sample their environment and exchange information to reach a consensus on spatially distributed environmental features. We vary task difficulties by different geometrical arrangements of environmental features in space (patchiness). In this scenario, decision performance in each task scales either as a saturating curve (following the Condorcet's Jury Theorem in an interference-free setup) or as a retrograde curve (when physical interference among robots restricts their movement). Using simple robot simulations, we show that our algorithm can be useful in allocating robots among tasks.

When integrated into robots, ToM allows them to adapt their internal models to users' behaviors, enhancing the interpretability and predictability of their actions. Similarly, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to make AI systems transparent and interpretable, allowing humans to understand and interact with them effectively. Since ToM in HRI serves related purposes, we propose to consider ToM as a form of XAI and evaluate it through the eValuation XAI (VXAI) framework and its seven desiderata. This paper identifies a critical gap in the application of ToM within HRI, as existing methods rarely assess the extent to which explanations correspond to the robot's actual internal reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose to integrate ToM within XAI frameworks. By embedding ToM principles inside XAI, we argue for a shift in perspective, as current XAI research focuses predominantly on the AI system itself and often lacks user-centered explanations. Incorporating ToM would enable a change in focus, prioritizing the user's informational needs and perspective.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7VXAI\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524dToM\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9645\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u5f88\u5c11\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ee5\u7528\u6237\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\u6574\u5408\u5230\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f7f\u7528eValuation XAI\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u5176\u4e03\u4e2a\u671f\u671b\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30ToM\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06ToM\u539f\u5219\u5d4c\u5165XAI\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5411\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86HRI\u4e2dToM\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6574\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06ToM\u89c6\u4e3aXAI\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\u6574\u5408\u5230\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524dHRI\u4e2dToM\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5230\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89e3\u91ca\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u7528\u6237\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Among the SM platforms, Reddit provides a unique space for its users to anonymously express their experiences and thoughts on sensitive issues such as health and daily life. In this work, we present a novel dataset, called NepEMO, for multi-label emotion (MLE) and sentiment classification (SC) on the Nepali subreddit post. We curate and build a manually annotated dataset of 4,462 posts (January 2019- June 2025) written in English, Romanised Nepali and Devanagari script for five emotions (fear, anger, sadness, joy, and depression) and three sentiment classes (positive, negative, and neutral). We perform a detailed analysis of posts to capture linguistic insights, including emotion trends, co-occurrence of emotions, sentiment-specific n-grams, and topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and TF-IDF keyword extraction. Finally, we compare various traditional machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and transformer models for MLE and SC tasks. The result shows that transformer models consistently outperform the ML and DL models for both tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aNepEMO\u7684\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u8bedReddit\u5e16\u5b50\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b4,462\u4e2a\u5e16\u5b50\uff0c\u6db5\u76d65\u79cd\u60c5\u7eea\u548c3\u79cd\u60c5\u611f\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e73\u53f0\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fReddit\uff09\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u533f\u540d\u8868\u8fbe\u654f\u611f\u8bdd\u9898\uff08\u5982\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u751f\u6d3b\uff09\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u8bed\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u9762\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u8bed\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "1. \u6784\u5efaNepEMO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1a\u6536\u96c62019\u5e741\u6708\u81f32025\u5e746\u6708\u76844,462\u4e2a\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u8bedReddit\u5e16\u5b50\uff08\u5305\u542b\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u8bed\u548c\u5929\u57ce\u4f53\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u8bed\uff09\uff1b2. \u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce85\u79cd\u60c5\u7eea\uff08\u6050\u60e7\u3001\u6124\u6012\u3001\u60b2\u4f24\u3001\u559c\u60a6\u3001\u6291\u90c1\uff09\u548c3\u79cd\u60c5\u611f\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u79ef\u6781\u3001\u6d88\u6781\u3001\u4e2d\u6027\uff09\uff1b3. \u8fdb\u884c\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u60c5\u7eea\u8d8b\u52bf\u3001\u60c5\u7eea\u5171\u73b0\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u7279\u5b9an-gram\u5206\u6790\uff1b4. \u4f7f\u7528LDA\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u548cTF-IDF\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u63d0\u53d6\uff1b5. \u6bd4\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548cTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728MLE\u548cSC\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "1. \u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b4,462\u4e2a\u6807\u6ce8\u5e16\u5b50\u7684NepEMO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b2. \u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u8bed\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u5e03\uff1b3. \u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728MLE\u548cSC\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684NepEMO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u8bed\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u8bed\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Diesel-hydraulic systems have long dominated, so full electrification, via direct replacement or redesign, raises major technical and economic challenges. Although advanced artificial intelligence (AI) could enable higher autonomy, adoption in HDMMs is limited by strict safety requirements, and these machines still rely heavily on human supervision.\n  This dissertation develops a control framework that (1) simplifies control design for electrified HDMMs through a generic modular approach that is energy-source independent and supports future modifications, and (2) defines hierarchical control policies that partially integrate AI while guaranteeing safety-defined performance and stability.\n  Five research questions align with three lines of investigation: a generic robust control strategy for multi-body HDMMs with strong stability across actuation types and energy sources; control solutions that keep strict performance under uncertainty and faults while balancing robustness and responsiveness; and methods to interpret and trust black-box learning strategies so they can be integrated stably and verified against international safety standards.\n  The framework is validated in three case studies spanning different actuators and conditions, covering heavy-duty mobile robots and robotic manipulators. Results appear in five peer-reviewed publications and one unpublished manuscript, advancing nonlinear control and robotics and supporting both transitions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u578b\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\u7684\u901a\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u67f4\u6cb9\u6db2\u538b\u5230\u7535\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u90e8\u5206\u6574\u5408AI\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u578b\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u8f6c\u578b\uff1a\u4ece\u67f4\u6cb9\u6db2\u538b\u9a71\u52a8\u5411\u6e05\u6d01\u7535\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f6c\u578b\uff08\u6c14\u5019\u76ee\u6807\u9a71\u52a8\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ece\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u5411\u66f4\u9ad8\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u8f6c\u578b\u3002\u67f4\u6cb9\u6db2\u538b\u7cfb\u7edf\u957f\u671f\u5360\u636e\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u7535\u6c14\u5316\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u5927\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5148\u8fdbAI\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u91cd\u578b\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5668\u4ecd\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a(1) \u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5316\u7535\u6c14\u5316\u91cd\u578b\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u80fd\u6e90\u6765\u6e90\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u672a\u6765\u4fee\u6539\uff1b(2) \u5b9a\u4e49\u5206\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6574\u5408AI\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u8def\u7ebf\u89e3\u51b3\u4e94\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u4f53\u91cd\u578b\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\u7684\u901a\u7528\u9c81\u68d2\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6545\u969c\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e25\u683c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u9ed1\u76d2\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6267\u884c\u5668\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u91cd\u578b\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u7eb5\u5668\u3002\u6210\u679c\u53d1\u8868\u5728\u4e94\u7bc7\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8bba\u6587\u548c\u4e00\u7bc7\u672a\u53d1\u8868\u624b\u7a3f\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e24\u5927\u8f6c\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u91cd\u578b\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\u53cc\u91cd\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e2\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u7535\u6c14\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u53c8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86AI\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u884c\u4e1a\u8f6c\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While visual goals provide a compact and unambiguous task specification, existing goal-conditioned policies often struggle with long-horizon manipulation due to their reliance on single-step action prediction without explicit modeling of task progress. We propose Act2Goal, a general goal-conditioned manipulation policy that integrates a goal-conditioned visual world model with multi-scale temporal control. Given a current observation and a target visual goal, the world model generates a plausible sequence of intermediate visual states that captures long-horizon structure. To translate this visual plan into robust execution, we introduce Multi-Scale Temporal Hashing (MSTH), which decomposes the imagined trajectory into dense proximal frames for fine-grained closed-loop control and sparse distal frames that anchor global task consistency. The policy couples these representations with motor control through end-to-end cross-attention, enabling coherent long-horizon behavior while remaining reactive to local disturbances. Act2Goal achieves strong zero-shot generalization to novel objects, spatial layouts, and environments. We further enable reward-free online adaptation through hindsight goal relabeling with LoRA-based finetuning, allowing rapid autonomous improvement without external supervision. Real-robot experiments demonstrate that Act2Goal improves success rates from 30% to 90% on challenging out-of-distribution tasks within minutes of autonomous interaction, validating that goal-conditioned world models with multi-scale temporal control provide structured guidance necessary for robust long-horizon manipulation.

A Deep Dive into Next Token Prediction", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent advancements have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially improve the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The effectiveness of such RL training, however, depends critically on the exploration space defined by the pre-trained model's token-output distribution. In this paper, we revisit the standard cross-entropy loss, interpreting it as a specific instance of policy gradient optimization applied within a single-step episode. To systematically study how the pre-trained distribution shapes the exploration potential for subsequent RL, we propose a generalized pre-training objective that adapts on-policy RL principles to supervised learning. By framing next-token prediction as a stochastic decision process, we introduce a reward-shaping strategy that explicitly balances diversity and precision. Our method employs a positive reward scaling factor to control probability concentration on ground-truth tokens and a rank-aware mechanism that treats high-ranking and low-ranking negative tokens asymmetrically. This allows us to reshape the pre-trained token-output distribution and investigate how to provide a more favorable exploration space for RL, ultimately enhancing end-to-end reasoning performance. Contrary to the intuition that higher distribution entropy facilitates effective exploration, we find that imposing a precision-oriented prior yields a superior exploration space for RL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u5219\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u4f18\u5316LLM\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u679c\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684token\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u6240\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u6807\u51c6\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u540e\u7eedRL\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6807\u51c6\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u5355\u6b65episode\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e7f\u4e49\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2atoken\u9884\u6d4b\u89c6\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u9020\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u5956\u52b1\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u5bf9ground-truth token\u7684\u6982\u7387\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u79e9\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6392\u540d\u548c\u4f4e\u6392\u540d\u8d1ftoken\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u91cd\u5851\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684token\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0e\u76f4\u89c9\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u65bd\u52a0\u9762\u5411\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\uff08\u800c\u975e\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u71b5\uff09\u80fd\u4e3aRL\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u5347\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06on-policy RL\u539f\u5219\u878d\u5165\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u540e\u7eedRL\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6709\u5229\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Through a focus group with twelve creative technologists, we then used Sumbrella as a technological probe to explore how people interpreted, interacted, and imagined future relationships with soft robotic wearables.

We contribute to the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) field key considerations and recommendations for designing soft robotic garments, including the potential for kinesic communication, the impact of such technologies on social dynamics, and the importance of ethical guidelines.

In this study, we evaluated the performance of three state-of-the-art LLMs-ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and LIama 3.3 70B-in clinical decision support across the entire clinical reasoning workflow of a typical patient encounter. Using 36 case studies, we first assessed LLM's out-of-the-box performance across five key sequential clinical decision-making tasks under two temperature settings (default vs. zero): differential diagnosis, essential immediate steps, relevant diagnostic testing, final diagnosis, and treatment recommendation. All models showed high variability by task, achieving near-perfect accuracy in final diagnosis, poor performance in relevant diagnostic testing, and moderate performance in remaining tasks. Furthermore, ChatGPT performed better under the zero temperature, whereas LIama showed stronger performance under the default temperature. Next, we assessed whether prompt engineering could enhance LLM performance by applying variations of the MedPrompt framework, incorporating targeted and random dynamic few-shot learning. The results demonstrate that prompt engineering is not a one-size-fit-all solution. While it significantly improved the performance on the task with lowest baseline accuracy (relevant diagnostic testing), it was counterproductive for others. Another key finding was that the targeted dynamic few-shot prompting did not consistently outperform random selection, indicating that the presumed benefits of closely matched examples may be counterbalanced by loss of broader contextual diversity.

We leverage the recently proposed Deep Isolation Forest (DIF), an anomaly detection algorithm that combines neural network-based feature representations with Isolation Forests (IFs), to identify non-linear and complex anomalies. Data from perception modules, capturing vehicle dynamics and environmental conditions, is preprocessed into structured statistical features extracted from sliding windows. The framework incorporates t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for dimensionality reduction and visualization, enabling better interpretability of detected anomalies. Evaluation is conducted using a proxy ground truth, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative video frame inspection. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively identifies rare and hazardous driving scenarios, providing a scalable solution for anomaly detection in autonomous driving systems. Given the study's methodology, it was unavoidable to depend on proxy ground truth and manually defined feature combinations, which do not encompass the full range of real-world driving anomalies or their nuanced contextual dependencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u9694\u79bb\u68ee\u6797\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f55\u89c1\u548c\u5371\u9669\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u9694\u79bb\u68ee\u6797\u7ed3\u5408\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7f55\u89c1\u548c\u5371\u9669\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u9694\u79bb\u68ee\u6797\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u548c\u9694\u79bb\u68ee\u6797\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b\u4ece\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u5904\u7406\uff1b\u91c7\u7528t-SNE\u8fdb\u884c\u964d\u7ef4\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u7f55\u89c1\u548c\u5371\u9669\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u4ee3\u7406\u771f\u503c\u548c\u624b\u52a8\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f55\u89c1\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u4ee3\u7406\u771f\u503c\u548c\u624b\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u8986\u76d6\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u9a7e\u9a76\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u5168\u90e8\u8303\u56f4\u53ca\u5176\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Post-training structured pruning offers an efficient solution. However, when few-shot calibration sets fail to adequately reflect the pretraining data distribution, existing methods exhibit limited generalization to downstream tasks. To address this issue, we propose Function-Aware Neuron Grouping (FANG), a post-training pruning framework that alleviates calibration bias by identifying and preserving neurons critical to specific function. FANG groups neurons with similar function based on the type of semantic context they process and prunes each group independently. During importance estimation within each group, tokens that strongly correlate with the functional role of the neuron group are given higher weighting. Additionally, FANG also preserves neurons that contribute across multiple context types. To achieve a better trade-off between sparsity and performance, it allocates sparsity to each block adaptively based on its functional complexity. Experiments show that FANG improves downstream accuracy while preserving language modeling performance. It achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results when combined with FLAP and OBC, two representative pruning methods. Specifically, FANG outperforms FLAP and OBC by 1.5%--8.5% in average accuracy under 30% and 40% sparsity.", "AI": {"tldr": "FANG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u529f\u80fd\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5206\u7ec4\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6821\u51c6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\u4e0d\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u53cd\u6620\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFunction-Aware Neuron Grouping (FANG)\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u6839\u636e\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7c7b\u578b\u5c06\u529f\u80fd\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5206\u7ec4\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ec4\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u65f6\uff0c\u7ed9\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7ec4\u529f\u80fd\u89d2\u8272\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u7684token\u66f4\u9ad8\u6743\u91cd\uff1b3\uff09\u4fdd\u7559\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7c7b\u578b\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff1b4\uff09\u6839\u636e\u529f\u80fd\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5757\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "FANG\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u4e0eFLAP\u548cOBC\u4e24\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u572830%\u548c40%\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53471.5%-8.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "FANG\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5206\u7ec4\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6821\u51c6\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u66f4\u597d\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u526a\u679d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, they are susceptible to high-frequency disturbances from unintentional driver torque, known as driver impedance, which can degrade steering performance. Existing approaches either rely on direct torque sensors, which are costly and impractical, or lack the temporal resolution to capture rapid, high-frequency driver-induced disturbances. We address this limitation by designing a Kalman filter-based disturbance observer that estimates high-frequency driver torque using only motor state measurements. We model the drivers passive torque as an extended state using a PT1-lag approximation and integrate it into both linear and nonlinear Steer-by-Wire system models. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and simulation of this disturbance observer with an evaluation of different Kalman filter variants. Our findings indicate that the proposed disturbance observer accurately reconstructs driver-induced disturbances with only minimal delay 14ms. We show that a nonlinear extended Kalman Filter outperforms its linear counterpart in handling frictional nonlinearities, improving estimation during transitions from static to dynamic friction.

Current LLMs cannot natively ingest long-duration sensor streams, and paired sensor-text datasets are scarce. To address these challenges, we introduce LENS, a framework that aligns multimodal sensing data with language models to generate clinically grounded mental-health narratives. LENS first constructs a large-scale dataset by transforming Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) responses related to depression and anxiety symptoms into natural-language descriptions, yielding over 100,000 sensor-text QA pairs from 258 participants. To enable native time-series integration, we train a patch-level encoder that projects raw sensor signals directly into an LLM's representation space. Our results show that LENS outperforms strong baselines on standard NLP metrics and task-specific measures of symptom-severity accuracy. A user study with 13 mental-health professionals further indicates that LENS-produced narratives are comprehensive and clinically meaningful.

As a result, collaborative robots, despite their advanced sensing and control capabilities, are rarely used for surface finishing in small-scale craft and manufacturing settings. To address this gap, we propose a novel robot programming approach that enables non-experts to intuitively program robots through interactive, task-focused workflows. For that, we developed a new surface segmentation algorithm that incorporates human input to identify and refine workpiece regions for processing. Throughout the programming process, users receive continuous visual feedback on the robot's learned model, enabling them to iteratively refine the segmentation result. Based on the segmented surface model, a robot trajectory is generated to cover the desired processing area.

We argue this metric confuses unfaithfulness with incompleteness, the lossy compression needed to turn distributed transformer computation into a linear natural language narrative. On multi-hop reasoning tasks with Llama-3 and Gemma-3, many CoTs flagged as unfaithful by Biasing Features are judged faithful by other metrics, exceeding 50% in some models. With a new faithful@k metric, we show that larger inference-time token budgets greatly increase hint verbalization (up to 90% in some settings), suggesting much apparent unfaithfulness is due to tight token limits. Using Causal Mediation Analysis, we further show that even non-verbalized hints can causally mediate prediction changes through the CoT. We therefore caution against relying solely on hint-based evaluations and advocate a broader interpretability toolkit, including causal mediation and corruption-based metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6279\u8bc4Biasing Features\u6307\u6807\u5c06\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u8bef\u5224\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u663e\u793a\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406token\u9884\u7b97\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u793a\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u663e\u6027\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Biasing Features\u6307\u6807\u5c06\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u4e2d\u672a\u663e\u6027\u8868\u8fbe\u63d0\u793a\u7ebf\u7d22\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a\"\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\"\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e86\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5c06\u5206\u5e03\u5f0ftransformer\u8ba1\u7b97\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u53d9\u8ff0\u5fc5\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u3002", "method": "1) \u5728Llama-3\u548cGemma-3\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u5224\u65ad\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fafaithful@k\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540ctoken\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u7ebf\u7d22\u663e\u6027\u8868\u8fbe\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u672a\u663e\u6027\u8868\u8fbe\u7ebf\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u901a\u8fc7\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u56e0\u679c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5f71\u54cd\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "1) Biasing Features\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc750%\u88ab\u5176\u4ed6\u6307\u6807\u5224\u5b9a\u4e3a\u5fe0\u5b9e\uff1b2) \u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406token\u9884\u7b97\u53ef\u4f7f\u7ebf\u7d22\u663e\u6027\u8868\u8fbe\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u81f390%\uff1b3) \u56e0\u679c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5373\u4f7f\u672a\u663e\u6027\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e5f\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u56e0\u679c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5f71\u54cd\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u5e94\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5176\u5c06\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u8bef\u5224\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u56e0\u679c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5206\u6790\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7834\u574f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u3002"}}

This work departs from that paradigm to investigate the intrinsic topological structure of the optimization landscape itself. We formulate the design problem on the product manifold of Projective Lines \\RP^2^N, fixing the rotor positions to the vertices of polyhedral chassis while varying their lines of action. By minimizing a coordinate-invariant Log-Volume isotropy metric, we reveal that the topology of the global optima is governed strictly by the symmetry of the chassis. For generic (irregular) vertex arrangements, the solutions appear as a discrete set of isolated points. However, as the chassis geometry approaches regularity, the solution space undergoes a critical phase transition, collapsing onto an N-dimensional Torus of the lines tangent at the vertexes to the circumscribing sphere of the chassis, and subsequently reducing to continuous 1-dimensional curves driven by Affine Phase Locking. We synthesize these observations into the N-5 Scaling Law: an empirical relationship holding for all examined regular planar polygons and Platonic solids (N <= 10), where the space of optimal configurations consists of K=N-5 disconnected 1D topological branches. We demonstrate that these locking patterns correspond to a sequence of admissible Star Polygons {N/q}, allowing for the exact prediction of optimal phases for arbitrary N. Crucially, this topology reveals a design redundancy that enables optimality-preserving morphing: the vehicle can continuously reconfigure along these branches while preserving optimal isotropic control authority.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86N\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\u51e0\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u968f\u5e95\u76d8\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u5448\u73b0\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86N-5\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u91cd\u6784\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfN\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bfb\u627e\u5355\u4e00\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u5185\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u8ff0\u5728\u5c04\u5f71\u7ebf\u4e58\u79ef\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a\u8f6c\u5b50\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e8e\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u5e95\u76d8\u9876\u70b9\uff0c\u53d8\u5316\u5176\u4f5c\u7528\u7ebf\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5750\u6807\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684Log-Volume\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u5206\u6790\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u5168\u7531\u5e95\u76d8\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u51b3\u5b9a\uff1a\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u9876\u70b9\u6392\u5217\u4ea7\u751f\u79bb\u6563\u5b64\u7acb\u70b9\u89e3\uff1b\u89c4\u5219\u51e0\u4f55\u4f53\u65f6\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d1\u751f\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u5f62\u6210N\u7ef4\u73af\u9762\uff1b\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u51faN-5\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6240\u6709\u89c4\u5219\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u548c\u67cf\u62c9\u56fe\u7acb\u4f53\uff08N\u226410\uff09\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u914d\u7f6e\u7531K=N-5\u4e2a\u4e0d\u8fde\u901a\u76841\u7ef4\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u652f\u7ec4\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5197\u4f59\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u98de\u884c\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u6cbf\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u652f\u8fde\u7eed\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3aN\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, state-of-the-art humanoid locomotion systems rely on either curated motion capture trajectories or sparse text commands, leaving a critical gap between visual understanding and control. Text-to-motion methods suffer from semantic sparsity and staged pipeline errors, while video-based approaches only perform mechanical pose mimicry without genuine visual understanding. We propose RoboMirror, the first retargeting-free video-to-locomotion framework embodying \"understand before you imitate\". Leveraging VLMs, it distills raw egocentric/third-person videos into visual motion intents, which directly condition a diffusion-based policy to generate physically plausible, semantically aligned locomotion without explicit pose reconstruction or retargeting. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RoboMirror, it enables telepresence via egocentric videos, drastically reduces third-person control latency by 80%, and achieves a 3.7% higher task success rate than baselines.

ModernBERT consolidates these advances by integrating Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), FlashAttention, and refined normalization. Despite these developments, Turkish NLP lacks a monolingual encoder trained from scratch incorporating such modern architectural paradigms. This work introduces TabiBERT, a monolingual Turkish encoder based on ModernBERT architecture trained from scratch on a large, curated corpus. TabiBERT is pre-trained on one trillion tokens sampled from an 84.88B token multi-domain corpus: web text (73%), scientific publications (20%), source code (6%), and mathematical content (0.3%). The model supports 8,192-token context length (16x original BERT), achieves up to 2.65x inference speedup, and reduces GPU memory consumption, enabling larger batch sizes. We introduce TabiBench with 28 datasets across eight task categories with standardized splits and protocols, evaluated using GLUE-style macro-averaging.

Generating motion from audio and then retargeting it to robots relies on explicit motion reconstruction, leading to cascaded errors, high latency, and disjointed acoustic-actuation mapping. We propose RoboPerform, the first unified audio-to-locomotion framework that can directly generate music-driven dance and speech-driven co-speech gestures from audio. Guided by the core principle of \"motion = content + style\", the framework treats audio as implicit style signals and eliminates the need for explicit motion reconstruction. RoboPerform integrates a ResMoE teacher policy for adapting to diverse motion patterns and a diffusion-based student policy for audio style injection. This retargeting-free design ensures low latency and high fidelity.

Among the various techniques, Artificial Potential Field (APF) methods have gained popularity due to their simplicity, real-time responsiveness, and low computational requirements. However, a major limitation of conventional APF approaches is the local minima trap problem, where the robot becomes stuck in a position with no clear direction toward the goal. This paper proposes a novel path planning technique, termed the Bulldozer, which addresses the local minima issue while preserving the inherent advantages of APF. The Bulldozer technique introduces a backfilling mechanism that systematically identifies and eliminates local minima regions by increasing their potential values, analogous to a bulldozer filling potholes in a road. Additionally, a ramp-based enhancement is incorporated to assist the robot in escaping trap areas when starting within a local minimum. The proposed technique is experimentally validated using a physical mobile robot across various maps with increasing complexity.

How do large language models (LLMs) perform in generating them? How are LLM-generated summaries different from those written by human experts? However, the lack of a comprehensive, high-quality scientific TLDR dataset hinders both the development and evaluation of LLMs' summarization ability. To address these, we propose a novel dataset, BiomedTLDR, containing a large sample of researcher-authored summaries from scientific papers, which leverages the common practice of including authors' comments alongside bibliography items. We then test popular open-weight LLMs for generating TLDRs based on abstracts. Our analysis reveals that, although some of them successfully produce humanoid summaries, LLMs generally exhibit a greater affinity for the original text's lexical choices and rhetorical structures, hence tend to be more extractive rather than abstractive in general, compared to humans.

While recently learning-based Process Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising direction, they are often hindered by two fundamental limitations: their reward models lack step-aware understanding and rely on single-view perception, leading to unreliable assessments of fine-grained manipulation progress; and their reward shaping procedures are theoretically unsound, often inducing a semantic trap that misguides policy optimization. To address these, we introduce Dopamine-Reward, a novel reward modeling method for learning a general-purpose, step-aware process reward model from multi-view inputs. At its core is our General Reward Model (GRM), trained on a vast 3,400+ hour dataset, which leverages Step-wise Reward Discretization for structural understanding and Multi-Perspective Reward Fusion to overcome perceptual limitations. Building upon Dopamine-Reward, we propose Dopamine-RL, a robust policy learning framework that employs a theoretically-sound Policy-Invariant Reward Shaping method, which enables the agent to leverage dense rewards for efficient self-improvement without altering the optimal policy, thereby fundamentally avoiding the semantic trap. Extensive experiments across diverse simulated and real-world tasks validate our approach. GRM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in reward assessment, and Dopamine-RL built on GRM significantly improves policy learning efficiency. For instance, after GRM is adapted to a new task in a one-shot manner from a single expert trajectory, the resulting reward model enables Dopamine-RL to improve the policy from near-zero to 95% success with only 150 online rollouts (approximately 1 hour of real robot interaction), while retaining strong generalization across tasks.

Despite having zero prior training exposure to Anka, Claude 3.5 Haiku achieves 99.9% parse success and 95.8% overall task accuracy across 100 benchmark problems. Critically, Anka demonstrates a 40 percentage point accuracy advantage over Python on multi-step pipeline tasks (100% vs. 60%), where Python's flexible syntax leads to frequent errors in operation sequencing and variable management. Cross-model validation with GPT-4o-mini confirms this advantage (+26.7 percentage points on multi-step tasks). Our results demonstrate that: (1) LLMs can learn novel DSLs entirely from in-context prompts, achieving near-native accuracy; (2) constrained syntax significantly reduces errors on complex tasks; and (3) domain-specific languages purposefully designed for LLM generation can outperform general-purpose languages on which the LLM has extensive training.

Low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA operate under the assumption that task-relevant weight updates reside in a low-rank subspace, yet this subspace is learned implicitly from data in a black-box manner, offering no interpretability or direct control. We hypothesize that this difficulty stems from polysemanticity--individual dimensions encoding multiple entangled concepts. To address this, we leverage pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant features in a disentangled feature space, then construct an explicit, interpretable low-rank subspace to guide adapter initialization. We provide theoretical analysis proving that under monosemanticity assumptions, SAE-based subspace identification achieves arbitrarily small recovery error, while direct identification in polysemantic space suffers an irreducible error floor. On safety alignment, our method achieves up to 99.6% safety rate--exceeding full fine-tuning by 7.4 percentage points and approaching RLHF-based methods--while updating only 0.19-0.24% of parameters. Crucially, our method provides interpretable insights into the learned alignment subspace through the semantic grounding of SAE features.

To achieve these goals, we develop a framework composed of 11 specialized agents,including topic analysts, case analysts, editors, a narrator, and proofreaders that work in concert to explore themes, extract real world cases, refine content organization, and synthesize natural spoken language.

Recent research on autonomous agents has increasingly focused on designing efficient memory workflows by drawing on cognitive neuroscience. However, constrained by interdisciplinary barriers, existing works struggle to assimilate the essence of human memory mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we systematically synthesizes interdisciplinary knowledge of memory, connecting insights from cognitive neuroscience with LLM-driven agents. Specifically, we first elucidate the definition and function of memory along a progressive trajectory from cognitive neuroscience through LLMs to agents.

As their applications extend to increasingly complex scenarios, however, LLMs continue to face challenges in tasks that require deep reasoning and logical inference. In particular, models trained on large scale textual corpora may incorporate noisy or irrelevant information during generation, which can lead to incorrect predictions or outputs that are inconsistent with factual knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose a stepwise reasoning enhancement framework for LLMs based on external subgraph generation, termed SGR. The proposed framework dynamically constructs query relevant subgraphs from external knowledge bases and leverages their semantic structure to guide the reasoning process. By performing reasoning in a step by step manner over structured subgraphs, SGR reduces the influence of noisy information and improves reasoning accuracy. Specifically, the framework first generates an external subgraph tailored to the input query, then guides the model to conduct multi step reasoning grounded in the subgraph, and finally integrates multiple reasoning paths to produce the final answer. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SGR consistently outperforms strong baselines, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u5b50\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6SGR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u5b50\u56fe\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5176\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u6307\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSGR\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4ece\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u5b50\u56fe\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b50\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\uff1b3) \u96c6\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u751f\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSGR\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SGR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u5b50\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u606f\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, autoregressive models often suffer from performance degradation under repeated data exposure, where overfitting leads to a marked decline in model capability. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to an imbalance in learning dynamics: predictable, low-entropy tokens are learned quickly and come to dominate optimization, while the model's ability to generalize on high-entropy tokens deteriorates with continued training. To address this, we introduce EntroDrop, an entropy-guided token dropout method that functions as structured data regularization. EntroDrop selectively masks low-entropy tokens during training and employs a curriculum schedule to adjust regularization strength in alignment with training progress. Experiments across model scales from 0.6B to 8B parameters show that EntroDrop consistently outperforms standard regularization baselines and maintains robust performance throughout extended multi-epoch training. These findings underscore the importance of aligning regularization with token-level learning dynamics when training on limited data. Our approach offers a promising pathway toward more effective adaptation of LLMs in data-constrained domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEntroDrop\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684token dropout\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u8f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u71b5token\u4e0a\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u9886\u57df\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u591a\u8f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u9002\u5e94\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91cd\u590d\u6570\u636e\u66b4\u9732\u4e0b\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u9000\u5316\u6e90\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff1a\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4f4e\u71b5token\u88ab\u5feb\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u71b5token\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u968f\u7740\u6301\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u800c\u6076\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEntroDrop\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684token dropout\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002EntroDrop\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u63a9\u7801\u4f4e\u71b5token\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8868\u8c03\u5ea6\u6765\u6839\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fdb\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u57280.6B\u52308B\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aEntroDrop\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e0etoken\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002EntroDrop\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u9886\u57df\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, prior findings remain inconsistent, and most studies operationalize diversity in aggregate terms, overlooking internal role differentiation. This limitation obscures a more nuanced understanding of how gender diversity shapes team impact. In particular, the effect of gender diversity across different team roles remains poorly understood. To this end, we define a scientific team as all coauthors of a paper and measure team impact through five-year citation counts. Using author contribution statements, we classified members into leadership and support roles. Drawing on more than 130,000 papers from PLOS journals, most of which are in biomedical-related disciplines, we employed multivariable regression to examine the association between gender diversity in these roles and team impact. Furthermore, we apply a threshold regression model to investigate how team size moderates this relationship. The results show that (1) the relationship between gender diversity and team impact follows an inverted U-shape for both leadership and support groups; (2) teams with an all-female leadership group and an all-male support group achieve higher impact than other team types. Interestingly, (3) the effect of leadership-group gender diversity is significantly negative for small teams but becomes positive and statistically insignificant in large teams.

However, prior paradigms typically address these in isolation, often mitigating one at the expense of exacerbating the other. To address this, we conduct a systematic exploration of these reasoning failures and identify a primary inducement: the latent spurious feature correlations within the input that drive these erroneous reasoning shortcuts. Driven by these findings, we introduce Causal-Contrastive Preference Optimization (C2PO), a unified alignment framework designed to tackle these specific failures by simultaneously discovering and suppressing these correlations directly within the optimization process. Specifically, C2PO leverages causal counterfactual signals to isolate bias-inducing features from valid reasoning paths, and employs a fairness-sensitive preference update mechanism to dynamically evaluate logit-level contributions and suppress shortcut features. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks covering stereotypical bias (BBQ, Unqover), structural bias (MNLI, HANS, Chatbot, MT-Bench), out-of-domain fairness (StereoSet, WinoBias), and general utility (MMLU, GSM8K) demonstrate that C2PO effectively mitigates stereotypical and structural biases while preserving robust general reasoning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "C2PO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u654f\u611f\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff08\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u504f\u89c1\uff09\u5bf9\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6784\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5b64\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u4e00\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u5267\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCausal-Contrastive Preference Optimization (C2PO)\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u79bb\u504f\u89c1\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u516c\u5e73\u654f\u611f\u504f\u597d\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30logit\u7ea7\u8d21\u732e\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u6377\u5f84\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08BBQ\u3001Unqover\u3001MNLI\u3001HANS\u3001Chatbot\u3001MT-Bench\u3001StereoSet\u3001WinoBias\u3001MMLU\u3001GSM8K\uff09\u4e0a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cC2PO\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "C2PO\u901a\u8fc7\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u6291\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u865a\u5047\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose expert-router coupling (ERC) loss, a lightweight auxiliary loss that tightly couples the router's decisions with expert capabilities. Our approach treats each expert's router embedding as a proxy token for the tokens assigned to that expert, and feeds perturbed router embeddings through the experts to obtain internal activations. The ERC loss enforces two constraints on these activations: (1) Each expert must exhibit higher activation for its own proxy token than for the proxy tokens of any other expert. (2) Each proxy token must elicit stronger activation from its corresponding expert than from any other expert. These constraints jointly ensure that each router embedding faithfully represents its corresponding expert's capability, while each expert specializes in processing the tokens actually routed to it. The ERC loss is computationally efficient, operating only on n^2 activations, where n is the number of experts. This represents a fixed cost independent of batch size, unlike prior coupling methods that scale with the number of tokens (often millions per batch). Through pre-training MoE-LLMs ranging from 3B to 15B parameters and extensive analysis on trillions of tokens, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ERC loss.

While LLM-embeddings are frequently used to store and retrieve text by semantic similarity in vector databases, the global structure semantic relationships in text corpora often remains opaque. Herein we propose a nested density clustering approach, to infer hierarchical trees of semantically related texts. The method starts by identifying texts of strong semantic similarity as it searches for dense clusters in LLM embedding space. As the density criterion is gradually relaxed, these dense clusters merge into more diffuse clusters, until the whole dataset is represented by a single cluster -- the root of the tree. By embedding dense clusters into increasingly diffuse ones, we construct a tree structure that captures hierarchical semantic relationships among texts. We outline how this approach can be used to classify textual data for abstracts of scientific abstracts as a case study. This enables the data-driven discovery research areas and their subfields without predefined categories. To evaluate the general applicability of the method, we further apply it to established benchmark datasets such as the 20 Newsgroups and IMDB 50k Movie Reviews, demonstrating its robustness across domains. Finally we discuss possible applications on scientometrics, topic evolution, highlighting how nested density trees can reveal semantic structure and evolution in textual datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5d4c\u5957\u5bc6\u5ea6\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u5373\u53ef\u53d1\u73b0\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u53ca\u5176\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136LLM\u5d4c\u5165\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u6587\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5d4c\u5957\u5bc6\u5ea6\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5728LLM\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u641c\u7d22\u5bc6\u96c6\u7c07\uff0c\u9010\u6e10\u653e\u5bbd\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6807\u51c6\u4f7f\u5bc6\u96c6\u7c07\u5408\u5e76\u4e3a\u66f4\u5206\u6563\u7684\u7c07\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5f62\u6210\u5355\u4e2a\u7c07\uff08\u6811\u7684\u6839\u8282\u70b9\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u6355\u83b7\u6587\u672c\u5c42\u6b21\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u6458\u8981\u300120 Newsgroups\u548cIMDB 50k Movie Reviews\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5730\u53d1\u73b0\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u53ca\u5176\u5b50\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5d4c\u5957\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6811\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u91cf\u5b66\u3001\u4e3b\u9898\u6f14\u5316\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Unlike existing text reuse frameworks that struggle with short, paraphrased, or structurally embedded quotations, ACT combines a morphology-aware alignment algorithm with a context-sensitive enrichment stage that identifies complex citation patterns such as \"Wave\" and \"Echo\" quotations.\n  Our approach was evaluated against leading systems, including Dicta, Passim, Text-Matcher, as well as human-annotated critical editions. We further assessed three ACT configurations to isolate the contribution of each component. Results demonstrate that the full ACT pipeline (ACT-QE) outperforms all baselines, achieving an F1 score of 0.91, with superior Recall (0.89) and Precision (0.94). Notably, ACT-2, which lacks stylistic enrichment, achieves higher Recall (0.90) but suffers in Precision, while ACT-3, using longer n-grams, offers a tradeoff between coverage and specificity.\n  In addition to improving quotation detection, ACT's ability to classify stylistic patterns across corpora opens new avenues for genre classification and intertextual analysis. This work contributes to digital humanities and computational philology by addressing the methodological gap between exhaustive machine-based detection and human editorial judgment.

When a prompt implies a preferred answer, models often reinforce that bias rather than explore alternatives. This phenomenon remains underexplored, yet it is already harmful in base models and poses an even greater risk in multi-agent debate, where echo chambers reinforce bias instead of correction. We introduce Mixture of Latent Concept Experts (MoLaCE), a lightweight inference-time framework that addresses confirmation bias by mixing experts instantiated as different activation strengths over latent concepts that shape model responses. Our key insight is that, due to the compositional nature of language, differently phrased prompts reweight latent concepts in prompt-specific ways that affect factual correctness, so no single fixed intervention can be applied universally across inputs. This design enables a single LLM to emulate the benefits of debate internally while remaining computationally efficient and scalable. It can also be integrated into multi-agent debate frameworks to diversify perspectives and reduce correlated errors. We empirically show that it consistently reduces confirmation bias, improves robustness, and matches or surpasses multi-agent debate while requiring only a fraction of the computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoLaCE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u4e13\u5bb6\u6765\u51cf\u5c11LLM\u7684\u786e\u8ba4\u504f\u8bef\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u786e\u8ba4\u504f\u8bef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f53\u63d0\u793a\u6697\u793a\u504f\u597d\u7b54\u6848\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u5f3a\u5316\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u8bef\u800c\u975e\u63a2\u7d22\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e2d\u66f4\u52a0\u5371\u9669\uff0c\u4f1a\u5f62\u6210\u56de\u97f3\u5ba4\u6548\u5e94\u800c\u975e\u7ea0\u6b63\u504f\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMoLaCE\uff08\u6f5c\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u4e13\u5bb6\u6765\u5851\u9020\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u5173\u952e\u6d1e\u89c1\u662f\uff1a\u7531\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u63aa\u8f9e\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f1a\u4ee5\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u5f0f\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u6f5c\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "MoLaCE\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u51cf\u5c11\u786e\u8ba4\u504f\u8bef\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u4ec5\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MoLaCE\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u5355\u4e2aLLM\u80fd\u591f\u5185\u90e8\u6a21\u62df\u8fa9\u8bba\u7684\u597d\u5904\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u4ee5\u591a\u6837\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u76f8\u5173\u9519\u8bef\u3002"}}

Specifically, we propose a simple yet powerful approach that enriches hallucination self-detection by (i) converting LLM responses into knowledge graphs of entities and relations, and (ii) using these graphs to estimate the likelihood that a response contains hallucinations. We evaluate the proposed approach using two widely used LLMs, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, across two hallucination detection datasets. To support more reliable future benchmarking, one of these datasets has been manually curated and enhanced and is released as a secondary outcome of this work. Compared to standard self-detection methods and SelfCheckGPT, a state-of-the-art approach, our method achieves up to 16% relative improvement in accuracy and 20% in F1-score.

However, it has been observed that LVLMs, after tuning to visual instruction using commonly used training datasets, often fail to exhibit the instruction-following ability that was present in the LLM before integration, leading to results in which they do not follow task instructions as expected. This study quantitatively demonstrates that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning and analyzes its underlying causes. In particular, we constructed new training datasets highlighting whether the output format is specified. Then, we investigated how explicitly indicating the output format during fine-tuning affects LVLMs' instruction-following ability. Our quantitative evaluation confirmed that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning with commonly used datasets. Furthermore, we found that LVLMs trained with datasets, including instructions on output format, tend to follow instructions more accurately than models that do not. These findings suggest that including samples with instructions on output format during (visual) instruction tuning may help mitigate the decline in instruction-following abilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\uff0c\u5176\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u4f1a\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f\u8bf4\u660e\u53ef\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96c6\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u89c9\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u5931\u53bb\u539f\u672c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u6309\u7167\u4efb\u52a1\u6307\u4ee4\u9884\u671f\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f\u662f\u5426\u88ab\u660e\u786e\u6307\u5b9a\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u660e\u786e\u6307\u793a\u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdLVLMs\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc1\u5b9eLVLMs\u5728\u5e38\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u786e\u5b9e\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u5305\u542b\u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f\u8bf4\u660e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u4e0d\u5305\u542b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9075\u5faa\u6307\u4ee4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u5e26\u6709\u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f\u8bf4\u660e\u7684\u6837\u672c\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdbLVLMs\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

We evaluate three proprietary and two open-source SLMs, demonstrating that none of these models can maintain a consistent speaking style when instructed to do so. We further show that when SLMs are asked to recall the style instruction in later turns, they can recall the style instruction, but they fail to express it throughout the conversation. We also show that explicitly asking the model to recall the style instruction can partially mitigate style amnesia. In addition, we examine various prompting strategies and find that SLMs struggle to follow the required style when the instruction is placed in system messages rather than user messages, which contradicts the intended function of system prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ef4\u6301\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u98ce\u683c\uff08\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u53e3\u97f3\u3001\u97f3\u91cf\u3001\u8bed\u901f\uff09\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\"\u98ce\u683c\u9057\u5fd8\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u80fd\u56de\u5fc6\u6307\u4ee4\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u8868\u8fbe\u98ce\u683c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u4fdd\u6301\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u98ce\u683c\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u526f\u8bed\u8a00\u98ce\u683c\uff08\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u53e3\u97f3\u7b49\uff09\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e863\u4e2a\u4e13\u6709\u548c2\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7ef4\u6301\u526f\u8bed\u8a00\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d88\u606fvs\u7528\u6237\u6d88\u606f\uff09\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u8981\u6c42\u56de\u5fc6\u98ce\u683c\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7ef4\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u56de\u5fc6\u98ce\u683c\u6307\u4ee4\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u8868\u8fbe\uff1b\u663e\u5f0f\u8981\u6c42\u56de\u5fc6\u80fd\u90e8\u5206\u7f13\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d88\u606f\u63d0\u793a\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u5982\u7528\u6237\u6d88\u606f\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e5f\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u3002"}}

Existing approaches suffer from three fundamental challenges: expensive human annotation for high-quality trajectories, poor generalization to unseen tools, and quality ceilings inherent in single-model synthesis that perpetuate biases and coverage gaps. We introduce InfTool, a fully autonomous framework that breaks these barriers through self-evolving multi-agent synthesis. Given only raw API specifications, InfTool orchestrates three collaborative agents (User Simulator, Tool-Calling Assistant, and MCP Server) to generate diverse, verified trajectories spanning single-turn calls to complex multi-step workflows. The framework establishes a closed loop: synthesized data trains the model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with gated rewards, the improved model generates higher-quality data targeting capability gaps, and this cycle iterates without human intervention. Experiments on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) demonstrate that InfTool transforms a base 32B model from 19.8% to 70.9% accuracy (+258%), surpassing models 10x larger and rivaling Claude-Opus, and entirely from synthetic data without human annotation.", "AI": {"tldr": "InfTool\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5c0632B\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece19.8%\u63d0\u5347\u523070.9%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8f68\u8ff9\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u9650\u5bfc\u81f4\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u7a81\u7834\u8fd9\u4e9b\u969c\u788d\u3002", "method": "InfTool\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u534f\u4f5c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff1a\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u52a9\u624b\u548cMCP\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u3002\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbAPI\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4ece\u5355\u6b21\u8c03\u7528\u5230\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6b65\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u5faa\u73af\uff1a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u901a\u8fc7\u5e26\u95e8\u63a7\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u9488\u5bf9\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u8fed\u4ee3\u5faa\u73af\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f2f\u514b\u5229\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u7528\u6392\u884c\u699c\u4e0a\uff0cInfTool\u5c0632B\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece19.8%\u63d0\u5347\u523070.9%\uff08+258%\uff09\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e8610\u500d\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0eClaude-Opus\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\uff0c\u4e14\u5b8c\u5168\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "conclusion": "InfTool\u901a\u8fc7\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u539f\u59cbAPI\u89c4\u8303\u5230\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7a81\u7834\u3002"}}

Generally, consumers use overly descriptive and peripheral information to express their medical condition or other healthcare needs, contributing to the challenges of natural language understanding. One way to address this challenge is to summarize the questions and distill the key information of the original question. Recently, large-scale datasets have significantly propelled the development of several summarization tasks, such as multi-document summarization and dialogue summarization. However, a lack of a domain-expert annotated dataset for the consumer healthcare questions summarization task inhibits the development of an efficient summarization system. To address this issue, we introduce a new dataset, CHQ-Sum,m that contains 1507 domain-expert annotated consumer health questions and corresponding summaries. The dataset is derived from the community question answering forum and therefore provides a valuable resource for understanding consumer health-related posts on social media. We benchmark the dataset on multiple state-of-the-art summarization models to show the effectiveness of the dataset", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86CHQ-Sum\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b1507\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5065\u5eb7\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u6458\u8981\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5065\u5eb7\u95ee\u9898\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u4e1a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u5bfb\u6c42\u5065\u5eb7\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u8fc7\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u548c\u5916\u56f4\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u8868\u8fbe\u533b\u7597\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u8fd9\u7ed9\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5065\u5eb7\u95ee\u9898\u6458\u8981\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u6458\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86CHQ-Sum\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b1507\u4e2a\u4ece\u793e\u533a\u95ee\u7b54\u8bba\u575b\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5065\u5eb7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u6458\u8981\u3002\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5065\u5eb7\u76f8\u5173\u5e16\u5b50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9d\u8d35\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6458\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5bf9CHQ-Sum\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5065\u5eb7\u95ee\u9898\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "CHQ-Sum\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5065\u5eb7\u95ee\u9898\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u4e1a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5065\u5eb7\u4fe1\u606f\u6458\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u76f8\u5173\u5185\u5bb9\u3002"}}

While full browser interaction could unlock deeper capabilities, its fine-grained control and verbose page content returns introduce substantial complexity for ReAct-style function-calling agents. To bridge this gap, we propose Nested Browser-Use Learning (NestBrowse), which introduces a minimal and complete browser-action framework that decouples interaction control from page exploration through a nested structure. This design simplifies agentic reasoning while enabling effective deep-web information acquisition. Empirical results on challenging deep IS benchmarks demonstrate that NestBrowse offers clear benefits in practice.

Data and code available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/prdeepakbabu/ProfASR-Bench https://github.com/prdeepakbabu/ProfASR-Bench", "summary": "Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in professional settings faces challenges that existing benchmarks underplay: dense domain terminology, formal register variation, and near-zero tolerance for critical entity errors. We present ProfASR-Bench, a professional-talk evaluation suite for high-stakes applications across finance, medicine, legal, and technology. Each example pairs a natural-language prompt (domain cue and/or speaker profile) with an entity-rich target utterance, enabling controlled measurement of context-conditioned recognition. The corpus supports conventional ASR metrics alongside entity-aware scores and slice-wise reporting by accent and gender. Using representative families Whisper (encoder-decoder ASR) and Qwen-Omni (audio language models) under matched no-context, profile, domain+profile, oracle, and adversarial conditions, we find a consistent pattern: lightweight textual context produces little to no change in average word error rate (WER), even with oracle prompts, and adversarial prompts do not reliably degrade performance. We term this the context-utilization gap (CUG): current systems are nominally promptable yet underuse readily available side information. ProfASR-Bench provides a standardized context ladder, entity- and slice-aware reporting with confidence intervals, and a reproducible testbed for comparing fusion strategies across model families.\n  Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/prdeepakbabu/ProfASR-Bench\n  Code: https://github.com/prdeepakbabu/ProfASR-Bench", "AI": {"tldr": "ProfASR-Bench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57dfASR\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\"\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5229\u7528\u5dee\u8ddd\"\u2014\u2014\u5373\u4f7f\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u4fe1\u606f\u4e5f\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ASR\u57fa\u51c6\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e13\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5bc6\u96c6\u9886\u57df\u672f\u8bed\u3001\u6b63\u5f0f\u8bed\u4f53\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u5173\u952e\u5b9e\u4f53\u96f6\u5bb9\u5fcd\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5957\u4ef6\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u6784\u5efaProfASR-Bench\u4e13\u4e1a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u533b\u7597\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u3001\u6280\u672f\u9886\u57df\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u9886\u57df\u7ebf\u7d22/\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8bdd\u8bed\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Whisper\u548cQwen-Omni\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u4e2a\u4eba\u8d44\u6599\u3001\u9886\u57df+\u4e2a\u4eba\u8d44\u6599\u3001\u7406\u60f3\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u63d0\u793a\u7b49\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6d4b\u8bd5", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u5e73\u5747\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u7406\u60f3\u63d0\u793a\uff1b\u5bf9\u6297\u63d0\u793a\u4e5f\u672a\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\"\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5229\u7528\u5dee\u8ddd\"\u2014\u2014\u5f53\u524d\u7cfb\u7edf\u540d\u4e49\u4e0a\u53ef\u63d0\u793a\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u7528\u4fe1\u606f", "conclusion": "ProfASR-Bench\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9636\u68af\u3001\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u5207\u7247\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u62a5\u544a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dASR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027"}}

Given a model response, an annotator provides fine-grained feedback by marking ``liked'' and ``disliked'' spans and specifying what they liked or disliked about them. The base model then rewrites the disliked spans accordingly, proceeding from left to right, forming a sequence of incremental improvements. We construct preference pairs for direct alignment from each adjacent step in the chain, enabling the model to learn from localized, targeted edits. We find that our approach outperforms direct alignment methods based on standard A/B preference ranking or full contrastive rewrites, demonstrating that structured, revision-based supervision leads to more efficient and effective preference tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u6539\u8fdb\u94fe\u7684\u504f\u597d\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u6539\u5199\u6784\u5efa\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfA/B\u504f\u597d\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982A/B\u504f\u597d\u6392\u5e8f\u6216\u5b8c\u6574\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6539\u5199\uff09\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fee\u8ba2\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u6765\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u504f\u597d\u8c03\u4f18", "method": "1) \u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u6807\u8bb0\"\u559c\u6b22\"\u548c\"\u4e0d\u559c\u6b22\"\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7247\u6bb5\uff1b2) \u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u5de6\u5230\u53f3\u9010\u6b65\u6539\u5199\"\u4e0d\u559c\u6b22\"\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u589e\u91cf\u6539\u8fdb\u94fe\uff1b3) \u4ece\u94fe\u4e2d\u76f8\u90bb\u6b65\u9aa4\u6784\u5efa\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u9f50", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6A/B\u504f\u597d\u6392\u5e8f\u6216\u5b8c\u6574\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6539\u5199\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fee\u8ba2\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u504f\u597d\u8c03\u4f18", "conclusion": "\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u94fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u3001\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u597d\u76d1\u7763\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6"}}

Recent work proposes novel techniques to find natural language prompts that induce specific behaviors from a target model, yet they are mainly studied in single-turn settings. In this work, we study behavior elicitation in the context of multi-turn conversations. We first offer an analytical framework that categorizes existing methods into three families based on their interactions with the target model: those that use only prior knowledge, those that use offline interactions, and those that learn from online interactions. We then introduce a generalized multi-turn formulation of the online method, unifying single-turn and multi-turn elicitation. We evaluate all three families of methods on automatically generating multi-turn test cases. We investigate the efficiency of these approaches by analyzing the trade-off between the query budget, i.e., the number of interactions with the target model, and the success rate, i.e., the discovery rate of behavior-eliciting inputs. We find that online methods can achieve an average success rate of 45/19/77% with just a few thousand queries over three tasks where static methods from existing multi-turn conversation benchmarks find few or even no failure cases. Our work highlights a novel application of behavior elicitation methods in multi-turn conversation evaluation and the need for the community to move towards dynamic benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u591a\u8f6e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ee5\u8f83\u5c11\u67e5\u8be2\u83b7\u5f97\u8f83\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u884c\u4e3a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u66f4\u4e3a\u5e38\u89c1\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7279\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u7c7b\uff1a\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u4ece\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u5e7f\u4e49\u591a\u8f6e\u5728\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5355\u8f6e\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u8bf1\u5bfc\uff1b3) \u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u67e5\u8be2\u9884\u7b97\u4e0e\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523045%\u300119%\u300177%\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u51e0\u5343\u6b21\u67e5\u8be2\u3002\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u7684\u9759\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0\u5f88\u5c11\u751a\u81f3\u6ca1\u6709\u5931\u8d25\u6848\u4f8b\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5728\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u793e\u533a\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u8f6c\u5411\u52a8\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7f3a\u9677\u3002"}}
