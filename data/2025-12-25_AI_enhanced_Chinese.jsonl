Global route optimization for ETS in static 2D continuous environments remains largely underexplored due to the intractability of objective evaluation, stemming from the continuous nature of the environment and the interplay of motion and visibility constraints. Prior work has addressed this through partial discretization, leading to discrete-sensing formulations tackled via utility-greedy heuristics. Others have taken an indirect approach by heuristically approximating the objective using minimum latency problems on fixed graphs, enabling global route optimization via efficient metaheuristics. This paper builds on and significantly extends the latter by introducing Milaps (Minimum latency problems), a model-based solution framework for ETS. Milaps integrates novel auxiliary objectives and adapts a recent anytime metaheuristic for the traveling deliveryman problem, chosen for its strong performance under tight runtime constraints. Evaluations on a novel large-scale dataset demonstrate superior trade-offs between solution quality and runtime compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The best-performing strategy rapidly generates a preliminary solution, assigns static weights to sensing configurations, and optimizes global costs metaheuristically. Additionally, a qualitative study highlights the framework's flexibility across diverse scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMilaps\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u89e3\u51b3\u9884\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u79fb\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u79fb\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\uff08ETS\uff09\u662f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9759\u60012D\u8fde\u7eed\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5316\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u91c7\u7528\u90e8\u5206\u79bb\u6563\u5316\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u95f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMilaps\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21ETS\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u65b0\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u65c5\u884c\u9001\u8d27\u5458\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u4e25\u683c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cMilaps\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u521d\u6b65\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5\u914d\u7f6e\u5206\u914d\u9759\u6001\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u5168\u5c40\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "Milaps\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aETS\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Accepted to IEEE Aerospace Conference 2026", "summary": "This paper presents a general purpose framework for autonomous, vision-based interception of dynamic, non-cooperative targets, validated across three distinct mobility platforms: an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a four-wheeled ground rover, and an air-thruster spacecraft testbed. The approach relies solely on a monocular camera with fiducials for target tracking and operates entirely in the local observer frame without the need for global information. The core contribution of this work is a streamlined and general approach to autonomous interception that can be adapted across robots with varying dynamics, as well as our comprehensive study of the robot interception problem across heterogenous mobility systems under limited observability and no global localization. Our method integrates (1) an Extended Kalman Filter for relative pose estimation amid intermittent measurements, (2) a history-conditioned motion predictor for dynamic target trajectory propagation, and (3) a receding-horizon planner solving a constrained convex program in real time to ensure time-efficient and kinematically feasible interception paths. Our operating regime assumes that observability is restricted by partial fields of view, sensor dropouts, and target occlusions. Experiments are performed in these conditions and include autonomous UAV landing on dynamic targets, rover rendezvous and leader-follower tasks, and spacecraft proximity operations. Results from simulated and physical experiments demonstrate robust performance with low interception errors (both during station-keeping and upon scenario completion), high success rates under deterministic and stochastic target motion profiles, and real-time execution on embedded processors such as the Jetson Orin, VOXL2, and Raspberry Pi 5.

Incremental damage can make such control fragile. This tends to go unnoticed until a small perturbation induces instability (i.e. loss of control). Traditional methods in the field of engineering rely on accurate system models to compute a safe set of operating instructions, which become invalid when the, possibly damaged, system diverges from its model. Here we demonstrate that the approach of such a feedback system towards instability can nonetheless be monitored through dynamical indicators of resilience. This holistic system safety monitor does not rely on a system model and is based on the generic phenomenon of critical slowing down, shown to occur in the climate, biology and other complex nonlinear systems approaching criticality. Our findings for engineered devices opens up a wide range of applications involving real-time early warning systems as well as an empirical guidance of resilient system design exploration, or \"tinkering\". While we demonstrate the validity using drones, the generic nature of the underlying principles suggest that these indicators could apply across a wider class of controlled systems including reactors, aircraft, and self-driving cars.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e34\u754c\u51cf\u901f\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u76d1\u6d4b\u53cd\u9988\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u3001\u53cd\u5e94\u5806\u3001\u98de\u673a\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u7b49\u5404\u7c7b\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cbe\u786e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b89\u5168\u64cd\u4f5c\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d7\u635f\u504f\u79bb\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u6548\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9010\u6e10\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u5f15\u53d1\u5931\u63a7\u624d\u88ab\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e34\u754c\u51cf\u901f\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u6307\u6807\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6574\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u6d4b\u5668\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u901a\u7528\u73b0\u8c61\u6765\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6307\u6807\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5f39\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5176\u901a\u7528\u539f\u7406\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u53cd\u5e94\u5806\u3001\u98de\u673a\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

These benchmarks provide useful aggregated metrics for a given capability, but those aggregated metrics can obscure (i) particular sub-areas where the LLMs are weak (\"model gaps\") and (ii) imbalanced coverage in the benchmarks themselves (\"benchmark gaps\"). We propose a new method that uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to automatically uncover both types of gaps. By extracting SAE concept activations and computing saliency-weighted performance scores across benchmark data, the method grounds evaluation in the model's internal representations and enables comparison across benchmarks. As examples demonstrating our approach, we applied the method to two popular open-source models and ten benchmarks. We found that these models consistently underperformed on concepts that stand in contrast to sycophantic behaviors (e.g., politely refusing a request or asserting boundaries) and concepts connected to safety discussions. These model gaps align with observations previously surfaced in the literature; our automated, unsupervised method was able to recover them without manual supervision. We also observed benchmark gaps: many of the evaluated benchmarks over-represented concepts related to obedience, authority, or instruction-following, while missing core concepts that should fall within their intended scope. In sum, our method offers a representation-grounded approach to evaluation, enabling concept-level decomposition of benchmark scores. Rather than replacing conventional aggregated metrics, CG complements them by providing a concept-level decomposition that can reveal why a model scored as it did and how benchmarks could evolve to better reflect their intended scope.

In particular, since Vision Language Models (VLMs) do not include low-level motion information from robots in their training datasets, video understanding including trajectory information remains a significant challenge. In this study, we assess two capabilities of VLMs through a video captioning task with low-level robot motion information: (1) automatic captioning of robot tasks and (2) segmentation of a series of tasks. Both capabilities are expected to enhance the efficiency of robot imitation learning by linking language and motion and serve as a measure of the foundation model's performance. The proposed method generates multiple \"scene\" captions using image captions and trajectory data from robot tasks. The full task caption is then generated by summarizing these individual captions. Additionally, the method performs subtask segmentation by comparing the similarity between text embeddings of image captions. In both captioning tasks, the proposed method aims to improve performance by providing the robot's motion data - joint and end-effector states - as input to the VLM.

We introduce SA-DiffuSeq, a diffusion framework that integrates sparse attention to fundamentally improve scalability for long document modeling. By selectively allocating attention within the diffusion process, SA-DiffuSeq significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining semantic coherence and generation quality. A key component of our method is a soft absorbing state tailored to sparse attention dynamics, which stabilizes diffusion trajectories and accelerates sequence reconstruction. This design improves sampling efficiency and enhances precision in long range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA-DiffuSeq consistently surpasses state of the art diffusion baselines in both training efficiency and sampling speed, with especially strong gains on extended sequences. These properties make SA-DiffuSeq well suited for demanding long form applications such as scientific writing, large scale code generation, and multi turn long context dialogue.

Discrete sensing strategies, including sensor arrays and distributed sensors, are broadly involved in tactile sensors across versatile applications. However, it remains a challenge to achieve high spatial resolution with self-decoupled capacity and insensitivity to other off-axis stimuli for stretchable tactile sensors. Herein, we develop a stretchable tactile sensor based on the proposed continuous spectral-filtering principle, allowing superhigh resolution for applied stimuli. This proposed sensor enables a high-linear spatial response (0.996) even during stretching and bending, and high continuous spatial (7 \u03bcm) and force (5 mN) resolutions with design scalability and interaction robustness to survive piercing and cutting.

Existing methods for this alignment task rely on abundant satellites unavailable in GNSS-degraded environments, or use local optimization methods which cannot guarantee the optimality of a solution. This work introduces a globally optimal solver that transforms raw pseudo-range or Doppler measurements into a convexly relaxed problem. The proposed method is certifiable, meaning it can numerically verify the correctness of the result, filling a gap where existing local optimizers fail. We first formulate the original frame alignment problem as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) problem and relax the QCQP problem to a concave Lagrangian dual problem that provides a lower cost bound for the original problem. Then we perform relaxation tightness and observability analysis to derive criteria for certifiable optimality of the solution. Finally, simulation and real world experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The experiments show that our method provides certifiably optimal solutions even with only 2 satellites with Doppler measurements and 2D vehicle motion, while the traditional velocity-based VOBA method and the advanced GVINS alignment technique may fail or converge to local optima without notice.

A key property of effective simulators is their ability to expose failure modes of the systems they evaluate. We present an adversarial training framework that iteratively improves user simulator realism through a competitive dynamic between a generator (user simulator) and a discriminator. Applied to mental health support chatbots, our approach demonstrates that fine-tuned simulators dramatically outperform zero-shot base models at surfacing system issues, and adversarial training further enhances diversity, distributional alignment, and predictive validity. The resulting simulator achieves a strong correlation between simulated and real failure occurrence rates across diverse chatbot configurations while maintaining low distributional divergence of failure modes. Discriminator accuracy decreases drastically after three adversarial iterations, suggesting improved realism. These results provide evidence that adversarial training is a promising approach for creating realistic user simulators in mental health support TOD domains, enabling rapid, reliable, and cost-effective system evaluation before deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff09\u4e0e\u5224\u522b\u5668\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u52a8\u6001\u8fed\u4ee3\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u652f\u6301\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u521b\u5efa\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u590d\u5236\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u6027\u662f\u80fd\u591f\u66b4\u9732\u88ab\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff09\u4e0e\u5224\u522b\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u52a8\u6001\u8fed\u4ee3\u6539\u8fdb\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u652f\u6301\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5728\u66b4\u9732\u7cfb\u7edf\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6545\u969c\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4f4e\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u5224\u522b\u5668\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5728\u4e09\u6b21\u5bf9\u6297\u8fed\u4ee3\u540e\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u6539\u5584", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u521b\u5efa\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u5bf9\u8bdd\u9886\u57df\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u6709\u524d\u9014\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30"}}

While current graph-based methods offer an efficient, structured approach by abstracting the environment into a topological map and simplifying the action space to waypoint selection, they lag behind methods based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in leveraging large-scale data and advanced training paradigms. In this paper, we try to bridge this gap by introducing ETP-R1, a framework that applies the paradigm of scaling up data and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to a graph-based VLN-CE model. To build a strong foundation, we first construct a high-quality, large-scale pretraining dataset using the Gemini API. This dataset consists of diverse, low-hallucination instructions for topological trajectories, providing rich supervision for our graph-based policy to map language to topological paths. This foundation is further strengthened by unifying data from both R2R and RxR tasks for joint pretraining. Building on this, we introduce a three-stage training paradigm, which culminates in the first application of closed-loop, online RFT to a graph-based VLN-CE model, powered by the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is highly effective, establishing new state-of-the-art performance across all major metrics on both the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks.

We examine this question using a controlled, turn-level comparison in which expert human tutors, novice human tutors, and multiple large language models respond to the same set of math remediation conversation turns. We examine both instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics of tutoring responses, including restating and revoicing, pressing for accuracy, lexical diversity, readability, politeness, and agency. We find that large language models approach expert levels of perceived pedagogical quality on average but exhibit systematic differences in their instructional and linguistic profiles. In particular, large language models tend to underuse restating and revoicing strategies characteristic of expert human tutors, while producing longer, more lexically diverse, and more polite responses. Statistical analyses show that restating and revoicing, lexical diversity, and pressing for accuracy are positively associated with perceived pedagogical quality, whereas higher levels of agentic and polite language are negatively associated. Overall, recent large language models exhibit levels of perceived pedagogical quality comparable to expert human tutors, while relying on different instructional and linguistic strategies. These findings underscore the value of analyzing instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics when evaluating tutoring responses across human tutors and intelligent tutoring systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u4e2d\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f85\u5bfc\u5458\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5176\u6559\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b9e\u8df5\u6709\u591a\u63a5\u8fd1\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u9010\u8f6e\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f85\u5bfc\u5458\u5728\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u9010\u8f6e\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8ba9\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f85\u5bfc\u5458\u3001\u65b0\u624b\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f85\u5bfc\u5458\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u540c\u4e00\u7ec4\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6e\u6b21\u8fdb\u884c\u56de\u5e94\u3002\u5206\u6790\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u91cd\u8ff0\u3001\u590d\u8ff0\u3001\u8981\u6c42\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u3001\u793c\u8c8c\u6027\u3001\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u8f83\u5c11\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f85\u5bfc\u5458\u7279\u6709\u7684\u91cd\u8ff0\u548c\u590d\u8ff0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u957f\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u3001\u66f4\u793c\u8c8c\u7684\u56de\u5e94\u3002\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u91cd\u8ff0/\u590d\u8ff0\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8981\u6c42\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5bf9\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u6709\u6b63\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u793c\u8c8c\u8bed\u8a00\u5219\u6709\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd1\u671f\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u53ef\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f85\u5bfc\u5458\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f85\u5bfc\u5458\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

We conducted two comprehensive experiments (N = 1,038) examining how occupational contexts and stereotype activation shape robotic agent choices across construction, healthcare, educational, and athletic domains. Participants made selections from artificial agents that varied systematically in skin tone and anthropomorphic characteristics. Our study revealed distinct context-dependent patterns. Healthcare and educational scenarios demonstrated strong favoritism toward lighter-skinned artificial agents, while construction and athletic contexts showed greater acceptance of darker-toned alternatives. Participant race was associated with systematic differences in selection patterns across professional domains. The second experiment demonstrated that exposure to human professionals from specific racial backgrounds systematically shifted later robotic agent preferences in stereotype-consistent directions. These findings show that occupational biases and color-based discrimination transfer directly from human-human to human-robot evaluation contexts. The results highlight mechanisms through which robotic deployment may unintentionally perpetuate existing social inequalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u804c\u4e1a\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u80a4\u8272\u6b67\u89c6\u4ece\u4eba\u9645\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f4\u63a5\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u4eba\u673a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u804c\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80a4\u8272\u504f\u597d\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u878d\u5165\u4e13\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u804c\u4e1a\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u80a4\u8272\u6b67\u89c6\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u4ece\u4eba\u9645\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u4eba\u673a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e24\u9879\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08N=1038\uff09\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u804c\u4e1a\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5efa\u7b51\u3001\u533b\u7597\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u4f53\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u4ee3\u7406\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4ece\u80a4\u8272\u548c\u62df\u4eba\u7279\u5f81\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9", "result": "\u533b\u7597\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u660e\u663e\u504f\u7231\u6d45\u80a4\u8272\u4eba\u5de5\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u5efa\u7b51\u548c\u4f53\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u66f4\u63a5\u53d7\u6df1\u80a4\u8272\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\u3002\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u79cd\u65cf\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u63a5\u89e6\u7279\u5b9a\u79cd\u65cf\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6539\u53d8\u540e\u7eed\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ee3\u7406\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u65b9\u5411\u4e0e\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u4e00\u81f4", "conclusion": "\u804c\u4e1a\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u80a4\u8272\u6b67\u89c6\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u4eba\u9645\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u4eba\u673a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u5ef6\u7eed\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u80fd\u5f3a\u5316\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u673a\u5236"}}

In this work, we explore the editing algorithms ROME, IKE, and WISE and design new editing targets for an unlearning setting. Through this investigation, we show that model editing approaches can exceed baseline unlearning methods in terms of quality of forgetting depending on the setting.

We present a compact multimodal sensor that integrates high-resolution vision-based tactile imaging with a 6-axis force-torque sensor. In experiments on silicone phantoms with diverse subsurface tendon geometries, force signals alone frequently produce ambiguous responses, while tactile images reveal clear structural differences in presence, diameter, depth, crossings, and multiplicity. Yet accurate force tracking remains essential for maintaining safe, consistent contact during physiotherapeutic interaction. Preliminary results show that combining tactile and force modalities enables robust subsurface feature detection and controlled robotic palpation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u89e6\u89c9\u6210\u50cf\u4e0e\u516d\u8f74\u529b\u626d\u77e9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89e6\u8bca\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u8f6f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e0b\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u7279\u5f81", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89e6\u8bca\u4f9d\u8d56\u529b\u4f20\u611f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8f6f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u529b\u4fe1\u53f7\u53d8\u5316\u5927\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u76ae\u4e0b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c6\u89c9\u89e6\u89c9\u6210\u50cf\u4e0e6\u8f74\u529b\u626d\u77e9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u7845\u80f6\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u76ae\u4e0b\u808c\u8171\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784", "result": "\u529b\u4fe1\u53f7\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u7ecf\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u6a21\u7cca\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u89e6\u89c9\u56fe\u50cf\u80fd\u6e05\u6670\u663e\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\uff08\u5b58\u5728\u3001\u76f4\u5f84\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u4ea4\u53c9\u3001\u591a\u91cd\u6027\uff09\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u76ae\u4e0b\u7279\u5f81\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89e6\u8bca", "conclusion": "\u89e6\u89c9\u4e0e\u529b\u4f20\u611f\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89e6\u8bca\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ec6\u5fae\u76ae\u4e0b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u4e00\u81f4\u63a5\u89e6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u6cbb\u7597\u4ea4\u4e92\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Using a multi-task evaluation setup where demographics are associated with names, professions, and education levels, we measure whether models can be debiased while preserving demographic detection capabilities. We compare attribution-based and correlation-based methods for locating bias features. We find that targeted sparse autoencoder feature ablations in Gemma-2-9B reduce bias without degrading recognition performance: attribution-based ablations mitigate race and gender profession stereotypes while preserving name recognition accuracy, whereas correlation-based ablations are more effective for education bias. Qualitative analysis further reveals that removing attribution features in education tasks induces ``prior collapse'', thus increasing overall bias. This highlights the need for dimension-specific interventions. Overall, our results show that demographic bias arises from task-specific mechanisms rather than absolute demographic markers, and that mechanistic inference-time interventions can enable surgical debiasing without compromising core model capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u89c1\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u6d88\u878d\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u504f\u89c1\u7c7b\u578b\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u89c1\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u4e00\u822c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5426\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6d88\u9664\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08\u5c06\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0e\u59d3\u540d\u3001\u804c\u4e1a\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u6c34\u5e73\u5173\u8054\uff09\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u7279\u5f81\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u6d88\u878d\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6d88\u878d\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u79cd\u65cf\u548c\u6027\u522b\u804c\u4e1a\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u59d3\u540d\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u504f\u89c1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002\u79fb\u9664\u6559\u80b2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u7279\u5f81\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\"\u5148\u9a8c\u5d29\u6e83\"\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u603b\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u89c1\u6e90\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u800c\u975e\u7edd\u5bf9\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5236\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)", "summary": "Regulating grasping force to reduce slippage during dynamic object interaction remains a fundamental challenge in robotic manipulation, especially when objects are manipulated by multiple rolling contacts, have unknown properties (such as mass or surface conditions), and when external sensing is unreliable. In contrast, humans can quickly regulate grasping force by touch, even without visual cues. Inspired by this ability, we aim to enable robotic hands to rapidly explore objects and learn tactile-driven grasping force control under motion and limited sensing. We propose a physics-informed energy abstraction that models the object as a virtual energy container. The inconsistency between the fingers' applied power and the object's retained energy provides a physically grounded signal for inferring slip-aware stability. Building on this abstraction, we employ model-based learning and planning to efficiently model energy dynamics from tactile sensing and perform real-time grasping force optimization. Experiments in both simulation and hardware demonstrate that our method can learn grasping force control from scratch within minutes, effectively reduce slippage, and extend grasp duration across diverse motion-object pairs, all without relying on external sensing or prior object knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u80fd\u91cf\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u901a\u8fc7\u89e6\u89c9\u5b66\u4e60\u6293\u63e1\u529b\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u4f20\u611f\u6216\u7269\u4f53\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u51e0\u5206\u949f\u5185\u5c31\u80fd\u5b66\u4f1a\u51cf\u5c11\u6ed1\u52a8", "motivation": "\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u8c03\u8282\u6293\u63e1\u529b\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u6ed1\u52a8\u662f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u7269\u4f53\u88ab\u591a\u4e2a\u6eda\u52a8\u63a5\u89e6\u64cd\u7eb5\u3001\u5177\u6709\u672a\u77e5\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u8d28\u91cf\u6216\u8868\u9762\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\u4e14\u5916\u90e8\u4f20\u611f\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u65f6\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ec5\u51ed\u89e6\u89c9\u5c31\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u8c03\u8282\u6293\u63e1\u529b\uff0c\u53d7\u6b64\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u8ba9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u4e5f\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u89e6\u89c9\u5b66\u4e60\u6293\u63e1\u529b\u63a7\u5236", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u91cf\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u5c06\u7269\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u865a\u62df\u80fd\u91cf\u5bb9\u5668\u3002\u624b\u6307\u65bd\u52a0\u529f\u7387\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u4fdd\u7559\u80fd\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u63a8\u65ad\u6ed1\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4ece\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u9ad8\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u91cf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6293\u63e1\u529b\u4f18\u5316", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u51e0\u5206\u949f\u5185\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u5b66\u4e60\u6293\u63e1\u529b\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u6ed1\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u8fd0\u52a8-\u7269\u4f53\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5ef6\u957f\u6293\u63e1\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u4f20\u611f\u6216\u7269\u4f53\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u91cf\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u89e6\u89c9\u5feb\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u6293\u63e1\u529b\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u9632\u6b62\u6ed1\u52a8\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

We investigate the so-called reasoning capabilities of LLMs over novel symbolic representations by introducing an experimental framework that tests their ability to process and manipulate unfamiliar symbols. We introduce semantic deceptions: situations in which symbols carry misleading semantic associations due to their form, such as being embedded in specific contexts, designed to probe whether LLMs can maintain symbolic abstraction or whether they default to exploiting learned semantic associations. We redefine standard digits and mathematical operators using novel symbols, and task LLMs with solving simple calculations expressed in this altered notation. The objective is: (1) to assess LLMs' capacity for abstraction and manipulation of arbitrary symbol systems; (2) to evaluate their ability to resist misleading semantic cues that conflict with the task's symbolic logic. Through experiments with four LLMs we show that semantic cues can significantly deteriorate reasoning models' performance on very simple tasks. They reveal limitations in current LLMs' ability for symbolic manipulations and highlight a tendency to over-rely on surface-level semantics, suggesting that chain-of-thoughts may amplify reliance on statistical correlations. Even in situations where LLMs seem to correctly follow instructions, semantic cues still impact basic capabilities. These limitations raise ethical and societal concerns, undermining the widespread and pernicious tendency to attribute reasoning abilities to LLMs and suggesting how LLMs might fail, in particular in decision-making contexts where robust symbolic reasoning is essential and should not be compromised by residual semantic associations inherited from the model's training.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u8bed\u4e49\u6b3a\u9a97\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e5f\u4f1a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u8bed\u4e49\u800c\u975e\u62bd\u8c61\u7b26\u53f7\u903b\u8f91", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b83\u4eec\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5177\u5907\u62bd\u8c61\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u6b3a\u9a97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u6570\u5b57\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u8fd0\u7b97\u7b26\u4e3a\u65b0\u9896\u7b26\u53f7\uff0c\u8ba9LLMs\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u79cd\u6539\u53d8\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b83\u4eec\u62b5\u6297\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u80fd\u529b", "result": "\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eLLMs\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u53ef\u80fd\u653e\u5927\u7edf\u8ba1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56", "conclusion": "LLMs\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u8bed\u4e49\u6b3a\u9a97\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u8d28\u7591\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8eLLMs\u7684\u666e\u904d\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7a33\u5065\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u573a\u666f\u4e2d"}}

Recent researches have increasingly explored language-guided manipulation, where robots not only perceive the scene but also interpret task-relevant natural language instructions. However, existing language-conditioned grasping methods typically rely on shallow fusion strategies, leading to limited semantic grounding and weak alignment between linguistic intent and visual grasp reasoning.In this work, we propose Language-Guided Grasp Detection (LGGD) with a coarse-to-fine learning paradigm for robotic manipulation. LGGD leverages CLIP-based visual and textual embeddings within a hierarchical cross-modal fusion pipeline, progressively injecting linguistic cues into the visual feature reconstruction process. This design enables fine-grained visual-semantic alignment and improves the feasibility of the predicted grasps with respect to task instructions. In addition, we introduce a language-conditioned dynamic convolution head (LDCH) that mixes multiple convolution experts based on sentence-level features, enabling instruction-adaptive coarse mask and grasp predictions. A final refinement module further enhances grasp consistency and robustness in complex scenes.Experiments on the OCID-VLG and Grasp-Anything++ datasets show that LGGD surpasses existing language-guided grasping methods, exhibiting strong generalization to unseen objects and diverse language queries. Moreover, deployment on a real robotic platform demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach in executing accurate, instruction-conditioned grasp actions. The code will be released publicly upon acceptance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLGGD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6293\u53d6\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5229\u7528CLIP\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6293\u53d6\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u6293\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u6d45\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u6293\u53d6\u63a8\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f83\u5f31\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u6742\u4e71\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLGGD\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5229\u7528CLIP\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u7ebf\u7d22\u6ce8\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u52a8\u6001\u5377\u79ef\u5934(LDCH)\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u6df7\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u5377\u79ef\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6307\u4ee4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u7c97\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u6293\u53d6\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b3) \u6700\u7ec8\u7ec6\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3a\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728OCID-VLG\u548cGrasp-Anything++\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u6293\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u7269\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u6837\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LGGD\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u6293\u53d6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

In this work, we study a lightweight 2-degree-of-freedom (DoF) arm mounted on a quadrotor via a differential mechanism, capable of full six-DoF end-effector pose control. While the minimal design enables simplicity and reduced payload, it also introduces challenges such as underactuation and sensitivity to external disturbances, including manipulation of heavy loads and pushing tasks. To address these, we employ reinforcement learning, training a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent in simulation to generate feedforward commands for quadrotor acceleration and body rates, along with joint angle targets.

Existing evaluations either test factual medical knowledge in isolation or assess patient-level reasoning without verifying correctness, leaving a critical gap. We introduce MediEval, a benchmark that links MIMIC-IV electronic health records (EHRs) to a unified knowledge base built from UMLS and other biomedical vocabularies. MediEval generates diverse factual and counterfactual medical statements within real patient contexts, enabling systematic evaluation across a 4-quadrant framework that jointly considers knowledge grounding and contextual consistency. Using this framework, we identify critical failure modes, including hallucinated support and truth inversion, that current proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific LLMs frequently exhibit. To address these risks, we propose Counterfactual Risk-Aware Fine-tuning (CoRFu), a DPO-based method with an asymmetric penalty targeting unsafe confusions. CoRFu improves by +16.4 macro-F1 points over the base model and eliminates truth inversion errors, demonstrating both higher accuracy and substantially greater safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "MediEval\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CoRFu\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u53cd\u8f6c\u7b49\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u5230\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u62c5\u5fe7\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u8981\u4e48\u5b64\u7acb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8bc4\u4f30\u60a3\u8005\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u800c\u4e0d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002", "method": "1) \u5f15\u5165MediEval\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5c06MIMIC-IV\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0eUMLS\u7b49\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u8fde\u63a5\uff1b2) \u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u60a3\u8005\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u533b\u5b66\u9648\u8ff0\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u75284\u8c61\u9650\u6846\u67b6\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b4) \u63d0\u51faCoRFu\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eDPO\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u60e9\u7f5a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u4e13\u6709\u3001\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9aLLM\u9891\u7e41\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5e7b\u89c9\u652f\u6301\u548c\u771f\u76f8\u53cd\u8f6c\u3002CoRFu\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86+16.4\u5b8fF1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u771f\u76f8\u53cd\u8f6c\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MediEval\u57fa\u51c6\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u533b\u7597LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u800cCoRFu\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11LLM\u5728\u533b\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

One common way it is applied in practice is through Model Predictive Control (MPC), which uses repeated rollouts of the simulator to optimize future actions and generate responsive control policies in real time. To make this process more accessible, the open source library MuJoCo MPC (MJPC) provides ready-to-use MPC algorithms and implementations built directly on top of the MuJoCo simulator. However, MJPC relies on finite differencing (FD) to compute derivatives through the underlying MuJoCo simulator, which is often a key bottleneck that can make it prohibitively costly for time-sensitive tasks, especially in high-DOF systems or complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce the use of Web of Affine Spaces (WASP) derivatives within MJPC as a drop-in replacement for FD. WASP is a recently developed approach for efficiently computing sequences of accurate derivative approximations. By reusing information from prior, related derivative calculations, WASP accelerates and stabilizes the computation of new derivatives, making it especially well suited for MPC's iterative, fine-grained updates over time. We evaluate WASP across a diverse suite of MJPC tasks spanning multiple robot embodiments. Our results suggest that WASP derivatives are particularly effective in MJPC: it integrates seamlessly across tasks, delivers consistently robust performance, and achieves up to a 2$\\mathsf{x}$ speedup compared to an FD backend when used with derivative-based planners, such as iLQG. In addition, WASP-based MPC outperforms MJPC's stochastic sampling-based planners on our evaluation tasks, offering both greater efficiency and reliability. To support adoption and future research, we release an open-source implementation of MJPC with WASP derivatives fully integrated.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06WASP\u5bfc\u6570\u96c6\u6210\u5230MuJoCo MPC\u4e2d\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe2\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347MPC\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "MuJoCo MPC\uff08MJPC\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bfc\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6210\u4e3a\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6216\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8", "method": "\u5c06Web of Affine Spaces\uff08WASP\uff09\u5bfc\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u96c6\u6210\u5230MJPC\u4e2d\uff0cWASP\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7528\u5148\u524d\u76f8\u5173\u5bfc\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u65b0\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97", "result": "WASP\u5728\u591a\u79cdMJPC\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1a\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u540e\u7aef\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff08\u5982iLQG\uff09\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe2\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8eMJPC\u7684\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u89c4\u5212\u5668", "conclusion": "WASP\u5bfc\u6570\u662fMJPC\u7684\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u96c6\u6210WASP\u7684MJPC\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u91c7\u7528\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76"}}

However, efficiently modeling the dynamic interactions between numerous road users and infrastructures in complex scenes remains an open problem. Existing methods typically employ distance-based or fully connected dense graph structures to capture interaction information, which not only introduces a large number of redundant edges but also requires complex and heavily parameterized networks for encoding, thereby resulting in low training and inference efficiency, limiting scalability to large and complex traffic scenes. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose SparScene, a sparse graph learning framework designed for efficient and scalable traffic scene representation. Instead of relying on distance thresholds, SparScene leverages the lane graph topology to construct structure-aware sparse connections between agents and lanes, enabling efficient yet informative scene graph representation. SparScene adopts a lightweight graph encoder that efficiently aggregates agent-map and agent-agent interactions, yielding compact scene representations with substantially improved efficiency and scalability. On the motion prediction benchmark of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), SparScene achieves competitive performance with remarkable efficiency. It generates trajectories for more than 200 agents in a scene within 5 ms and scales to more than 5,000 agents and 17,000 lanes with merely 54 ms of inference time with a GPU memory of 2.9 GB, highlighting its superior scalability for large-scale traffic scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "SparScene\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f66\u9053\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u6784\u5efa\u7a00\u758f\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u5728Waymo\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u57285ms\u5185\u5904\u7406200+\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u52305000+\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ec5\u970054ms\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u662f\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u6216\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u6355\u6349\u4ea4\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u5927\u91cf\u5197\u4f59\u8fb9\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u7e41\u591a\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSparScene\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8f66\u9053\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u8fde\u63a5\uff08\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ddd\u79bb\u9608\u503c\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u8f66\u9053\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u805a\u5408\u667a\u80fd\u4f53-\u5730\u56fe\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53-\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728Waymo Open Motion Dataset\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSparScene\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\uff1a\u57285ms\u5185\u4e3a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d200\u591a\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u52305000\u591a\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c17000\u6761\u8f66\u9053\uff0c\u4ec5\u970054ms\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u548c2.9GB GPU\u5185\u5b58\u3002", "conclusion": "SparScene\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We also introduce a simple retrieval quality measure that performs well without requiring knowledge of the total number of relevant documents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u77e5\u9053\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u6863\u603b\u6570\u7684\u65b0\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u68c0\u7d22\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d", "motivation": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u68c0\u7d22\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u4e14\u4e0d\u65ad\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4f7f\u5f97\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u6863\u603b\u6570\u901a\u5e38\u672a\u77e5\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u9650\u5236", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u5224\u65ad\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u65b0\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u77e5\u9053\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u6863\u603b\u6570", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u6863\u65702-15\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u6863\u603b\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u68c0\u7d22\u573a\u666f"}}

We present a bio-inspired 3D flocking algorithm in which each drone interacts only with a minimal set of influential neighbors, relying solely on local alignment and attraction cues. By systematically tuning these two interaction gains, we map a phase diagram revealing sharp transitions between swarming and schooling, as well as a critical region where susceptibility, polarization fluctuations, and reorganization capacity peak. Outdoor experiments with a swarm of ten drones, combined with simulations using a calibrated flight-dynamics model, show that operating near this transition enhances responsiveness to external disturbances. When confronted with an intruder, the swarm performs rapid collective turns, transient expansions, and reliably recovers high alignment within seconds. These results demonstrate that minimal local-interaction rules are sufficient to generate multiple collective phases and that simple gain modulation offers an efficient mechanism to adjust stability, flexibility, and resilience in drone swarms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u7269\u7fa4\u4f53\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u96c6\u7fa43D\u7f16\u961f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c40\u90e8\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5438\u5f15\u4e24\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u589e\u76ca\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u96c6\u7fa4\u72b6\u6001\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u533a\u57df\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u52a8\u7269\u7fa4\u4f53\u96c6\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u96c6\u7fa4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u539f\u5219\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c4\u5219\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u76843D\u96c6\u7fa4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4ec5\u4e0e\u5c11\u91cf\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u90bb\u5c45\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u90e8\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5438\u5f15\u4e24\u79cd\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u8282\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u7ed8\u5236\u76f8\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u96c6\u4f53\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u5ba4\u591610\u67b6\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u98de\u884c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u4eff\u771f\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u56fe\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u96c6\u7fa4\u548c\u7f16\u961f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6025\u5267\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e34\u754c\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5728\u8be5\u533a\u57df\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u6781\u5316\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u91cd\u7ec4\u80fd\u529b\u8fbe\u5230\u5cf0\u503c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u533a\u57df\u9644\u8fd1\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u3002\u9762\u5bf9\u5165\u4fb5\u8005\u65f6\uff0c\u96c6\u7fa4\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u96c6\u4f53\u8f6c\u5411\u3001\u77ac\u65f6\u6269\u5f20\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6570\u79d2\u5185\u6062\u590d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6700\u5c0f\u5c40\u90e8\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c4\u5219\u8db3\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u79cd\u96c6\u4f53\u76f8\u6001\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u589e\u76ca\u8c03\u8282\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u96c6\u7fa4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8c03\u6574\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u97e7\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u96c6\u7fa4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u800c\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

These models deliver strong agentic, reasoning, and conversational capabilities. The Nemotron 3 family uses a Mixture-of-Experts hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture to provide best-in-class throughput and context lengths of up to 1M tokens. Super and Ultra models are trained with NVFP4 and incorporate LatentMoE, a novel approach that improves model quality. The two larger models also include MTP layers for faster text generation. All Nemotron 3 models are post-trained using multi-environment reinforcement learning enabling reasoning, multi-step tool use, and support granular reasoning budget control. Nano, the smallest model, outperforms comparable models in accuracy while remaining extremely cost-efficient for inference.

However, existing ZSON methods often struggle in realistic and cluttered environments, particularly when the scene contains heavy occlusions, unknown risks, or dynamically moving target objects. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{Schr\u00f6dinger's Navigator}, a navigation framework inspired by Schr\u00f6dinger's thought experiment on uncertainty. The framework treats unobserved space as a set of plausible future worlds and reasons over them before acting. Conditioned on egocentric visual inputs and three candidate trajectories, a trajectory-conditioned 3D world model imagines future observations along each path. This enables the agent to see beyond occlusions and anticipate risks in unseen regions without requiring extra detours or dense global mapping. The imagined 3D observations are fused into the navigation map and used to update a value map. These updates guide the policy toward trajectories that avoid occlusions, reduce exposure to uncertain space, and better track moving targets. Experiments on a Go2 quadruped robot across three challenging scenarios, including severe static occlusions, unknown risks, and dynamically moving targets, show that Schr\u00f6dinger's Navigator consistently outperforms strong ZSON baselines in self-localization, object localization, and overall Success Rate in occlusion-heavy environments. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of trajectory-conditioned 3D imagination in enabling robust zero-shot object navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSchr\u00f6dinger's Navigator\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u8ff9\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u76843D\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u60f3\u8c61\u672a\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7269\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\u5728\u906e\u6321\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7269\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u906e\u6321\u3001\u672a\u77e5\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u79fb\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u89c2\u5bdf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u601d\u60f3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5c06\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ec4\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u672a\u6765\u4e16\u754c\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u5019\u9009\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f68\u8ff9\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u76843D\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u60f3\u8c61\u6bcf\u6761\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u672a\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5230\u5bfc\u822a\u5730\u56fe\u4e2d\u66f4\u65b0\u4ef7\u503c\u56fe\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u51cf\u5c11\u906e\u6321\u66b4\u9732\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u8ddf\u8e2a\u52a8\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728Go2\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\uff08\u4e25\u91cd\u9759\u6001\u906e\u6321\u3001\u672a\u77e5\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u79fb\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\uff09\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSchr\u00f6dinger's Navigator\u5728\u81ea\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u603b\u4f53\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5bfc\u822a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f68\u8ff9\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u76843D\u60f3\u8c61\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7269\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u906e\u6321\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We compare models using test negative log-likelihood (NLL), parameter count, and approximate training FLOPs to characterize accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our results show that attention-based models dominate MLPs in per-FLOP efficiency even at small scale, while increasing depth or context without sufficient optimization can degrade performance.

Traditional tethered sensor configurations often restrict joint movement and introduce mechanical noises. This study proposes a wireless embedded balance system designed to maintain stability on uneven surfaces. The system utilizes a custom-designed foot unit integrated with four load cells and an ESP32-C3 microcontroller to estimate the Center of Pressure (CoP) in real time. The CoP data were transmitted wirelessly to the main controller to minimize the wiring complexity of the 29-DoF VI-ROSE humanoid robot. A PID control strategy is implemented to adjust the torso, hip, and ankle roll joints based on CoP feedback. Experimental characterization demonstrated high sensor precision with an average measurement error of 14.8 g. Furthermore, the proposed control system achieved a 100% success rate in maintaining balance during single-leg lifting tasks at a 3-degree inclination with optimized PID parameters (Kp=0.10, Kd=0.005).

Tracing Provenance in LLM Reasoning Distillation", "comment": null, "summary": "Reasoning distillation has attracted increasing attention. It typically leverages a large teacher model to generate reasoning paths, which are then used to fine-tune a student model so that it mimics the teacher's behavior in training contexts. However, previous approaches have lacked a detailed analysis of the origins of the distilled model's capabilities. It remains unclear whether the student can maintain consistent behaviors with the teacher in novel test-time contexts, or whether it regresses to its original output patterns, raising concerns about the generalization of distillation models. To analyse this question, we introduce a cross-model Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing framework. For each action (e.g., a sentence) produced by the distilled model, we obtain the predictive probabilities assigned by the teacher, the original student, and the distilled model under the same context. By comparing these probabilities, we classify each action into different categories. By systematically disentangling the provenance of each action, we experimentally demonstrate that, in test-time contexts, the distilled model can indeed generate teacher-originated actions, which correlate with and plausibly explain observed performance on distilled model. Building on this analysis, we further propose a teacher-guided data selection method. Unlike prior approach that rely on heuristics, our method directly compares teacher-student divergences on the training data, providing a principled selection criterion. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple representative teacher models and diverse student models. The results highlight the utility of our provenance-tracing framework and underscore its promise for reasoning distillation. We hope to share Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing and our insights into reasoning distillation with the community.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u84b8\u998f\u6eaf\u6e90\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u51fa\u6559\u5e08\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u56de\u5f52\u5230\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u51fa\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u84b8\u998f\u6eaf\u6e90\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5bf9\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u6559\u5e08\u3001\u539f\u59cb\u5b66\u751f\u548c\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6982\u7387\u5c06\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u7c7b\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u6765\u6e90\u7c7b\u522b\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u51fa\u6559\u5e08\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5e08\u751f\u5dee\u5f02", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u6e90\u81ea\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5173\u5e76\u80fd\u5408\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "\u6eaf\u6e90\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u63a8\u7406\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u84b8\u998f\u6eaf\u6e90\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u524d\u666f"}}

Despite the promise of multi-modal approaches, challenges like multi-lingual generalization and the absence of a unified evaluation framework persist. To address these gaps, we propose FEND (Foundation model-based Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Disorders), a comprehensive multi-modal framework integrating speech and text modalities for detecting AD, depression, and ASD across the lifespan. Leveraging 13 multi-lingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, Greek, French, and Dutch, we systematically evaluate multi-modal fusion performance. Our results show that multi-modal fusion excels in AD and depression detection but underperforms in ASD due to dataset heterogeneity. We also identify modality imbalance as a prevalent issue, where multi-modal fusion fails to surpass the best mono-modal models.

However, its application is often hindered by the difficulty of collecting large-scale real-world robotic tactile data. In this study, we propose to collect low-cost human manipulation data using haptic gloves for tactile-based robotic policy learning. The misalignment between human and robotic tactile data makes it challenging to transfer policies learned from human data to robots. To bridge this gap, we propose UniTacHand, a unified representation to align robotic tactile information captured by dexterous hands with human hand touch obtained from gloves. First, we project tactile signals from both human hands and robotic hands onto a morphologically consistent 2D surface space of the MANO hand model. This unification standardizes the heterogeneous data structures and inherently embeds the tactile signals with spatial context. Then, we introduce a contrastive learning method to align them into a unified latent space, trained on only 10 minutes of paired data from our data collection system. Our approach enables zero-shot tactile-based policy transfer from humans to a real robot, generalizing to objects unseen in the pre-training data. We also demonstrate that co-training on mixed data, including both human and robotic demonstrations via UniTacHand, yields better performance and data efficiency compared with using only robotic data.

Current hallucination detection methods based on uncertainty estimation and external knowledge retrieval suffer from the limitation that they still produce erroneous content at high confidence levels and rely heavily on retrieval efficiency and knowledge coverage. In contrast, probe methods that leverage the model's hidden-layer states offer real-time and lightweight advantages. However, traditional linear probes struggle to capture nonlinear structures in deep semantic spaces.To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural network-based framework for token-level hallucination detection. By freezing language model parameters, we employ lightweight MLP probes to perform nonlinear modeling of high-level hidden states. A multi-objective joint loss function is designed to enhance detection stability and semantic disambiguity. Additionally, we establish a layer position-probe performance response model, using Bayesian optimization to automatically search for optimal probe insertion layers and achieve superior training results.Experimental results on LongFact, HealthBench, and TriviaQA demonstrate that MLP probes significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, recall, and detection capability under low false-positive conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eMLP\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u4f18\u63d2\u5165\u5c42\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u751f\u6210\u5e7b\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8bcd\u5143\u7ea7\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u51bb\u7ed3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7MLP\u63a2\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5c42\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8054\u5408\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6d88\u6b67\uff1b3\uff09\u5efa\u7acb\u5c42\u4f4d\u7f6e-\u63a2\u9488\u6027\u80fd\u54cd\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u81ea\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u4f18\u63a2\u9488\u63d2\u5165\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u5728LongFact\u3001HealthBench\u548cTriviaQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMLP\u63a2\u9488\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MLP\u63a2\u9488\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u4fdd\u969c\u3002"}}

However, collecting demonstration datasets is costly: it often requires access to robots and needs sustained effort in a tedious, long process. These factors limit the scale of data available for training policies. We aim to address this scalability challenge by involving a broader audience in a gamified data collection experience that is both accessible and motivating. Specifically, we develop a gamified remote teleoperation platform, RoboCade, to engage general users in collecting data that is beneficial for downstream policy training. To do this, we embed gamification strategies into the design of the system interface and data collection tasks. In the system interface, we include components such as visual feedback, sound effects, goal visualizations, progress bars, leaderboards, and badges. We additionally propose principles for constructing gamified tasks that have overlapping structure with useful downstream target tasks. We instantiate RoboCade on three manipulation tasks -- including spatial arrangement, scanning, and insertion. To illustrate the viability of gamified robot data collection, we collect a demonstration dataset through our platform, and show that co-training robot policies with this data can improve success rate on non-gamified target tasks (+16-56%). Further, we conduct a user study to validate that novice users find the gamified platform significantly more enjoyable than a standard non-gamified platform (+24%). These results highlight the promise of gamified data collection as a scalable, accessible, and engaging method for collecting demonstration data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1RoboCade\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u8fdc\u7a0b\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u754c\u9762\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5438\u5f15\u666e\u901a\u7528\u6237\u6536\u96c6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8da3\u5473\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u4eff\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u6536\u96c6\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u8017\u65f6\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u4f53\u9a8c\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1RoboCade\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u8fdc\u7a0b\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u754c\u9762\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u97f3\u6548\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3001\u8fdb\u5ea6\u6761\u3001\u6392\u884c\u699c\u548c\u5fbd\u7ae0\u7b49\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u6784\u5efa\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u53e0\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u7a7a\u95f4\u6392\u5217\u3001\u626b\u63cf\u548c\u63d2\u5165\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u6536\u96c6\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e0e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u5171\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u975e\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad816-56%\u3002\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65b0\u624b\u7528\u6237\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u5e73\u53f0\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u975e\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u5e73\u53f0\u66f4\u6709\u8da3\uff08+24%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6613\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e14\u5f15\u4eba\u5165\u80dc\u7684\u6536\u96c6\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

To successfully complete tasks, the LLM must be grounded in the environment in which the robot operates. One solution is to use a scene graph that contains all the necessary information. Modern methods rely on prebuilt scene graphs and assume that all task-relevant information is available at the start of planning. However, these approaches do not account for changes in the environment that may occur between the graph construction and the task execution. We propose LookPlanGraph - a method that leverages a scene graph composed of static assets and object priors. During plan execution, LookPlanGraph continuously updates the graph with relevant objects, either by verifying existing priors or discovering new entities. This is achieved by processing the agents egocentric camera view using a Vision Language Model. We conducted experiments with changed object positions VirtualHome and OmniGibson simulated environments, demonstrating that LookPlanGraph outperforms methods based on predefined static scene graphs. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach, we also conducted experiments in a real-world setting. Additionally, we introduce the GraSIF (Graph Scenes for Instruction Following) dataset with automated validation framework, comprising 514 tasks drawn from SayPlan Office, BEHAVIOR-1K, and VirtualHome RobotHow.

Unlike standard prompting, CoT encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, non-answer tokens, that help guide the model toward more accurate final outputs. These intermediate steps enable more complex reasoning processes such as error correction, memory management, future planning, and self-reflection. However, applying CoT to non-natural language domains, such as protein and RNA language models, is not yet possible, primarily due to the limited expressiveness of their token spaces (e.g., amino acid tokens). In this work, we propose and define the concept of language expressiveness: the ability of a given language, using its tokens and grammar, to encode information. We show that the limited expressiveness of protein language severely restricts the applicability of CoT-style reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce reflection pretraining, for the first time in a biological sequence model, which enables the model to engage in intermediate reasoning through the generation of auxiliary \"thinking tokens\" beyond simple answer tokens. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our augmented token set significantly enhances biological language expressiveness, thereby improving the overall reasoning capacity of the model. Experimentally, our pretraining approach teaches protein models to self-correct and leads to substantial performance gains compared to standard pretraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\"\u601d\u8003\u6807\u8bb0\"\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u7269\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u514b\u670d\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u3002", "motivation": "\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u548cRNA\u7b49\u975e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5176\u6807\u8bb0\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u5982\u6c28\u57fa\u9178\u6807\u8bb0\uff09\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u601d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u7269\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u8d85\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u7b54\u6848\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\"\u601d\u8003\u6807\u8bb0\"\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u7269\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u96c6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\uff0c\u53cd\u601d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6559\u4f1a\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u601d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f15\u5165\u601d\u8003\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u5f0f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, distillation over lengthy sequences with prompt (P), chain-of-thought (CoT), and answer (A) segments makes the process computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate how the allocation of supervision across different segments (P, CoT, A) affects student performance. Our analysis shows that selective knowledge distillation over only the CoT tokens can be effective when the prompt and answer information is encompassed by it. Building on this insight, we establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. We observe that training on only the first $50\\%$ of tokens of every training sequence can retain, on average, $\\approx94\\%$ of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about $50\\%$ each. These findings suggest that reasoning distillation benefits from prioritizing early reasoning tokens and provides a simple lever for computation-quality tradeoffs.

This reduces focus on the much shorter but essential Key portion-the final answer, whose correctness directly determines task success and evaluation quality. To address this limitation, we propose SFTKey, a two-stage training scheme. In the first stage, conventional SFT is applied to ensure proper output format, while in the second stage, only the Key portion is fine-tuned to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families demonstrate that SFTKey achieves an average accuracy improvement exceeding 5\\% over conventional SFT, while preserving the ability to generate correct formats.

This structure-semantics heterogeneity implies that no graph learning model with a fixed inductive bias can generalize optimally across diverse graph domains. However, most existing methods address this challenge from the model side by incrementally injecting new inductive biases, which remains fundamentally limited given the open-ended diversity of real-world graphs. In this work, we take a data-centric perspective and treat node semantics as a task-adaptive variable. We propose a Data-Adaptive Semantic Refinement framework DAS for graph representation learning, which couples a fixed graph neural network (GNN) and a large language model (LLM) in a closed feedback loop. The GNN provides implicit supervisory signals to guide the semantic refinement of LLM, and the refined semantics are fed back to update the same graph learner. We evaluate our approach on both text-rich and text-free graphs. Results show consistent improvements on structure-dominated graphs while remaining competitive on semantics-rich graphs, demonstrating the effectiveness of data-centric semantic adaptation under structure-semantics heterogeneity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDAS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9aGNN\u4e0eLLM\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5c06\u8282\u70b9\u8bed\u4e49\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff1a\u6709\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u8282\u70b9\u8bed\u4e49\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u89d2\u5ea6\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65e0\u9650\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u9886\u57df\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bed\u4e49\u7cbe\u70bc\u6846\u67b6DAS\uff0c\u5c06\u56fa\u5b9a\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(GNN)\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u8026\u5408\u5728\u95ed\u73af\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u3002GNN\u63d0\u4f9b\u9690\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u6307\u5bfcLLM\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7cbe\u70bc\uff0c\u7cbe\u70bc\u540e\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u53cd\u9988\u7ed9\u540c\u4e00\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6587\u672c\u4e30\u5bcc\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7684\u56fe\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u56fe\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u56fe\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bed\u4e49\u9002\u5e94\u5728\u7ed3\u6784-\u8bed\u4e49\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8282\u70b9\u8bed\u4e49\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\uff0cDAS\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7ed3\u6784-\u8bed\u4e49\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u9886\u57df\u7684\u66f4\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u3002"}}

Currently, there are several guardrails in place for all public LLMs and multiple proposed datasets for training safety classifiers. However, training these safety classifiers relies on large quantities of labeled data, which can be problematic to acquire, prone to labeling errors, or often include synthetic data. To address these issues, we suggest a different approach: utilizing semi-supervised learning techniques, which leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, to improve the performance on the safety task. We analyze the improvements that these techniques can offer for both prompts given to Large Language Models and the responses to those requests. Moreover, since augmentation is the central part of semi-supervised algorithms, we demonstrate the importance of using task-specific augmentations, which significantly increase the performance when compared to general-purpose augmentation techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\u3001\u5bb9\u6613\u5b58\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4e14\u7ecf\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5f3a\u8c03\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u901a\u7528\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u76f8\u6bd4\u901a\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5b89\u5168\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, existing LLM-focused clarification benchmarks primarily assume single-turn interactions or cooperative users, limiting their ability to evaluate clarification behavior in realistic settings. We introduce \\textbf{ClarifyMT-Bench}, a benchmark for multi-turn clarification grounded in a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy and a set of six behaviorally diverse simulated user personas. Through a hybrid LLM-human pipeline, we construct 6,120 multi-turn dialogues capturing diverse ambiguity sources and interaction patterns. Evaluating ten representative LLMs uncovers a consistent under-clarification bias: LLMs tend to answer prematurely, and performance degrades as dialogue depth increases. To mitigate this, we propose \\textbf{ClarifyAgent}, an agentic approach that decomposes clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning, substantially improving robustness across ambiguity conditions.

To address this gap, this paper introduces SpidR-Adapt for rapid adaptation to new languages using minimal unlabeled data. We cast such low-resource speech representation learning as a meta-learning problem and construct a multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) protocol which formulates the adaptation process as a bi-level optimization framework. To enable scalable meta-training under this framework, we propose a novel heuristic solution, first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO), avoiding heavy computation costs. Finally, we stabilize meta-training by using a robust initialization through interleaved supervision which alternates self-supervised and supervised objectives. Empirically, SpidR-Adapt achieves rapid gains in phonemic discriminability (ABX) and spoken language modeling (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC), improving over in-domain language models after training on less than 1h of target-language audio, over $100\\times$ more data-efficient than standard training.

Off the shelf transformers, especially compact ones, treat this material as a flat stream of tokens. This approach leads to confident but incorrect numeric answers and forces the models to memorize separate facts inefficiently. SMART (Structured Memory and Reasoning Transformer) offers a different and practical solution to the above problem. SMART structures its processing by using a hierarchical approach, and is based upon three main job categories (1) A syntax-aware Fact Extractor (Grammarian) Tree LSTM which extracts facts as subject relation object relations from EM sentences (2) A compact indexed memory MANN (Memory Augmented Neural Network) that indexes these Rational Subject Relation Objects as 384 dimensional vectors that are associated with the source of the information, and (3) A 6 layer Transformer that learns to fuse the previously retrieved facts into its generated response. The entire SMART model utilizes 45.51M parameters, which is 64% less than GPT-2 (124M) and 69% less than BERT (133M), and it achieves a 21.3% higher accuracy than GPT-2, indicating that SMART fits the data better with the least amount of processing requirements.

Despite their apparent simplicity for humans, these tasks remain challenging for frontier vision-language models (VLMs), a gap commonly attributed to deficiencies in machine reasoning. We challenge this interpretation and hypothesize that the gap arises primarily from limitations in visual perception rather than from shortcomings in inductive reasoning.\n  To verify this hypothesis, we introduce a two-stage experimental pipeline that explicitly separates perception and reasoning. In the perception stage, each image is independently converted into a natural-language description, while in the reasoning stage a model induces and applies rules using these descriptions. This design prevents leakage of cross-image inductive signals and isolates reasoning from perception bottlenecks. Across three ARC-style datasets, Mini-ARC, ACRE, and Bongard-LOGO, we show that the perception capability is the dominant factor underlying the observed performance gap by comparing the two-stage pipeline with against standard end-to-end one-stage evaluation. Manual inspection of reasoning traces in the VLM outputs further reveals that approximately 80 percent of model failures stem from perception errors. Together, these results demonstrate that ARC-style benchmarks conflate perceptual and reasoning challenges and that observed performance gaps may overstate deficiencies in machine reasoning. Our findings underscore the need for evaluation protocols that disentangle perception from reasoning when assessing progress in machine intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARC\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7f3a\u9677\u800c\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9ARC\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u4e3b\u6d41\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5373\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5dee\u8ddd\u6e90\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5047\u8bbe\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u9650\u5236\u800c\u975e\u5f52\u7eb3\u63a8\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u611f\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u72ec\u7acb\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u5219\u5f52\u7eb3\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u9632\u6b62\u8de8\u56fe\u50cf\u5f52\u7eb3\u4fe1\u53f7\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u9694\u79bb\u611f\u77e5\u74f6\u9888\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728Mini-ARC\u3001ACRE\u548cBongard-LOGO\u4e09\u4e2aARC\u98ce\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u624b\u52a8\u68c0\u67e5VLM\u8f93\u51fa\u53d1\u73b0\u7ea680%\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u6e90\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "ARC\u98ce\u683c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u53ef\u80fd\u5938\u5927\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5206\u79bb\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u667a\u80fd\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

We are the first to formalize this issue, attributing the variability in output quality to the cumulative predictive uncertainty along a generative path. To quantify this uncertainty, we introduce Denoising Entropy, a computable metric that serves as an internal signal for evaluating generative process. Leveraging this metric, we propose two algorithms designed to optimize the decoding path: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our entropy-guided methods significantly improve generation quality, consistently boosting accuracy on challenging reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks. Our work establishes Denoising Entropy as a principled tool for understanding and controlling generation, effectively turning the uncertainty in MDMs from a liability into a key advantage for discovering high-quality solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "MDMs\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u53d7\u89e3\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u53bb\u566a\u71b5\u91cf\u5316\u751f\u6210\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e24\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf", "motivation": "\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08MDMs\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u89e3\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u9996\u6b21\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\"\u53bb\u566a\u71b5\"\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u7801\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u4e8b\u540e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6307\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "conclusion": "\u53bb\u566a\u71b5\u6210\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06MDMs\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ece\u8d1f\u62c5\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f18\u52bf"}}
