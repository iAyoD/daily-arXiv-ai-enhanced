Result: 多任务学习框架准确率43.6%，两阶段方法准确率47.8%，后者表现更优。

Conclusion: 两阶段方法证明了场景条件建模在熟练度估计中的有效性。

Abstract: This report presents the CuriosAI team's submission to the EgoExo4D
Proficiency Estimation Challenge at CVPR 2025. We propose two methods for
multi-view skill assessment: (1) a multi-task learning framework using
Sapiens-2B that jointly predicts proficiency and scenario labels (43.6 %
accuracy), and (2) a two-stage pipeline combining zero-shot scenario
recognition with view-specific VideoMAE classifiers (47.8 % accuracy). The
superior performance of the two-stage approach demonstrates the effectiveness
of scenario-conditioned modeling for proficiency estimation.

*Mihir Gupta,Abhay Mangla,Ross Greer,Pratik Desai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合提示专家评估和自一致性机制的农业图像处理框架，显著提升了玉米叶病识别的准确性和治疗建议效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在农业领域表现不佳，需要提高其在精准农业中的可靠性。

Method: 采用基于提示的专家评估协议和余弦一致性自投票机制，结合领域适应的嵌入技术。

Result: 玉米叶病诊断准确率从82.2%提升至87.8%，症状分析从38.9%提升至52.2%，治疗建议从27.8%提升至43.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法在资源受限环境中具有实际应用潜力，支持实时农业决策。

Abstract: Precision agriculture relies heavily on accurate image analysis for crop
disease identification and treatment recommendation, yet existing
vision-language models (VLMs) often underperform in specialized agricultural
domains. This work presents a domain-aware framework for agricultural image
processing that combines prompt-based expert evaluation with self-consistency
mechanisms to enhance VLM reliability in precision agriculture applications. We
introduce two key innovations: (1) a prompt-based evaluation protocol that
configures a language model as an expert plant pathologist for scalable
assessment of image analysis outputs, and (2) a cosine-consistency self-voting
mechanism that generates multiple candidate responses from agricultural images
and selects the most semantically coherent diagnosis using domain-adapted
embeddings. Applied to maize leaf disease identification from field images
using a fine-tuned PaliGemma model, our approach improves diagnostic accuracy
from 82.2\% to 87.8\%, symptom analysis from 38.9\% to 52.2\%, and treatment
recommendation from 27.8\% to 43.3\% compared to standard greedy decoding. The
system remains compact enough for deployment on mobile devices, supporting
real-time agricultural decision-making in resource-constrained environments.
These results demonstrate significant potential for AI-driven precision
agriculture tools that can operate reliably in diverse field conditions.

### [4] [Towards Evaluating Robustness of Prompt Adherence in Text to Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08039)
*Sujith Vemishetty,Advitiya Arora,Anupama Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估文本到图像模型的新框架，重点关注其对提示的遵循能力，并揭示了模型在生成简单二进制图像时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态LLMs和文本到图像模型的研究相对不足，其可靠性和性能评估缺乏系统性，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 创建了一个新数据集，利用GPT-4生成文本描述作为基准，通过文本到图像模型生成图像，再通过GPT-4比较描述差异。

Result: 模型在生成仅包含简单几何形状和位置的二进制图像时表现不佳，且无法遵循输入数据分布。

Conclusion: 文本到图像模型在遵循提示和生成特定分布图像方面仍有显著改进空间。

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many,
showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their
potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant
research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal
LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially
when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to
insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper
aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image
models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a
novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating
images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text
prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable
Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro
1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions
generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used
to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the
Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o
using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two
descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple
binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and
its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they
fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

### [5] [ConsNoTrainLoRA: Data-driven Weight Initialization of Low-rank Adapters using Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08044)
*Debasmit Das,Hyoungwoo Park,Munawar Hayat,Seokeon Choi,Sungrack Yun,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CNTLoRA的数据驱动权重初始化方法，用于改进LoRA微调的收敛性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA权重矩阵随机初始化且固定秩，限制了性能。

Method: 将LoRA初始化视为域转移问题，通过约束预训练和微调激活关系，得到闭式权重估计，无需训练即可初始化。

Result: 在图像生成、分类和理解等任务中，CNTLoRA优于标准和数据驱动初始化方法。

Conclusion: CNTLoRA提供了一种更快收敛和更高性能的优化方案。

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently
fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight
matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment
points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA
fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,
ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift
problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and
fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a
closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and
fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during
initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and
down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed
initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image
generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and
data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations
further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal
recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

### [6] [A Hybrid Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine for Image Classification with an Application to Quadcopters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08047)
*Rolando A. Hernandez-Hernandez,Adrian Rubio-Solis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于ELM-AE和区间类型2模糊逻辑理论的混合多层极限学习机（HML-ELM），用于无人机图像分类。该方法通过无监督特征提取和监督分类两阶段实现高效分类，实验证明其优于其他类似方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多层极限学习机（ML-ELM）及其变体在自然信号分类中表现优异，但需要进一步提升分类效率和准确性，尤其是在无人机图像分类等实际应用中。

Method: 提出HML-ELM方法，结合ELM-AE和区间类型2模糊逻辑理论，分两阶段实现：1）自学习特征提取（多层ELM-AE堆叠）；2）监督分类（使用改进的SIT2-FELM）。

Result: 实验表明，HML-ELM在图像分类任务中表现优于ML-ELM、ML-FELM和ELM等现有方法。

Conclusion: HML-ELM是一种高效的图像分类方法，尤其适用于无人机等实际应用场景。

Abstract: Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and its variants have proven to
be an effective technique for the classification of different natural signals
such as audio, video, acoustic and images. In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer
Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder
(ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active
image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The
proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of
two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature
classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by
stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of
high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are
classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with
a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of
the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement
(COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments
for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied
to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a
number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four
different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior
efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer
Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

Abstract: Cloud and cloud shadow masking is a crucial preprocessing step in
hyperspectral satellite imaging, enabling the extraction of high-quality,
analysis-ready data. This study evaluates various machine learning approaches,
including gradient boosting methods such as XGBoost and LightGBM as well as
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). All boosting and CNN models achieved
accuracies exceeding 93%. Among the investigated models, the CNN with feature
reduction emerged as the most efficient, offering a balance of high accuracy,
low storage requirements, and rapid inference times on both CPUs and GPUs.
Variations of this version, with only up to 597 trainable parameters,
demonstrated the best trade-off in terms of deployment feasibility, accuracy,
and computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the potential of
lightweight artificial intelligence (AI) models for real-time hyperspectral
image processing, supporting the development of on-board satellite AI systems
for space-based applications.

### [8] [The relative importance of being Gaussian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08059)
*F. Alberto Grünbaum,Tondgi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在去噪算法中使用非高斯噪声（如均匀分布或Beta分布）的性能表现，而非修改算法以适应噪声类型。实验在小型设备上进行，结果对算法在不同噪声条件下的适用性提出了挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高斯噪声设计的去噪算法在非高斯噪声条件下的表现，以验证其鲁棒性和普适性。

Method: 使用均匀分布、Beta分布或混合高斯噪声替代原算法中的高斯噪声，并在小型设备上进行实验。

Result: 算法在非高斯噪声条件下的性能表现与高斯噪声设计时的预期不同，显示出局限性。

Conclusion: 算法对噪声类型的依赖性较强，未来需进一步研究在不同噪声环境下的适应性改进。

Abstract: The remarkable results for denoising in computer vision using diffusion
models given in \cite{SDWMG,HJA,HHG} yield a robust mathematical justification
for algorithms based on crucial properties of a sequence of Gaussian
independent $N(0,1)$ random variables. In particular the derivations use the
fact that a Gaussian distribution is determined by its mean and variance and
that the sum of two Gaussians is another Gaussian.
  \bigskip
  The issue raised in this short note is the following: suppose we use the
algorithm without any changes but replace the nature of the noise and use, for
instance, uniformly distributed noise or noise with a Beta distribution, or
noise which is a random superposition of two Gaussians with very different
variances. One could, of course, try to modify the algorithm keeping in mind
the nature of the noise, but this is not what we do. Instead we study the
performance of the algorithm when used with noise that is very far in nature
from the Gaussian case, where it is designed to work well.
  Usually these algorithms are implemented on very powerful computers. Our
experiments are all carried out on a small laptop and for the smallest possible
image size. Exploring how our observations are confirmed or changed when
dealing in different situations remains an interesting challenge.

### [9] [An Object-Based Deep Learning Approach for Building Height Estimation from Single SAR Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08096)
*Babak Memar,Luigi Russo,Silvia Liberata Ullo,Paolo Gamba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的自动化方法，利用单张超高分辨率SAR图像估计建筑物高度，并在多大陆数据集上验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确估计建筑物高度对城市应用至关重要，而现有方法在跨城市和跨大陆泛化能力上存在不足。

Method: 采用基于边界框检测的对象回归方法，结合深度学习模型，利用多大陆数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: 模型在欧洲城市表现优异（MAE约2.20米），但在亚洲城市泛化时性能有所下降。

Conclusion: 深度学习在单张VHR SAR图像建筑物高度估计中具有显著的跨城市和跨大陆迁移学习潜力。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR)
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban
applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for
automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an
object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by
height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique
multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across
Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation
strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The
results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European
cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately
one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent
state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased
variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,
particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of
high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL
for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building
height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

### [10] [RegGS: Unposed Sparse Views Gaussian Splatting with 3DGS Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08136)
*Chong Cheng,Yu Hu,Sicheng Yu,Beizhen Zhao,Zijian Wang,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegGS是一种基于3D高斯注册的框架，用于重建无姿态稀疏视图，通过熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法实现高效对齐，并在实验中表现出高保真度和高质量的新视角合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于优化的3DGS方法在稀疏视图下表现不佳的问题，以及前馈高斯方法输入格式受限的挑战。

Method: 提出RegGS框架，利用熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法计算最优传输距离，结合光度一致性和深度几何进行联合注册。

Result: 在RE10K和ACID数据集上，RegGS实现了高保真的局部高斯注册，精确的相机姿态估计和高质量的新视角合成。

Conclusion: RegGS通过全局一致的高斯表示和联合注册模块，有效解决了稀疏视图重建的挑战。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing
scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle
with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward
Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to
incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a
3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse
views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into
a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an
entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal
transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an
alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.
Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the
$\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This
enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating
camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets
demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high
fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view
synthesis. Project page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/reggs/.

*Hyungjun Doh,Dong In Lee,Seunggeun Chi,Pin-Hao Huang,Kwonjoon Lee,Sangpil Kim,Karthik Ramani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从单目视频重建动态人-物交互的新框架，解决了遮挡和时间不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D重建方法通常假设静态物体或动态主体完全可见，导致在遮挡情况下性能下降。

Method: 利用模态补全推断部分遮挡区域的完整结构，结合时间上下文确保视频序列的一致性。

Result: 在挑战性单目视频上验证，显示在处理遮挡和时间稳定性方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该框架无需模板，适应性强，显著提升了动态场景中复杂细节的恢复能力。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object
interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with
occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods
typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading
to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in
scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework
leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially
obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual
frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across
video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This
template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on
predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in
dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on
challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling
occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

Result: 在特定引导策略下，该方法在ImageNet上提高了认证准确率和标准准确率。

Conclusion: 自适应扩散去噪平滑方法在对抗样本防御中表现出色，同时提升模型性能。

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing, a method for certifying the
predictions of a vision model against adversarial examples, while adapting to
the input. Our key insight is to reinterpret a guided denoising diffusion model
as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms
refining a pure noise sample into an image. We show that these adaptive
mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the
end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable
certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis. We
demonstrate that our design, under a specific guiding strategy, can improve
both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an $\ell_2$
threat model.

Result: 系统实现了轻量级实时性能，mAP50达到0.801。

Conclusion: 提出的系统能有效帮助视障人士安全通行，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Visually impaired people face significant challenges in their day-to-day
commutes in the urban cities of Bangladesh due to the vast number of
obstructions on every path. With many injuries taking place through road
accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that
can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To
overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to
assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without
colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to
objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to
train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both
models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the
utilization of quantization techniques to make them lightweight and efficient,
allowing them to be easily deployed on embedded systems. The proposed solution
achieved a lightweight real-time depth estimation and object detection model
with an mAP50 of 0.801.

### [14] [HNOSeg-XS: Extremely Small Hartley Neural Operator for Efficient and Resolution-Robust 3D Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08205)
*Ken C. L. Wong,Hongzhi Wang,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HNOSeg-XS架构，通过Hartley变换和傅里叶神经算子解决医学图像分割中的分辨率鲁棒性问题，实现了高效、低参数和快速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNN和Transformer在医学图像分割中因计算和内存限制导致的分辨率降低问题，以及由此产生的次优结果。

Method: 使用可学习的偏微分方程建模图像分割，通过Hartley变换替代傅里叶变换，在频域中重新定义问题，构建HNOSeg-XS模型。

Result: 在BraTS'23、KiTS'23和MVSeg'23数据集上测试，HNOSeg-XS表现出色，参数少于34.7k，推理时间<0.24秒，内存占用<1.8 GiB。

Conclusion: HNOSeg-XS是一种分辨率鲁棒、高效且参数极少的医学图像分割模型，优于CNN和Transformer模型。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of
convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through
consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and
memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer
layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For
transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head
attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is
computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size
reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.
Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise
training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on
higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the
resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by
learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator
which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier
transform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the
frequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,
fast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the
BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS
showed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model
parameters. It also achieved the overall best inference time (< 0.24 s) and
memory efficiency (< 1.8 GiB) compared to the tested CNN and transformer
models.

Motivation: 解决StarDist-3D在实例参数化维度与分辨率耦合的问题，并支持高分辨率预测。

Method: 修改StarDist-3D架构，使用双三次Bézier三角形表示实例表面。

Result: 在生物医学成像的斑点状实例数据集上表现优于StarDist-3D。

Conclusion: 可解释的实例表面模型可以与实例成员关系一起有效学习。

Abstract: We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for
three-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction
of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric
surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a
modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks
StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance
voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to
arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.
  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging,
SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance
parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one
synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D.
These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be
learned effectively alongside instance membership.

Abstract: Accurate identification of fungi species presents a unique challenge in
computer vision due to fine-grained inter-species variation and high
intra-species variation. This paper presents our approach for the FungiCLEF
2025 competition, which focuses on few-shot fine-grained visual categorization
(FGVC) using the FungiTastic Few-Shot dataset. Our team (DS@GT) experimented
with multiple vision transformer models, data augmentation, weighted sampling,
and incorporating textual information. We also explored generative AI models
for zero-shot classification using structured prompting but found them to
significantly underperform relative to vision-based models. Our final model
outperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of
domain specific pretraining and balanced sampling strategies. Our approach
ranked 35/74 on the private test set in post-completion evaluation, this
suggests additional work can be done on metadata selection and domain-adapted
multi-modal learning. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中缺乏客观测量运动功能的方法，限制了生物力学数据的应用。PBL旨在填补这一空白，提供可扩展、低负担的工具。

Method: 开发了基于智能手机的PBL系统，包括数据收集应用和生物力学模型拟合算法，并在神经外科和运动医学诊所验证其可用性。

Result: PBL的关节角度误差在3度以内，步态指标可靠且对临床差异敏感，与患者报告结果（如mJOA评分）相关性高。

Conclusion: PBL为临床提供了可扩展的生物力学测量工具，支持智能手机视频作为监测运动功能障碍的有效手段。

Abstract: The way a person moves is a direct reflection of their neurological and
musculoskeletal health, yet it remains one of the most underutilized vital
signs in clinical practice. Although clinicians visually observe movement
impairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure
movement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical
measurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or
earlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics
Laboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for
data collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this
data. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large,
clinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of
our system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle
errors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury,
lower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to
being easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability
and were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals
undergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a
common patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics
correlated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical
intervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use
of handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing
clinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward
accessible monitoring of mobility impairments. We release the first clinically
validated method for measuring whole-body kinematics from handheld smartphone
video at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR分辨率提升导致散射特性差异增加，影响目标检测模型的泛化能力，现有领域适应技术存在特征适应盲目和语义传播不可靠的问题。

Method: CR-Net包含SHFA模块（结构感知特征适应）和RSAA模块（可靠语义对齐），通过结构先验和证据学习理论优化领域适应。

Result: 实验表明，CR-Net在跨分辨率SAR目标检测中表现优异，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: CR-Net通过结构感知和可靠语义对齐，有效解决了跨分辨率SAR目标检测的领域适应问题。

Abstract: In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly
benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However,
the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering
characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target
detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,
the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to
blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately
degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that
incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection
model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To
be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature
Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA
module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and
achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the
interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module
is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure
adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source
domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the
detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from
different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances
cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving
discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
cross-resolution SAR target detection.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film
production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content
synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,
temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing
stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate
talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video
preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This
framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current
limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating
optimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline
to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region
segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.
To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling
strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid
(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion
consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,
thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In
addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively
refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video
generation.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation
quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian
while with 150 FPS inference speed. Our project homepage is

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the
identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map
a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known
identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning.
In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person
given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for
cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that
share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space
where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar
observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of
comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between
similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of
skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40
volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were
collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to
train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide
satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医学图像分析中取得显著进展，但模型大且不透明限制了其临床应用。

Method: 通过选择性保留每层最相关部分，实现针对性压缩，保持临床有意义的表示。

Result: 在多个医学图像分类基准测试中，该方法实现了高压缩率且精度损失最小。

Conclusion: 为医疗场景中轻量级、可解释模型的部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet
its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and
lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques
such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated
Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components
within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we
introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model
complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By
selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method
enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful
representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with
minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models
suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统生成概念瓶颈模型依赖辅助视觉线索的问题，提升模型的解释性和组合性。

Method: 利用扩散能量函数引导，支持后处理干预（如概念组合和否定），通过显式概念传递信息。

Result: 在StyleGAN2预训练模型上的实验表明，CoCo-Bot在概念级可控性和可解释性上表现更好，同时保持视觉质量。

Conclusion: CoCo-Bot通过消除辅助线索，显著提升了生成模型的可解释性和组合性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable
generative modeling by routing generation through explicit,
human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on
auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not
captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and
compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept
bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by
transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by
diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc
interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary
concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that
CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while
maintaining competitive visual quality.

Result: 在四种癌症类型的基准测试中，模型表现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为跨癌症多模态预后提供了实用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data
for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on
single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across
cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis
models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios,
despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address
this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for
Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer
type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded
features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To
tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information
Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR
mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based
sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality
signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses
local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.
Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior
generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer
multimodal prognosis. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有深度隐写方案因大负载和单一范围特征提取（纯卷积或纯Transformer）易被隐写分析器检测，需改进以增强隐蔽性。

Method: 结合卷积的局部范围和Transformer的全局范围特性构建MRAG框架，引入多粒度信息输入，并设计特征角度-范数解耦损失约束生成隐写图像。

Result: 实验表明MRAG在隐写图像的秘密恢复性和隐蔽性上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MRAG通过多范围表示和对抗性扰动注入，有效提升了隐写图像的抗检测能力。

Abstract: Deep hiding has been exploring the hiding capability of deep learning-based
models, aiming to conceal image-level messages into cover images and reveal
them from generated stego images. Existing schemes are easily detected by
steganalyzers due to their large payloads and their limitation to feature
extraction based solely on either pure convolution or pure transformer
operators within a single range, as well as pixel-level loss constraints. To
address the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial
attacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range
representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from
a steganalysis perspective. Specifically, we integrate the local-range neighbor
reception characteristic of the convolution and the global-range dependency
modeling of the transformer to construct MRAG. Meanwhile, we use the
transformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency
decomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a
features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated
stegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's
classified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial
perturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring
that stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Cycle Context Verification (CCV)的新框架，通过自我验证预测和增强上下文对齐，改进了基于上下文学习（ICL）的医学图像分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床场景中，由于标注医学图像的稀缺性，选择最优的上下文图像-掩码对具有挑战性，且微调基础ICL模型在计算成本和灾难性遗忘风险下不可行。

Method: CCV采用循环流程，首先生成查询图像的分割掩码，随后交换查询和上下文对的角色，通过预测原始上下文图像的掩码验证初始预测的准确性。引入查询特定提示以优化对齐。

Result: 在七个医学图像分割数据集上评估，CCV优于现有方法，证明了其在通用医学图像分割中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CCV通过增强上下文对齐和自我验证，显著提升了ICL在医学图像分割中的性能，为通用分割提供了稳健解决方案。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving
universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest
across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless,
its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image
and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of
annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context
pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible
due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address
this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework
that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling
self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual
alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model
initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the
roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to
validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context
image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure
of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to
alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the
alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven
medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,
demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight
CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution
for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available at

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在交通场景解读中的应用潜力，尤其是为老年驾驶员评估提供支持工具。

Method: 采用零样本、少样本和多样本提示策略，评估模型在交通密度、交叉口可见性和停车标志识别任务中的表现，以人工标注为参考标准。

Result: 提示设计显著影响性能，多样本提示下交叉口可见性召回率从21.7%提升至57.0%，交通密度一致性从53.5%增至67.6%。停车标志检测精度高（86.3%），但召回率较低（76.7%）。

Conclusion: 设计良好的提示策略可提升大语言模型在驾驶风险评估中的实用性，未来需扩展数据集和模型架构以优化性能。

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a multimodal large language model
(LLM), specifically ChatGPT-4o, to perform human-like interpretations of
traffic scenes using static dashcam images. Herein, we focus on three judgment
tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density,
assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition.
These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection.
Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated
the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference
standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results
indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for
intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0%
(multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In
stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a
lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response
tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced
difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's
explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing
interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs
hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments.
Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse
annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver
assessments.

Conclusion: GEFU框架有效提升了低光视觉任务的泛化性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision
have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves
image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or
geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual
quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,
constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain
adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a
generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,
which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm
improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of
low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to
optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on
this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF).
Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an
illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and
propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To
mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and
reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial

Abstract: Real-world applications of computer vision in the humanities require
algorithms to be robust against artistic abstraction, peripheral objects, and
subtle differences between fine-grained target classes. Existing datasets
provide instance-level annotations on artworks but are generally biased towards
the image centre and limited with regard to detailed object classes. The
proposed ODOR dataset fills this gap, offering 38,116 object-level annotations
across 4712 images, spanning an extensive set of 139 fine-grained categories.
Conducting a statistical analysis, we showcase challenging dataset properties,
such as a detailed set of categories, dense and overlapping objects, and
spatial distribution over the whole image canvas. Furthermore, we provide an
extensive baseline analysis for object detection models and highlight the
challenging properties of the dataset through a set of secondary studies.
Inspiring further research on artwork object detection and broader visual
cultural heritage studies, the dataset challenges researchers to explore the
intersection of object recognition and smell perception.

TL;DR: CoDi框架通过两阶段策略（身份传输和身份细化）解决了文本到图像模型中主题一致性与姿势多样性的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在保持主题一致性时牺牲了布局和姿势多样性，限制了视觉叙事的表达力。

Method: CoDi采用身份传输（IT）和身份细化（IR）两阶段策略，分别处理早期和后期去噪步骤，确保主题一致性与姿势多样性。

Result: 实验结果表明，CoDi在主题一致性、姿势多样性和提示保真度方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoDi框架在视觉感知和性能指标上均表现出色，为文本到图像生成提供了更灵活和一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject
identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I)
models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the
cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To
address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I
framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with
diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion,
where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi
adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement
(IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to
transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This
promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in
the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to
further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results
on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that
CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all
metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.

TL;DR: PanMatch是一种通用的基础模型，用于鲁棒的对应匹配，通过统一的2D位移估计框架支持多任务，无需任务特定架构或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖任务特定架构和领域微调，PanMatch旨在通过统一框架实现多任务集成，提升泛化能力。

Method: 提出基于2D位移估计的统一框架，利用大型视觉模型的特征提取器和跨领域数据集预训练。

Result: PanMatch在跨任务评估中优于UniMatch和Flow-Anything，在异常场景下表现优异。

Conclusion: PanMatch展示了通用模型在多任务和异常场景中的潜力，性能媲美任务特定算法。

Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust
correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific
architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo
matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any
two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D
displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a
formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures
or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration
by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented
generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a
robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and
propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features
from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view
matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with
near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature
matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of
PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same
model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task
evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art
task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch
presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as
rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to
yield meaningful results.

TL;DR: SHC提出了一种基于语义哈希中心的三阶段框架，显著提升了大规模图像检索的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖数据无关算法生成哈希中心，忽略了类间语义关系，可能降低检索性能。

Method: SHC通过分类网络识别语义相似性，优化算法生成语义哈希中心，并训练深度哈希网络生成二进制哈希码。

Result: SHC在多个公开数据集上显著优于现有方法，平均MAP@100、MAP@1000和MAP@ALL分别提升7.26%、7.62%和11.71%。

Conclusion: SHC通过保留语义结构，有效提升了哈希码的判别性和检索性能。

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval.
Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types:
point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,
MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each
class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.
However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash
centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may
degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the
idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of
semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those
of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a
three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic
structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities
between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to
varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to
generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing
a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.
Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to
convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public
datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.
Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%
in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuGCP提出了一种多模态条件提示学习范式，通过生成语义和视觉条件提示，提升视觉语言模型在新类别上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决提示学习中类嵌入分布建模不足和跨模态对齐局限于输出层的问题。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型生成语义条件提示，引入注意力互导模块生成视觉条件提示，并通过多提示融合机制整合。

Result: 在14个数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MuGCP通过多模态条件提示学习显著提升了模型的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant
challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen
instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2)
prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the
final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits
their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal
embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance
Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt
generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as
conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts
(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for
image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the
multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention
Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and
semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual
Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal
tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that
integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination
among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and
instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能自然识别和补全遮挡物体，但机器人缺乏类似能力，现有技术难以从部分观察中识别完整物体。

Method: 采用空间对比学习追踪实例在多视图中的光栅化，并引入原位生成利用观测和几何线索指导3D生成模型。

Result: 在复杂场景分解和物体补全实验中，方法表现出优越的分解精度和几何完整性。

Conclusion: InstaScene能有效分解场景并生成视觉完整的物体，为机器人3D感知提供了新思路。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in
cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to
robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques,
which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete
object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new
paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal:
decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To
achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning
by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing
semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from
limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable
observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to
reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world.
Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex
real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior
decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually
intact objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU)，一种无需训练的框架，通过在空间维度上加速扩散变换器的推理，显著减少计算量并保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在高保真图像和视频生成中表现出色，但计算量大阻碍了实际应用。现有方法主要在时间维度上加速，而RALU则专注于空间维度的优化。

Method: RALU采用三阶段混合分辨率采样：1) 低分辨率去噪捕捉全局语义结构；2) 区域自适应上采样处理易产生伪影的区域；3) 全分辨率上采样细化细节。通过噪声时间步重调度稳定分辨率转换。

Result: 在FLUX上实现7倍加速，在Stable Diffusion 3上实现3倍加速，图像质量几乎无损。

Conclusion: RALU是一种高效且与现有时间加速方法互补的空间加速框架，可显著减少推理延迟而不影响生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based
diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering
superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle
to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the
temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps.
Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free
framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs
mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising
latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2)
region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at
full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail
refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage
noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying
resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving
image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$
on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is
complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus
can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without
compromising generation quality.

Result: 方法提升了修复场景的几何保真度和外观一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂场景中实现了更真实且一致的3D修复效果。

Abstract: Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing
realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on
flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a
representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often
leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting
techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to
as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many
plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between
viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend
inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when
there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a
novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and
perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a
reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting
similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an
accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp
the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the
optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies
have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and
appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

Conclusion: VFMTok通过创新设计实现了高效图像分词，为社区提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation
models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel
direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely
underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as
the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two
key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces
redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic
reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the
foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on
these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial
improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also
enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation --
achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model
convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional
synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be
released publicly to benefit the community.

Conclusion: 该技术具有广泛应用前景，但需解决模型精度、可扩展性和动态场景处理等挑战。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional
structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications,
including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While
traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited
by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in
challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has
catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,
exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models
employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry
directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This
survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by
dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including
their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry
regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view
scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast
it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like
MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and
identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and
scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

Motivation: 当前文档识别方法忽视了文档类型特有的结构属性，导致对复杂或低频文档类型的处理效果不佳。

Method: 提出了一种设计结构特定归纳偏置的方法，并基于Transformer架构实现了端到端文档识别系统。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在单音乐谱、形状图和简化工程图等复杂记录结构中表现优异，首次实现了工程图的端到端转录。

Conclusion: 该方法为设计未来文档基础模型提供了统一框架，尤其适用于非标准文档类型的识别。

Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to
encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing
engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document
recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying
document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on
sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more
complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We
suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription
task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents
based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related
document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to
design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned
end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer
architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments
with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape
drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias
for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful
end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently
interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of
document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood
than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of
future document foundation models.

synthetic modality training, F3-Net maintains robust performance even in the
presence of missing MRI sequences, leveraging a zero-image strategy to
substitute absent modalities without relying on explicit synthesis networks,
thereby enhancing real-world applicability. Its unified architecture supports
multi-pathology segmentation across glioma, metastasis, stroke, and white
matter lesions without retraining, outperforming CNN-based and
transformer-based models that typically require disease-specific fine-tuning.
Evaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022,
F3-Net demonstrates strong resilience to domain shifts and clinical
heterogeneity. On the whole pathology dataset, F3-Net achieves average Dice

Abstract: Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era.
While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they
typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we
propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual
Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping
called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions
across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity
features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to
facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature
complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public
dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method
using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build
a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be
publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative
and qualitative results show that our method achieves better rectification
results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset will be

occluded ones. Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts,
applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using
holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion
scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from
holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided
Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),
which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student
distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion
patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified
discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch
through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware
Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern
embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding
occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature
Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent
is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that
contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and
substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature
contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.
Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch
effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust
representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.

*Inye Na,Nejung Rue,Jiwon Chung,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RadiomicsRetrieval的3D医学图像检索框架，结合手工放射组学特征与深度学习嵌入，支持灵活查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法主要支持2D图像且需要完整标注查询，限制了临床灵活性。

Method: 利用可提示分割模型（如SAM）生成肿瘤特异性图像嵌入，并通过对比学习与放射组学特征对齐，结合解剖位置嵌入（APE）增强表示。

Result: 在肺CT和脑MRI数据集上验证，放射组学特征显著提升检索特异性，APE支持基于位置的搜索。

Conclusion: RadiomicsRetrieval框架支持灵活查询，仅需最小用户提示，适用于多种临床场景，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical
decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require
fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we
propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging
handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the
tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits
volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ
a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image
embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same
tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by
anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables
flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive
experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that
radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE
provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.
Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single
point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical
scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected
radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting
diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging
repositories. Our code is available at

TL;DR: SAM 2在目标分割任务中表现优异，成为视觉目标跟踪的SOTA。本文提出用强化学习优化其内存更新，替代手工规则，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手工规则处理干扰、遮挡和运动，限制了SAM 2内存控制的潜力。

Result: 在过拟合设置下，性能提升超过现有启发式方法的三倍。

Conclusion: 强化学习是优化内存控制的有效替代方案，揭示了内存银行的未开发潜力。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in
object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object
tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank,
enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment
SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions,
and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using
reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory
control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a
separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2
that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These
results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight
reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules
for memory control in visual object tracking.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的图像翻译方法DA-KPN，通过轻量级翻译函数和像素级输入变换参数，确保合成标签与翻译结果的语义匹配，提升了语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实数据标注困难，现有方法通过GAN进行图像翻译但无法保证语义匹配，影响语义分割性能。

Method: 提出DA-KPN方法，通过估计像素级输入变换参数，结合多尺度判别器确保翻译结果的真实性。

Result: DA-KPN在合成到真实数据的语义分割任务中优于现有GAN方法，并在人脸解析任务中表现相当。

Conclusion: DA-KPN通过语义匹配保证和轻量级设计，为低数据场景下的语义分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve
the best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate
annotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic
datasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing
domain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes.
Current methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic
matching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the
semantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where
performance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image
translation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that
guarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation.
DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight
and simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is
realistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between
translated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based
methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to
real image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法以体素为基本交互单元，限制了类别级信息的利用，影响了补全结果的粒度。

Method: 采用类查询替代体素查询，结合类特定的几何和语义先验，设计专用解码模块以优化信息流。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360基准测试中达到SOTA性能，mIoU分别为17.35和20.55。

Conclusion: DISC显著提升了实例类别性能，单帧输入甚至优于多帧方法。

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its
pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on
refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels
as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level
information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of
completion results. To address this, we propose \textbf{D}isentangling Instance
and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning
for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization.
Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which
incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we
exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding
modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level
information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and
SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55,
respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using
only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category
performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by
17.9\% and 11.9\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test. The code is

Interactive Visual-semantic Attention (BIVA) enabling iterative information
exchange between modalities. The framework was evaluated on BraTS 2020 dataset

spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion
combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain
tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating
clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了BayesTTA，一种贝叶斯适应框架，用于解决视觉语言模型在时间演化分布偏移下的性能退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理时间连续分布偏移时存在缺陷，如有限的内存缓存、不可靠的熵置信度和静态视觉表示。

Method: BayesTTA通过增量估计类条件高斯混合分布、自适应选择协方差结构和使用GDA进行校准推理，动态对齐视觉表示。

Result: 在四个时间演化数据集和十个标准TTA数据集上，BayesTTA显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BayesTTA在保持高效的同时，显著提升了模型在时间演化分布偏移下的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving
distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination
or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods
are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect
temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache
restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting;
entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening
error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving
inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal
Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over
time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation
framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically
aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates
class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,
adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis
testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis
(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of
normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.
We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving
datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.
Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining
efficiency. Code is available at

Motivation: 研究如何通过最小化训练数据和标注工作量，优化DAN在手写文档转录中的表现。

Method: 使用两种标注策略（标准化标注和外交标注）对DAN进行微调，并在包含相同图像但标注方法不同的数据集上进行实验。

Result: 标准化标注适用于可标准化字段（如日期和出生地），而外交标注在非标准化字段（如姓名和姓氏）上表现更好。

Conclusion: 标注策略应根据字段类型选择，标准化标注和外交标注各有优势。

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN)
for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates,
handwritten in Spanish. We investigate two annotation strategies for
automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal
training data and annotation effort. Experiments were conducted on two datasets
containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more
than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings
indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be
standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation
performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be
standardized.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多帧BEV特征结合能提升3D感知性能，但动态物体运动导致特征变化限制了性能提升，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 使用循环结构结合BEV特征，MBFNet提取运动特征并动态对齐历史与当前特征，通过时序一致性损失显式对齐特征。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到63.9% NDS，性能优于当前最佳方法SOLOFusion。

Conclusion: OnlineBEV通过时序特征对齐和循环结构，显著提升了相机3D感知性能。

Abstract: Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view
(BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations.
Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods
can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from
multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of
an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited
when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to
dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this
paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,
which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This
structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal
memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time
to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion
Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion
features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV
features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal
feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which
captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments
conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves
significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion.
OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording
state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.

Result: 在扩展现有数据集和从零创建新数据集的实验中，DatasetAgent构建的数据集成功用于训练多种视觉模型。

Conclusion: DatasetAgent能够高效构建高质量的真实世界图像数据集，满足用户需求。

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets
usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual
collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation.
Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to
artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image
datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing
datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as
DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image
optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets
according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of
experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating
new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases,
multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various
vision models for image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的模型（7T-Restormer），用于从常规1.5T或3T T1加权图像合成7T质量的T1图，解决了7T MRI成本高且稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI具有更高的分辨率和对比度，但成本高且存在技术挑战。通过合成7T质量的图像，可以使其更广泛地应用于临床。

Method: 使用141例患者数据（1.5T和3T T1W图像配对的7T T1图），训练并验证7T-Restormer模型，并与ResViT和ResShift模型对比。

Result: 7T-Restormer在1.5T和3T输入下均表现优异，PSNR和SSIM显著优于其他模型，且参数更少。混合训练策略优于单一训练。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效合成7T质量的图像，为临床工作流程提供了更便捷的7T MRI替代方案。

Abstract: Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over
standard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly,
scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.
We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize
7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:
Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding
7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128
slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),
19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145
slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,
respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and
ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-
4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,
and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using
10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter
ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter
ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T
(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus
was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T
increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely
on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We
propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T
and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.
Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical
workflows.

Conclusion: 深度感知提示在零训练设置下有效，方法轻量且兼容黑盒MLLMs。

Abstract: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel
prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves
spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It
segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular
depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded
vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to
the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs
to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is
lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on
hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show
consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of
depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

Motivation: 地球系统观测（ESO）中存在高类间相似性、场景杂乱和模糊边界等挑战，现有对比学习框架难以应对多标签和跨模态的语义精确性问题。

Method: 提出MoSAiC框架，结合多标签监督对比损失，联合优化模态内和模态间的对比学习。

Conclusion: MoSAiC在多模态卫星影像中实现了更精细的语义解耦和更鲁棒的表征学习。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning
transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets.
Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data
samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These
strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO),
where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer
naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents
unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and
ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in
low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on
intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment
and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a
unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive
learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically
for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic
disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally
similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets,
BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both
fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster
coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

(CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial
computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability
across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation
approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with
Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection
strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while
substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability.
This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for
muscle segmentation in clinical and research applications.

*Li Li,Yingzhe Peng,Xu Yang,Ruoxi Cheng,Haiyang Xu,Ming Yan,Fei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于轻量级CLIP（L-CLIP）的新颖嵌入式字幕评估指标L-CLIPScore，用于高效评估字幕质量和训练字幕模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有字幕评估方法在效率和资源消耗上存在不足，需要一种轻量且高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过权重复用和矩阵分解压缩CLIP架构，并设计多模态相似性调节器（SR）损失进行知识蒸馏。

Result: L-CLIP在保持多模态对齐能力的同时，显著减少了计算资源和运行时间。实验验证了L-CLIPScore的高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: L-CLIPScore作为字幕评估指标表现优异，但训练字幕模型时需与n-gram指标结合使用以避免训练失败。

Abstract: We propose a novel embedding-based captioning metric termed as L-CLIPScore
that can be used for efficiently evaluating caption quality and training
captioning model. L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP),
which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To
compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and
matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding
matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity
Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge.
Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the
given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is
non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP
achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it
requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive
experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when
using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when
using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be
mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore
only will cause fail training.

TL;DR: SGPMIL是一种基于稀疏高斯过程的概率注意力MIL框架，通过量化实例相关性中的不确定性，提高了预测的可靠性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统MIL方法中实例级注意力分数缺乏不确定性量化的问题。

Method: 提出SGPMIL框架，利用稀疏高斯过程学习注意力分数的后验分布，并引入特征缩放优化训练效率。

Result: 在多个数字病理数据集上，SGPMIL在袋级和实例级评估中均表现优异。

Conclusion: SGPMIL不仅保持了袋级性能，还显著提升了不确定性下的实例级预测质量。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where
only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to
instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology,
which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based
MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the
uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack
of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing
\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in
Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over
attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting
in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only
preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the
quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty.
SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive
mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced
instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established
digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across
both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: 介绍了RoundaboutHD，一个高分辨率多摄像头车辆跟踪数据集，填补现有数据集的不足，支持智能城市应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公开数据集过于简单，无法满足真实场景需求，阻碍学术研究与实际应用的结合。

Method: 创建RoundaboutHD数据集，包含40分钟4K分辨率视频，512辆车的标注数据，支持多种任务。

Result: 提供了车辆检测、单摄像头跟踪、车辆重识别和多摄像头跟踪的基线结果。

Conclusion: RoundaboutHD为多摄像头车辆跟踪研究提供了更接近真实场景的数据支持。

Abstract: The multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) framework holds significant
potential for smart city applications, including anomaly detection, traffic
density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, current publicly
available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios,
low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a
considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill
this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution
multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to
represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40
minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping,
high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle
identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich
cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video
footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear
movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several
subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and
image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information
and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further
analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera
tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于谱总变分（STV）特征的弱学习器集成方法，解决计算机视觉中训练数据不足的问题，并在医学影像任务中表现优于深度学习和Radiomics。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉任务中常面临训练数据不足的问题，需要一种有效的方法来提升模型性能。

Method: 利用STV特征构建弱学习器集成，STV特征能有效表征多尺度纹理，且特征间相关性低。

Result: 在医学影像任务中，STV集成方法（AUC=0.87）优于神经网络（AUC=0.75）和Radiomics（AUC=0.79）。

Conclusion: STV特征集成方法在数据不足时表现优异，尤其是CT图像中的精细STV尺度对PET高摄取预测有显著指示作用。

Abstract: Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often
encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the
use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)
features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of
the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various
scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,
orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are
empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of
lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using
learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we
examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of
computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography
(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of
457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach
is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV
learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and
Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are
especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.

Motivation: 现有交通数字孪生依赖静态地图或高成本传感器，缺乏可扩展性和适应性，且多源数据集成面临隐私和效率挑战。

Method: 提出Geo-ORBIT框架，包括轻量级车道检测模型GeoLane、个性化参数学习的Meta-GeoLane，以及联邦学习策略FedMeta-GeoLane。

Result: FedMeta-GeoLane在几何误差和泛化能力上优于基线方法，显著降低通信开销。

Conclusion: Geo-ORBIT为灵活、上下文感知的基础设施建模奠定了基础。

Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and
operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation
systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making.
A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry
sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly
sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs
that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,
communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we
introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated
Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT
synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is
GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from
vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through
Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local
entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures
scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our
system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that
renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive
experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently
outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric
error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically
reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible,
context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly
available at https://github.com/raynbowy23/FedMeta-GeoLane.git.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在遥感图像多粒度层次分类中存在局限性，无法生成端到端的多粒度预测，且跨域任务迁移研究不足。

Method: 提出HieraRS方法，包含BHCCM机制和TransLU框架，支持多粒度预测和跨域迁移。

Result: 构建了MM-5B数据集，HieraRS提升了语义一致性和分类精度。

Conclusion: HieraRS为遥感图像层次分类和跨域任务迁移提供了灵活且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Hierarchical land cover and land use (LCLU) classification aims to assign
pixel-wise labels with multiple levels of semantic granularity to remote
sensing (RS) imagery. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two
major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,
which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity
hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in
practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused
by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop
classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of
LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables
multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We
introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism
(BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification
models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic
consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a
dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components:
Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment
(CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the
effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition,
we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset
featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released
at: https://github.com/AI-Tianlong/HieraRS.

TL;DR: Birkhoff是一种无需数据的压缩算法，专为Segment Anything Model (SAM)及其变体设计，具有高效压缩和快速推理的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SAM及其变体在零样本分割中的优异表现，压缩这些模型成为实际需求。

Method: Birkhoff提出Hyper-Compression算法，将高维参数向量转为低维标量，并设计HyperLinear加速推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上，Birkhoff在压缩时间、压缩比、性能和推理速度上表现优异，例如5.17x压缩比且性能下降小于1%。

Conclusion: Birkhoff是一种高效、通用的压缩方法，适用于SAM及其变体，无需微调数据即可快速完成压缩。

Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot
segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely
applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing
practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free
compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning,
distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility
across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,
and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel
compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a
dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a
low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer
operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to
significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive
experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff
performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio,
post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can
achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance
drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished
within 60 seconds for all models.

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the
MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well
Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional
features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific
prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a
multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification
by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class
assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass
variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an
interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through
systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the
model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images,
demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings
highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype
coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications
in pattern recognition.

Conclusion: CoPart通过部分分解和关系建模，显著提升了3D生成的细节表现和可控性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D
rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit
geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations
persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part
geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects
part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3)
Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by
human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework
that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part
generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding
complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship
modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual
guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part
latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model
priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D
part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and
human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior
capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene
composition with unprecedented controllability.

Motivation: 现有自回归视频生成器存在架构偏离、依赖外部编码器或高延迟问题，Lumos-1旨在保留LLM架构的同时提升性能。

Method: 提出MM-RoPE改进3D位置编码，并设计AR-DF策略解决帧间损失不平衡问题。

Result: 在48个GPU上预训练，性能媲美EMU3、COSMOS-Video2World和OpenSoraPlan。

Conclusion: Lumos-1通过轻量级改进和高效训练，实现了高性能的自回归视频生成。

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of
language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video
generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from
standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur
prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce
Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture
with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations
in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its
imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE
scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive
frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal
spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy
that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.
Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss
imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing
Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal
tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to
avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we
pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on
GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code

Motivation: 传统渲染方法在数据压缩和计算效率上存在不足，CLiFT旨在通过压缩令牌实现高效渲染，同时保持场景的丰富外观和几何信息。

Method: 使用多视图编码器将图像和相机姿态转换为令牌，通过潜在空间K均值选择代表性射线作为聚类中心，构建压缩光场令牌（CLiFTs）。测试时根据目标视角和计算预算动态调整令牌数量进行渲染。

Result: 在RealEstate10K和DL3DV数据集上的实验表明，CLiFT在数据压缩、渲染质量和速度之间实现了最佳平衡，并取得了最高的综合渲染评分。

Conclusion: CLiFT提供了一种高效且灵活的神经渲染方法，能够在保持高质量渲染的同时显著减少数据量和计算开销。

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as
"compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and
geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by
compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to
represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely,
given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera
poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids
using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of
all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time,
given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the
system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel
view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K
and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach,
achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the
highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size,
rendering quality, and rendering speed.

Result: 在未包含情感披露的冰岛语语音模型上，该方法提高了模型的整体可控性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了模型的不可控变化问题，提升了控制能力。

Abstract: A Prompt-based Text-To-Speech model allows a user to control different
aspects of speech, such as speaking rate and perceived gender, through natural
language instruction. Although user-friendly, such approaches are on one hand
constrained: control is limited to acoustic features exposed to the model
during training, and too flexible on the other: the same inputs yields
uncontrollable variation that are reflected in the corpus statistics.
  We investigate a novel fine-tuning regime to address both of these issues at
the same time by exploiting the uncontrollable variance of the model. Through
principal component analysis of thousands of synthesised samples, we determine
latent features that account for the highest proportion of the output variance
and incorporate them as new labels for secondary fine-tuning. We evaluate the
proposed methods on two models trained on an expressive Icelandic speech
corpus, one with emotional disclosure and one without. In the case of the model
without emotional disclosure, the method yields both continuous and discrete
features that improve overall controllability of the model.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven
bypretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT. Thesemodels excel
at understanding complex texts, but biomedical literature, withits
domain-specific terminology, poses challenges that models likeWord2Vec and

### [74] [Mass-Scale Analysis of In-the-Wild Conversations Reveals Complexity Bounds on LLM Jailbreaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08014)
*Aldan Creo,Raul Castro Fernandez,Manuel Cebrian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，越狱攻击的复杂性并未显著高于正常对话，且攻击毒性保持稳定，而AI防御机制在改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解越狱策略的复杂性及其演变对AI安全至关重要。

Method: 通过分析200多万真实对话，使用概率度量、词汇多样性等指标评估复杂性。

Result: 越狱攻击复杂性未显著提高，防御机制改进，攻击毒性稳定。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了攻击与防御升级的叙事，指出AI安全受限于人类创造力，同时警告学术披露可能破坏现有平衡。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed, understanding
the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies is critical for AI
safety.
  We present a mass-scale empirical analysis of jailbreak complexity across
over 2 million real-world conversations from diverse platforms, including
dedicated jailbreaking communities and general-purpose chatbots. Using a range
of complexity metrics spanning probabilistic measures, lexical diversity,
compression ratios, and cognitive load indicators, we find that jailbreak
attempts do not exhibit significantly higher complexity than normal
conversations. This pattern holds consistently across specialized jailbreaking
communities and general user populations, suggesting practical bounds on attack
sophistication. Temporal analysis reveals that while user attack toxicity and
complexity remains stable over time, assistant response toxicity has decreased,
indicating improving safety mechanisms. The absence of power-law scaling in
complexity distributions further points to natural limits on jailbreak
development.
  Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative of an escalating arms race
between attackers and defenders, instead suggesting that LLM safety evolution
is bounded by human ingenuity constraints while defensive measures continue
advancing. Our results highlight critical information hazards in academic
jailbreak disclosure, as sophisticated attacks exceeding current complexity
baselines could disrupt the observed equilibrium and enable widespread harm
before defensive adaptation.

*Prudence Djagba,Chimezie A. Odinakachukwu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinGPT在金融NLP任务中表现优异，尤其在分类任务（如情感分析和标题分类）上接近GPT-4，但在推理和生成任务（如问答和摘要）上表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估FinGPT在金融领域的实际应用能力，为未来研究提供基准。

Method: 在六个金融NLP任务上测试FinGPT，使用金融专用数据集，并与GPT-4和人类基准对比。

Result: FinGPT在分类任务中表现强，接近GPT-4；在推理和生成任务中表现较差，尤其在数值准确性和复杂推理上。

Conclusion: FinGPT适用于结构化金融任务，但需进一步优化架构和领域适应性，以提升综合能力。

Abstract: This work evaluates FinGPT, a financial domain-specific language model,
across six key natural language processing (NLP) tasks: Sentiment Analysis,
Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Financial Question Answering,
Text Summarization, and Stock Movement Prediction. The evaluation uses
finance-specific datasets to assess FinGPT's capabilities and limitations in
real-world financial applications. The results show that FinGPT performs
strongly in classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and headline
categorization, often achieving results comparable to GPT-4. However, its
performance is significantly lower in tasks that involve reasoning and
generation, such as financial question answering and summarization. Comparisons
with GPT-4 and human benchmarks highlight notable performance gaps,
particularly in numerical accuracy and complex reasoning. Overall, the findings
indicate that while FinGPT is effective for certain structured financial tasks,
it is not yet a comprehensive solution. This research provides a useful
benchmark for future research and underscores the need for architectural
improvements and domain-specific optimization in financial language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战LLMs仅依赖表面统计的观点，探索其内部结构与机器理解的关系。

Method: 提出三层级的机器理解理论：概念理解、世界状态理解和原则性理解，并通过MI研究验证。

Result: LLMs形成类似理解的结构，但其认知机制与人类不同。

Conclusion: 应关注LLMs的独特认知机制，而非争论其是否理解。

Abstract: Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the
inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these
models rely solely on superficial statistics. Here, we offer an accessible
synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI, all while
integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking
about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures
that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in
seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception
of machine understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model
forms "features" as directions in latent space, thereby learning the
connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second,
state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual
connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world.
Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a
collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" that connects these
facts. However, we conclude by exploring the "parallel mechanisms" phenomenon,
arguing that while LLMs exhibit forms of understanding, their cognitive
architecture remains different from ours, and the debate should shift from
whether LLMs understand to how their strange minds work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决迭代文本生成中模型高效识别和纠正自身错误的问题。

Method: 利用Process Reward Model（PRM）评估生成块，根据PRM分数动态调整掩码比例，针对性优化低分部分。

Result: 通过针对性优化，显著提升最终生成文本的质量。

Conclusion: R3是一种简单有效的框架，能够显著提升预训练模型的文本生成能力。

Abstract: A key challenge for iterative text generation is enabling models to
efficiently identify and correct their own errors. We propose Review, Remask,
Refine (R3), a relatively simple yet elegant framework that requires no
additional model training and can be applied to any pre-trained masked text
diffusion model (e.g., LLaDA or BD3-LM). In R3, a Process Reward Model (PRM) is
utilized for the Review of intermediate generated blocks. The framework then
translates these PRM scores into a Remask strategy: the lower a block's PRM
score, indicating potential mistakes, the greater the proportion of tokens
within that block are remasked. Finally, the model is compelled to Refine these
targeted segments, focusing its efforts more intensively on specific
sub-optimal parts of past generations, leading to improved final output.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解LLMs在简历筛选中的表现是否一致，以及其与人类专家的差异，为自动化招聘系统提供参考。

Method: 使用控制数据集测试三种LLMs（Claude、GPT、Gemini）在不同上下文中的表现，并与三位人类招聘专家对比。

Result: LLMs在部分条件下表现显著差异，且与人类专家在所有上下文中均存在显著差异。GPT对上下文适应最强，Gemini次之，Claude最弱。

Conclusion: LLMs在详细提示下表现出可解释的模式，但与人类判断存在显著差异，需谨慎应用于自动化招聘。

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit
consistent behavior (signal) or random variation (noise) when screening resumes
against job descriptions, and how their performance compares to human experts.
Using controlled datasets, we tested three LLMs (Claude, GPT, and Gemini)
across contexts (No Company, Firm1 [MNC], Firm2 [Startup], Reduced Context)
with identical and randomized resumes, benchmarked against three human
recruitment experts. Analysis of variance revealed significant mean differences
in four of eight LLM-only conditions and consistently significant differences
between LLM and human evaluations (p < 0.01). Paired t-tests showed GPT adapts
strongly to company context (p < 0.001), Gemini partially (p = 0.038 for
Firm1), and Claude minimally (p > 0.1), while all LLMs differed significantly
from human experts across contexts. Meta-cognition analysis highlighted
adaptive weighting patterns that differ markedly from human evaluation
approaches. Findings suggest LLMs offer interpretable patterns with detailed
prompts but diverge substantially from human judgment, informing their
deployment in automated hiring systems.

TL;DR: ETTA框架通过线性变换识别并减弱嵌入空间中的毒性敏感维度，成功攻击多个LLM，揭示了当前对齐策略的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的开放性和嵌入空间中毒攻击的潜在威胁，促使研究更精准的对抗扰动技术。

Method: 提出ETTA框架，通过线性变换操作嵌入空间，无需微调或访问训练数据。

Result: 在五个开源LLM上平均攻击成功率达88.61%，优于基线11.34%。

Conclusion: ETTA揭示了嵌入空间对齐的脆弱性，呼吁开发嵌入感知的防御机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
such as healthcare, education, and cybersecurity. However, this openness also
introduces significant security risks, particularly through embedding space
poisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the
internal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment
mechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation
methods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain
insufficiently understood. Consequently, more targeted and accurate adversarial
perturbation techniques, which pose significant threats, have not been
adequately studied.
  In this work, we propose ETTA (Embedding Transformation Toxicity
Attenuation), a novel framework that identifies and attenuates
toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space via linear transformations.
ETTA bypasses model refusal behaviors while preserving linguistic coherence,
without requiring model fine-tuning or access to training data. Evaluated on
five representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA
achieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best
baseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR
on instruction-tuned defenses). These results highlight a critical
vulnerability in current alignment strategies and underscore the need for
embedding-aware defenses.

Conclusion: 本文通过双重视角（外部和内部）理解多模态ICL，提出的方法和指标可应用于更广泛的研究领域。

Abstract: The evolution of large models has witnessed the emergence of In-Context
Learning (ICL) capabilities. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of
Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration
configuration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the
controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and
cost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of
LMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and
internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image
captioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies
through three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.
We employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and
summarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention
characteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model
behaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of
attention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare
performance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining
strategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data
features. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model
performance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns
through internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding
multimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis
to investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be
applied to broader research areas.

Motivation: 探讨LLM政治倾向的成因及影响，区分偏见与合理认知差异。

Method: 使用道德基础理论、政治意识形态量表和争议指数分析七种主流LLM。

Result: 多数模型优先体现自由主义价值观（如关怀与公平），微调会增强这一倾向。

Conclusion: 自由主义倾向是训练数据的自然结果，可能反映集体推理的新视角。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed a consistent liberal orientation in the ethical
and political responses generated by most commercial large language models
(LLMs), yet the underlying causes and resulting implications remain unclear.
This paper systematically investigates the political temperament of seven
prominent LLMs - OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, Perplexity
(Sonar Large), Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta AI's Llama 4, Mistral 7b Le Chat
and High-Flyer's DeepSeek R1 -- using a multi-pronged approach that includes
Moral Foundations Theory, a dozen established political ideology scales and a
new index of current political controversies. We find strong and consistent
prioritization of liberal-leaning values, particularly care and fairness,
across most models. Further analysis attributes this trend to four overlapping
factors: Liberal-leaning training corpora, reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), the dominance of liberal frameworks in academic ethical
discourse and safety-driven fine-tuning practices. We also distinguish between
political "bias" and legitimate epistemic differences, cautioning against
conflating the two. A comparison of base and fine-tuned model pairs reveals
that fine-tuning generally increases liberal lean, an effect confirmed through
both self-report and empirical testing. We argue that this "liberal tilt" is
not a programming error or the personal preference of programmers but an
emergent property of training on democratic rights-focused discourse. Finally,
we propose that LLMs may indirectly echo John Rawls' famous veil-of ignorance
philosophical aspiration, reflecting a moral stance unanchored to personal
identity or interest. Rather than undermining democratic discourse, this
pattern may offer a new lens through which to examine collective reasoning.

Result: AI辅助流程通过率提高20个百分点，后续就业率提高5.9个百分点，但倾向于选择年轻且经验少的候选人。

Conclusion: AI技术显著影响招聘决策，但也带来潜在的选择偏好问题。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in recruitment, yet
empirical evidence quantifying its impact on hiring efficiency and candidate
selection remains limited. We randomly assign 37,000 applicants for a
junior-developer position to either a traditional recruitment process (resume
screening followed by human selection) or an AI-assisted recruitment pipeline
incorporating an initial AI-driven structured video interview before human
evaluation. Candidates advancing from either track faced the same final-stage
human interview, with interviewers blind to the earlier selection method. In
the AI-assisted pipeline, 54% of candidates passed the final interview compared
with 34% from the traditional pipeline, yielding an average treatment effect of
20 percentage points (SE 12 pp.). Five months later, we collected LinkedIn
profiles of top applicants from both groups and found that 18% (SE 1.1%) of
applicants from the traditional track found new jobs compared with 23% (SE
2.3%) from the AI group, resulting in a 5.9 pp. (SE 2.6 pp.) difference in the
probability of finding new employment between groups. The AI system tended to
select younger applicants with less experience and fewer advanced credentials.
We analyze AI-generated interview transcripts to examine the selection criteria
and conversational dynamics. Our findings contribute to understanding how AI
technologies affect decision making in recruitment and talent acquisition while
highlighting some of their potential implications.

Motivation: 评估生成式AI模型在医疗领域输出中免责声明的使用情况，以提醒用户AI输出未经专业审核，不能替代医疗建议。

Method: 使用500份乳腺X光片、500份胸部X光片、500份皮肤病图像和500个医学问题，筛查模型输出中的免责声明短语。

Result: 免责声明在LLM和VLM输出中的比例从2022年的26.3%和2023年的19.6%分别降至2025年的0.97%和1.05%。

Conclusion: 随着模型能力增强，免责声明需作为适应临床环境的保障措施重新实施。

Abstract: Generative AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used to interpret medical
images and answer clinical questions. Their responses often include
inaccuracies; therefore, safety measures like medical disclaimers are critical
to remind users that AI outputs are not professionally vetted or a substitute
for medical advice. This study evaluated the presence of disclaimers in LLM and
VLM outputs across model generations from 2022 to 2025. Using 500 mammograms,
500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions, outputs
were screened for disclaimer phrases. Medical disclaimer presence in LLM and
VLM outputs dropped from 26.3% in 2022 to 0.97% in 2025, and from 19.6% in 2023
to 1.05% in 2025, respectively. By 2025, the majority of models displayed no
disclaimers. As public models become more capable and authoritative,
disclaimers must be implemented as a safeguard adapting to the clinical context
of each output.

Abstract: The emergence of Small Language Models (SLMs) as privacy-preserving
alternatives for sensitive applications raises a fundamental question about
their inherent understanding capabilities compared to Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper investigates the mental health understanding capabilities of
current SLMs through systematic evaluation across diverse classification tasks.
Employing zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms, we benchmark their
performance against established LLM baselines to elucidate their relative
strengths and limitations in this critical domain. We assess five
state-of-the-art SLMs (Phi-3, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.2, Gemma2) against
three LLMs (GPT-4, FLAN-T5-XXL, Alpaca-7B) on six mental health understanding
tasks. Our findings reveal that SLMs achieve mean performance within 2\% of
LLMs on binary classification tasks (F1 scores of 0.64 vs 0.66 in zero-shot
settings), demonstrating notable competence despite orders of magnitude fewer
parameters. Both model categories experience similar degradation on multi-class
severity tasks (a drop of over 30\%), suggesting that nuanced clinical
understanding challenges transcend model scale. Few-shot prompting provides
substantial improvements for SLMs (up to 14.6\%), while LLM gains are more
variable. Our work highlights the potential of SLMs in mental health
understanding, showing they can be effective privacy-preserving tools for
analyzing sensitive online text data. In particular, their ability to quickly
adapt and specialize with minimal data through few-shot learning positions them
as promising candidates for scalable mental health screening tools.

Motivation: LLM在缺乏上下文信息时可能生成低质量回答或幻觉内容，需要外部工具提供实时数据以提高准确性。

Method: 开发了一个框架，通过访问外部API获取额外信息，并集成计算工具（如计算器、日历）。

Result: 在MMLU数据集上测试，Athena框架在数学推理和科学推理上分别达到83%和88%的准确率，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建围绕LLM的复杂计算生态系统铺平了道路，使其更自然地支持多样化任务。

Abstract: This paper deals with improving querying large language models (LLMs). It is
well-known that without relevant contextual information, LLMs can provide poor
quality responses or tend to hallucinate. Several initiatives have proposed
integrating LLMs with external tools to provide them with up-to-date data to
improve accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate external
tools to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in answering queries in educational
settings. Precisely, we develop a framework that allows accessing external APIs
to request additional relevant information. Integrated tools can also provide
computational capabilities such as calculators or calendars. The proposed
framework has been evaluated using datasets from the Multi-Modal Language
Understanding (MMLU) collection. The data consists of questions on mathematical
and scientific reasoning. Results compared to state-of-the-art language models
show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance. Our Athena
framework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific
reasoning, substantially outperforming all tested models including GPT-4o,
LLaMA-Large, Mistral-Large, Phi-Large, and GPT-3.5, with the best baseline
model (LLaMA-Large) achieving only 67% and 79% respectively. These promising
results open the way to creating complex computing ecosystems around LLMs to
make their use more natural to support various tasks and activities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估MedVQA在临床工作流程中的实际应用价值，识别其挑战和差距，以促进其更好地服务于医疗诊断。

Method: 采用Arksey和O'Malley的范围综述框架，结合文献综述和临床医生调查，分析MedVQA的现状和临床需求。

Result: 研究发现60%的问答对缺乏临床相关性，数据集和模型不支持多视图、多分辨率成像等关键功能，且评估指标与临床需求不匹配。临床医生中仅29.8%认为MedVQA高度有用。

Conclusion: MedVQA虽具潜力，但需解决多模态分析不足、缺乏患者背景等问题，以实现有效的临床整合。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist
radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question
answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into
clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68
publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to
examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey
and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1)
reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in
radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives
on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs
are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not
support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain
knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a
clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The
clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems
highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain
knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the
need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models
focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based
interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as
limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation
approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.

Motivation: 现有方法假设大语言模型仅通过少样本提示即可生成有效计划，但实际效果有限，需要更强推理能力解决复杂问题。

Method: 引入CRISP数据集，包含数学推理和代码生成的高层计划，通过自动生成和严格验证（内在和外在评估），并微调小模型。

Result: 微调小模型生成的计划质量优于大模型少样本提示，且显著优于链式思维推理，跨领域评估显示泛化能力强。

Conclusion: CRISP证明了微调小模型在计划生成中的有效性，并展示了跨领域的泛化潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for
stronger reasoning capabilities to solve complex problems effectively. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been a step forward, it remains
insufficient for many domains. A promising alternative is explicit high-level
plan generation, but existing approaches largely assume that LLMs can produce
effective plans through few-shot prompting alone, without additional training.
In this work, we challenge this assumption and introduce CRISP (Complex
Reasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans), a multi-domain dataset of
high-level plans for mathematical reasoning and code generation. The plans in
CRISP are automatically generated and rigorously validated--both intrinsically,
using an LLM as a judge, and extrinsically, by evaluating their impact on
downstream task performance. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a small model on
CRISP enables it to generate higher-quality plans than much larger models using
few-shot prompting, while significantly outperforming Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Furthermore, our out-of-domain evaluation reveals that fine-tuning
on one domain improves plan generation in the other, highlighting the
generalizability of learned planning capabilities.

Abstract: Autonomous agents built on language models (LMs) are showing increasing
popularity in many fields, including scientific research. AI co-scientists aim
to support or automate parts of the research process using these agents. A key
component of empirical AI research is the design of ablation experiments. To
this end, we introduce AblationBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents
on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research. It includes two tasks:
AuthorAblation, which helps authors propose ablation experiments based on a
method section and contains 83 instances, and ReviewerAblation, which helps
reviewers find missing ablations in a full paper and contains 350 instances.
For both tasks, we develop LM-based judges that serve as an automatic
evaluation framework. Our experiments with frontier LMs show that these tasks
remain challenging, with the best-performing LM system identifying only 29% of
the original ablations on average. Lastly, we analyze the limitations of
current LMs on these tasks, and find that chain-of-thought prompting
outperforms the currently existing agent-based approach.

TL;DR: Krul是一个多轮LLM推理系统，通过动态选择压缩策略和优化KV缓存恢复，显著提升了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多轮对话中KV缓存恢复的效率和准确性问题，避免固定压缩策略导致的性能下降。

Method: 动态选择压缩策略、引入预选压缩策略选择器、令牌级异构注意力相似性估计器和无气泡恢复调度器。

Result: 在真实任务中，Krul将TTFT降低1.5x-2.68x，KV缓存存储减少1.33x-2.35x，且不影响生成质量。

Conclusion: Krul通过动态策略和优化恢复流程，显著提升了多轮对话中KV缓存恢复的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language
models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of
recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To
address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers
with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a
fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer
pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention
dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern
similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable
accuracy degradation.
  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and
efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies
based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a
recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key
innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical
context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the
conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to
mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model
generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles
brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV
caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul
achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x
reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without
compromising generation quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需微调的方法，利用大语言模型从自然语言问题或关键词查询生成SPARQL查询，通过策略性执行查询和搜索相关IRI与字面量，在多种知识图谱和基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从自然语言生成SPARQL查询的挑战，避免对语言模型进行微调，同时适应不同规模和类型的知识图谱。

Method: 利用大语言模型探索知识图谱，策略性执行SPARQL查询并搜索相关IRI与字面量，支持零样本设置。

Result: 在Wikidata上达到SOTA结果，在Freebase上接近最佳少样本方法，其他知识图谱和基准测试中表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法在零样本设置下表现优异，适用于多种知识图谱，且无需微调，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We propose a new approach for generating SPARQL queries on RDF knowledge
graphs from natural language questions or keyword queries, using a large
language model. Our approach does not require fine-tuning. Instead, it uses the
language model to explore the knowledge graph by strategically executing SPARQL
queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals. We evaluate our approach
on a variety of benchmarks (for knowledge graphs of different kinds and sizes)
and language models (of different scales and types, commercial as well as
open-source) and compare it with existing approaches. On Wikidata we reach
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, despite the zero-shot setting.
On Freebase we come close to the best few-shot methods. On other, less commonly
evaluated knowledge graphs and benchmarks our approach also performs well
overall. We conduct several additional studies, like comparing different ways
of searching the graphs, incorporating a feedback mechanism, or making use of
few-shot examples.

Motivation: 尽管语言模型在文本处理任务中具有潜力，但其实际应用受到安全性、可解释性和偏见等问题的限制。论文旨在负责任地利用语言模型，减少风险并支持人类专家决策。

Method: 提出一个框架，将LM子程序封装为可调用的函数，记录所有LM生成的工件（如提示、输入、输出和数据依赖），并支持审计。框架以库的形式提供，便于采用和持续开发。

Conclusion: 该框架为透明、可审计地使用语言模型提供了可行方案，适用于多个实际决策工作流程，如医疗和法律领域。

Abstract: The advent of language models (LMs) has the potential to dramatically
accelerate tasks that may be cast to text-processing; however, real-world
adoption is hindered by concerns regarding safety, explainability, and bias.
How can we responsibly leverage LMs in a transparent, auditable manner --
minimizing risk and allowing human experts to focus on informed decision-making
rather than data-processing or prompt engineering? In this work, we propose a
framework for declaring statically typed, LM-powered subroutines (i.e.,
callable, function-like procedures) for use within conventional asynchronous
code -- such that sparse feedback from human experts is used to improve the
performance of each subroutine online (i.e., during use). In our
implementation, all LM-produced artifacts (i.e., prompts, inputs, outputs, and
data-dependencies) are recorded and exposed to audit on demand. We package this
framework as a library to support its adoption and continued development. While
this framework may be applicable across several real-world decision workflows
(e.g., in healthcare and legal fields), we evaluate it in the context of public
comment processing as mandated by the 1969 National Environmental Protection
Act (NEPA): Specifically, we use this framework to develop "CommentNEPA," an
application that compiles, organizes, and summarizes a corpus of public
commentary submitted in response to a project requiring environmental review.
We quantitatively evaluate the application by comparing its outputs (when
operating without human feedback) to historical ``ground-truth'' data as
labelled by human annotators during the preparation of official environmental
impact statements.

*Vivek Chari,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Compactor是一种无需参数、查询无关的KV缓存压缩策略，通过近似杠杆分数确定令牌重要性，显著减少内存占用，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs中KV缓存内存占用高的问题，提高吞吐量并降低服务成本。

Method: 使用近似杠杆分数进行令牌重要性评估，实现KV缓存压缩，并引入上下文校准压缩技术。

Result: 在合成和真实任务中，Compactor保留一半令牌，内存负担减少63%，性能与竞争方法相当。

Conclusion: Compactor是一种高效、通用的KV缓存压缩方法，适用于多种任务和模型。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very
large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in
generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,
which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often
the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput
and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV
cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked
(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present
Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses
approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that
Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining
1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal
computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated
compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given
context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that
Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV
memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and
real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5
and Llama 3.1 families.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从大型语言模型（LLM）到小型语言模型（SLM）的知识蒸馏方法，重点保留共情能力，通过两步微调和针对性提示显著提升SLM的共情表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限但人机交互频繁的场景（如智能手机）中，SLM需保留LLM的共情能力，以确保良好用户体验。

Method: 采用两步微调过程，利用LLM生成的共情对话数据集，并设计四组针对性提示以优化共情蒸馏。

Result: 实验表明，该方法使SLM生成共情回应的胜率达到90%，较基础提示方法提升10%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了SLM的共情能力，为资源受限场景下的高质量人机交互提供了解决方案。

Abstract: The distillation of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) into Smaller
Language Models (SLMs), preserving the capabilities and performance of LLMs
while reducing model size, has played a key role in the proliferation of LLMs.
Because SLMs are considerably smaller than LLMs, they are often utilized in
domains where human interaction is frequent but resources are highly
constrained, e.g., smart phones. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that
empathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled
into LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation. In this paper, we develop a
comprehensive approach for effective empathy distillation from LLMs into SLMs.
Our approach features a two-step fine-tuning process that fully leverages
datasets of empathetic dialogue responses distilled from LLMs. We explore
several distillation methods beyond basic direct prompting and propose four
unique sets of prompts for targeted empathy improvement to significantly
enhance the empathy distillation process. Our evaluations demonstrate that SLMs
fine-tuned through the two-step fine-tuning process with distillation datasets
enhanced by the targeted empathy improvement prompts significantly outperform
the base SLM at generating empathetic responses with a win rate of 90%. Our
targeted empathy improvement prompts substantially outperform the basic direct
prompting with a 10% improvement in win rate.

Conclusion: TruthTorchLM为真实性预测研究提供了全面且可扩展的工具，支持未来方法扩展。

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs)inevitably produce untruthful
responses. Accurately predicting the truthfulness of these outputs is critical,
especially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and
make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM
an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness
prediction methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing
toolkits such as Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded
verification, or LM-Polygraph, which is limited to uncertainty-based methods,
TruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These
methods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g.,
black-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type
(self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with
both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based
models. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation,
calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible
framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation
of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and
FactScore-Bio. The code is available at https://github.com/Ybakman/TruthTorchLM

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，LLMs的OOCR现象源于LoRA微调添加的恒定导向向量，而非学习浅层启发式。这种导向向量能提升任务性能并引发跨领域泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在微调后表现出的OOCR现象背后的机制，以理解其为何能在分布外泛化。

Method: 通过LoRA微调分析OOCR现象，并尝试直接训练导向向量验证其效果。

Result: 发现恒定导向向量足以解释OOCR现象，甚至适用于需条件行为的任务（如后门）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了微调过程中学习的内容，为LLMs的OOCR能力提供了机制性解释，对其安全可靠部署有重要意义。

Abstract: Out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is a phenomenon in which fine-tuned LLMs
exhibit surprisingly deep out-of-distribution generalization. Rather than
learning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the
consequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this
work, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many
instances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA
fine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model
towards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task
and in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising
generalization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these
tasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even
for a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model
backdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is
sufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned
during fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs
can reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to
their safe and reliable deployment.

Motivation: 验证LLMs作为代理学生是否能准确模拟真实学生的行为和特征，为智能辅导系统和试题测试提供可靠依据。

Method: 收集489项NAEP数据，应用IRT模型将11种LLMs与真实学生能力对标，并测试不同提示对模型表现的影响。

Result: 强通用模型普遍优于学生平均水平，但模型和提示的匹配性因学科和年级而异，无模型能完全符合要求。

Conclusion: 需开发新训练和评估策略，并基于研究结果提供代理选择的指导原则。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the
development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and in piloting test
questions. However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the
behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To
investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading
comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory
(IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same
ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without
guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average
student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align
incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but
whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model-
and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across
subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation
strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable
proxies based on our findings.

Conclusion: 性别在疼痛体验中起重要作用，未来研究应更多关注性别因素。

Abstract: Pain is an inherent part of human existence, manifesting as both physical and
emotional experiences, and can be categorized as either acute or chronic. Over
the years, extensive research has been conducted to understand the causes of
pain and explore potential treatments, with contributions from various
scientific disciplines. However, earlier studies often overlooked the role of
gender in pain experiences. In this study, we utilized Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to analyze and gain deeper insights into individuals' pain
experiences, with a particular focus on gender differences. We successfully
classified posts into male and female corpora using the Hidden Attribute
Model-Convolutional Neural Network (HAM-CNN), achieving an F1 score of 0.86 by
aggregating posts based on usernames. Our analysis revealed linguistic
differences between genders, with female posts tending to be more emotionally
focused. Additionally, the study highlighted that conditions such as migraine
and sinusitis are more prevalent among females and explored how pain medication
affects individuals differently based on gender.

Result: KAT在多个基准测试中表现优异，token使用减少30%，并在实际应用中提升了开发效率。

Abstract: We present Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), an open-source 40B large language model
developed to address the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks,
where an automatic thinking training paradigm is proposed to dynamically switch
between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity.
Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel
tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling
efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost.
Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces
mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting.
Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that
incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering
structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT
consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models,
including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of
reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately
30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in
Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world
development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable
reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage
results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and
efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在文档图像任务中表现优异，但在跨模态和跨语言的文档图像机器翻译任务中存在挑战，且传统微调方法会导致模型遗忘原有能力。

Method: 提出SSR（同步自检）方法，让模型在生成翻译文本前先生成OCR文本，以利用其OCR能力并学习跨语言翻译。

Result: 实验表明SSR能有效缓解灾难性遗忘，提升模型在OCR和文档图像机器翻译任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSR方法为多模态大语言模型的微调提供了一种新思路，显著提升了其在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However,
they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires
handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to
enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT
dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual
abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR
proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage".
Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing
translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR
ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商家在私域渠道中缺乏撰写有说服力消息的专业知识和工具，CRMAgent旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过三种模式：基于群组的学习、检索与适应、规则回退，生成和优化消息模板。

Result: 实验表明，CRMAgent在受众匹配和营销效果上显著优于商家原始模板。

Conclusion: CRMAgent为商家提供了一种可扩展且高效的CRM消息生成解决方案。

Abstract: In e-commerce private-domain channels such as instant messaging and e-mail,
merchants engage customers directly as part of their Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) programmes to drive retention and conversion. While a few top
performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to
write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We
introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs)
that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance
through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the
agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same
audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second,
retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment
and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their
successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a
rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable
references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently
outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both
audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

fragments from weaker outputs; GPT-4.1 then uses this prompt to create one idea
per patent, and an Elo loop judged by Qwen3-8B selects the best prompt-all
without extra training data. Across three domains, two evaluator types, and six
criteria, MK2 topped the automatic leaderboard and won 25 of 36 tests. Only the
materials-chemistry track lagged, indicating the need for deeper domain
grounding; yet, the results show that lightweight prompt engineering has
already delivered competitive, commercially relevant ideation from patents.

Result: 知识蒸馏在有大模型教师时表现优于对比学习，但在教师模型容量相同时优势不明显，尤其是跨域任务。

Conclusion: 建议在有大模型教师时使用知识蒸馏训练小型重排器，否则选择对比学习。

Abstract: Training text rerankers is crucial for information retrieval. Two primary
strategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on
ground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a
larger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear
comparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under
practical conditions is needed.
  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of
different sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a
strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our
results show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and
out-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling
from a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model
sizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same
capacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain
tasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy
based on available teacher models. Therefore, we recommend using knowledge
distillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is
accessible; in its absence, contrastive learning provides a strong and more
reliable alternative otherwise.

Motivation: 系统探索金融领域中提升LLMs和RLLMs性能的方法，填补研究空白。

Method: 使用五种LLMs和三种RLLMs，评估提示方法、代理框架和多语言对齐方法对金融问答任务的影响。

Result: 1. 提示方法和代理框架通过模拟长链推理提升LLMs性能；2. RLLMs固有长链推理能力限制了传统方法的优化空间；3. 多语言对齐方法通过延长推理长度提升LLMs的多语言表现，但对RLLMs效果有限。

Conclusion: 本研究为金融问答领域的LLMs和RLLMs提供了重要参考，揭示了当前方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large
language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many
researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance
of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that
systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs
and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various
methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the
effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment
methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate:
(1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of
LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess
inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional
methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced
multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance
of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for
RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and
RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.

TL;DR: 评估生成任务的自动n-gram指标（如ROUGE）在英语中表现良好，但在其他语言中的适用性尚不明确。本文通过大规模多语言实验发现，指标表现与语言类型相关，神经指标（如COMET）在低资源语言中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨n-gram和神经指标在多语言生成任务中的有效性，尤其是与人类评估的相关性。

Method: 设计跨八种语言（四种类型学家族）的大规模评估套件，分析指标与人类判断的相关性。

Result: n-gram指标在融合语言中表现较差，神经指标（如COMET）在低资源语言中表现更优。

Conclusion: n-gram指标在融合语言中存在局限性，应更多投资于神经指标的训练。

Abstract: Automatic n-gram based metrics such as ROUGE are widely used for evaluating
generative tasks such as summarization. While these metrics are considered
indicative (even if imperfect) of human evaluation for English, their
suitability for other languages remains unclear. To address this, we
systematically assess evaluation metrics for generation both n-gram-based and
neural based to evaluate their effectiveness across languages and tasks.
Specifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages
from four typological families: agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and
high-fusional, spanning both low- and high-resource settings, to analyze their
correlation with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of
evaluation metrics to the language type. For example, in fusional languages,
n-gram-based metrics show lower correlation with human assessments compared to
isolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that proper
tokenization can significantly mitigate this issue for morphologically rich
fusional languages, sometimes even reversing negative trends. Additionally, we
show that neural-based metrics specifically trained for evaluation, such as
COMET, consistently outperform other neural metrics and better correlate with
human judgments in low-resource languages. Overall, our analysis highlights the
limitations of n-gram metrics for fusional languages and advocates for greater
investment in neural-based metrics trained for evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support creative tasks
such as research idea generation. While recent work has shown that structured
dialogues between LLMs can improve the novelty and feasibility of generated
ideas, the optimal design of such interactions remains unclear. In this study,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multi-agent LLM dialogues for scientific
ideation. We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents,
and dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and
feasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where
one agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative
improvement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the
interaction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the
diversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side
diversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the
feasibility of the final proposals. Our findings offer practical guidelines for
building effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation. Our code is

Motivation: 探讨如何通过微调数据的选择减少语言模型的幻觉问题，尤其是长文本生成中的事实错误。

Method: 研究微调数据的真实性对幻觉的影响，比较使用人工标注数据与模型生成数据的差异，并评估过滤策略的效果。

Result: 微调模型自身认为可信的生成数据，比使用人工标注数据更能提升事实准确性，且这一效果在不同领域均适用。

Conclusion: 模型自身的判断可以作为提升事实准确性的有效信号，为减少幻觉提供新思路。

Abstract: Language models are prone to hallucination - generating text that is
factually incorrect. Finetuning models on high-quality factual information can
potentially reduce hallucination, but concerns remain; obtaining factual gold
data can be expensive and training on correct but unfamiliar data may
potentially lead to even more downstream hallucination. What data should
practitioners finetune on to mitigate hallucinations in language models? In
this work, we study the relationship between the factuality of finetuning data
and the prevalence of hallucinations in long-form generation tasks.
Counterintuitively, we find that finetuning on factual gold data is not as
helpful as finetuning on model-generated data that models believe to be
factual. Next, we evaluate filtering strategies applied on both factual gold
data and model-generated data, and find that finetuning on model-generated data
that is filtered by models' own internal judgments often leads to better
overall factuality compared to other configurations: training on gold data
filtered by models' judgments, training on gold data alone, or training on
model-generated data that is supported by gold data. These factuality
improvements transfer across three domains we study, suggesting that a models'
own beliefs can provide a powerful signal for factuality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their transformative potential
across numerous disciplinary studies, reshaping the existing research
methodologies and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. However, a
systematic understanding of their integration into diverse disciplines remains
underexplored. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the

a technical standpoint, key methodologies such as supervised fine-tuning,
retrieval-augmented generation, agent-based approaches, and tool-use
integration are examined, which enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of
LLMs in discipline-specific contexts. From the perspective of their
applicability, this paper explores how LLMs are contributing to various
disciplines including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and the
humanities and social sciences, demonstrating their role in discipline-specific
tasks. The prevailing challenges are critically examined and the promising
research directions are highlighted alongside the recent advances in LLMs. By
providing a comprehensive overview of the technical developments and
applications in this field, this survey aims to serve as an invaluable resource

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM知识编辑方法在关联事实传播中难以保持逻辑一致性。

Conclusion: ChainEdit在知识编辑中实现了逻辑一致性的新突破，并优化了评估标准。

Abstract: Current knowledge editing methods for large language models (LLMs) struggle
to maintain logical consistency when propagating ripple effects to associated
facts. We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge
graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable
systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from
structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics,
ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge
clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical
generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and
specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks
through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This
work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while
ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.

Abstract: Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring
together experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a
consensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences
often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and
collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through
collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,
we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision
conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant
agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance
detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and
stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,
negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent
system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results
indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced
debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also
improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and
coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision
conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate
the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group
decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be
instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops
across various domains.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various
tasks, the mainstream LLM platforms generate massive user-model interactions
daily. In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose
failures in their answers, it is essential to develop an automated framework to
systematically categorize and attribute errors. However, existing evaluation
models lack error attribution capability. In this work, we establish a
comprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary
categories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present
AttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing
misattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also
propose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first
general-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score,
misattribution, and feedback. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted
to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

Result: LLM能有效支持税务任务并提供法律依据，但当前原型无法完全自动化。

Conclusion: LLM在税务领域有潜力，但需进一步整合结构化背景信息以处理隐性知识和特定文档。

Abstract: This paper provides an experimental evaluation of the capability of large
language models (LLMs) to assist in legal decision-making within the framework
of Austrian and European Union value-added tax (VAT) law. In tax consulting
practice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime
candidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of
tax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and
well-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a
considerable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for
enhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and
real-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the
best configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to
support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial
analyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to
the sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when
properly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and
provide legally grounded justifications for decisions. However, limitations
remain regarding the handling of implicit client knowledge and context-specific
documentation, underscoring the need for future integration of structured
background information.

Conclusion: 该研究为教育类文章的自动连贯性评分提供了一种潜在改进方法。

Abstract: Essays are considered a valuable mechanism for evaluating learning outcomes
in writing. Textual cohesion is an essential characteristic of a text, as it
facilitates the establishment of meaning between its parts. Automatically
scoring cohesion in essays presents a challenge in the field of educational
artificial intelligence. The machine learning algorithms used to evaluate texts
generally do not consider the individual characteristics of the instances that
comprise the analysed corpus. In this meaning, item response theory can be
adapted to the context of machine learning, characterising the ability,
difficulty and discrimination of the models used. This work proposes and
analyses the performance of a cohesion score prediction approach based on item
response theory to adjust the scores generated by machine learning models. In
this study, the corpus selected for the experiments consisted of the extended
Essay-BR, which includes 6,563 essays in the style of the National High School
Exam (ENEM), and the Brazilian Portuguese Narrative Essays, comprising 1,235
essays written by 5th to 9th grade students from public schools. We extracted
325 linguistic features and treated the problem as a machine learning
regression task. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach
outperforms conventional machine learning models and ensemble methods in
several evaluation metrics. This research explores a potential approach for
improving the automatic evaluation of cohesion in educational essays.

Abstract: There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating large language models
(LLMs), reference-based evaluation and preference-based evaluation. The first,
carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies
on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are
available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often
self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to
several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their
most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is
tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual
use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged
that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over
multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing
goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this
approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by
the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we
present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has
in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how
it can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark
game instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be
extended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have advanced procedural planning for
embodied AI systems through strong reasoning abilities, the integration of
multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning remains underexplored. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework
designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action
sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using
vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary
modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment
Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive
feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and
emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the
Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential
counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in
counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED
benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior
LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models. The code and models are

Conclusion: LLM在LDA后校正阶段表现优异，但初始化效果有限，挑战了LLMs总是优于传统文本挖掘方法的观点。

Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a prominent generative probabilistic
model used for uncovering abstract topics within document collections. In this
paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting topic models with Large
Language Models (LLMs) through integration into two key phases: Initialization
and Post-Correction. Since the LDA is highly dependent on the quality of its
initialization, we conduct extensive experiments on the LLM-guided topic
clustering for initializing the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Interestingly, the
experimental results reveal that while the proposed initialization strategy
improves the early iterations of LDA, it has no effect on the convergence and
yields the worst performance compared to the baselines. The LLM-enabled
post-correction, on the other hand, achieved a promising improvement of 5.86%
in the coherence evaluation. These results highlight the practical benefits of
the LLM-in-the-loop approach and challenge the belief that LLMs are always the
superior text mining alternative.

Conclusion: 该框架为多语言情感检测提供了可扩展的解决方案，平衡了模型复杂性和计算成本。

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in
Text-Based Emotion Detection (Track A), which focuses on multi-label emotion
detection in short texts. We propose a feature-centric framework that
dynamically adapts document representations and learning algorithms to optimize
language-specific performance. Our study evaluates three key components:
document representation, dimensionality reduction, and model training in 28
languages, highlighting five for detailed analysis. The results show that
TF-IDF remains highly effective for low-resource languages, while contextual
embeddings like FastText and transformer-based document representations, such
as those produced by Sentence-BERT, exhibit language-specific strengths.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces training time without compromising
performance, particularly benefiting FastText and neural models such as
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Computational efficiency analysis underscores
the trade-off between model complexity and processing cost. Our framework
provides a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, addressing the
challenges of linguistic diversity and resource constraints.

TL;DR: DocPolarBERT是一种布局感知的BERT模型，通过相对极坐标系统改进自注意力机制，无需绝对2D位置嵌入，在小规模预训练数据上实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文档理解模型依赖绝对2D位置嵌入，计算成本高且数据需求大。DocPolarBERT旨在通过相对极坐标系统简化模型设计并减少数据依赖。

Method: 扩展自注意力机制，采用相对极坐标系表示文本块位置，替代传统的笛卡尔坐标系。

Result: 在预训练数据量仅为IIT-CDIP六分之一的情况下，DocPolarBERT仍达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 精心设计的注意力机制可弥补数据量不足，为文档理解提供高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce DocPolarBERT, a layout-aware BERT model for document
understanding that eliminates the need for absolute 2D positional embeddings.
We extend self-attention to take into account text block positions in relative
polar coordinate system rather than the Cartesian one. Despite being
pre-trained on a dataset more than six times smaller than the widely used
IIT-CDIP corpus, DocPolarBERT achieves state-of-the-art results. These results
demonstrate that a carefully designed attention mechanism can compensate for
reduced pre-training data, offering an efficient and effective alternative for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补LLMs在公开论证分类数据库中的研究空白，验证其性能并分析常见错误。

Method: 使用Args.me和UKP等多样化数据集，测试GPT、Llama、DeepSeek等模型及其推理增强变体。

Result: ChatGPT-4o在论证分类基准中表现最优，Deepseek-R1在推理增强模型中表现最佳，但两者仍有错误。

Conclusion: 研究首次全面分析了LLMs在论证数据集中的表现，揭示了已知提示算法的弱点并提出了改进方向。

Abstract: Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates
insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and
computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of
argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of
relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently,
the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large
language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and
extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep
learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the
quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the
operation of these models in publicly available argument classification
databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse
datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT,
Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the
Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms
the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models
incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its
superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still
make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our
knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned
datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses
of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions
for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of
the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了自动语音识别（ASR）转录错误对说话人归属任务的影响，发现ASR转录的错误对任务性能影响较小，甚至可能优于人工转录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 说话人归属任务在音频不可用或不可靠时尤为重要，但此前研究多基于人工转录，而现实中多使用ASR转录。

Method: 首次全面研究ASR转录错误对说话人归属性能的影响，分析转录错误程度及ASR系统特性对任务的影响。

Result: 说话人归属对单词级转录错误具有较强鲁棒性，且恢复真实转录的目标与归属性能相关性极低。

Conclusion: ASR转录的错误可能捕捉到说话人特有特征，因此其说话人归属性能不逊于甚至优于人工转录。

Abstract: Speaker attribution from speech transcripts is the task of identifying a
speaker from the transcript of their speech based on patterns in their language
use. This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.
deleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has
primarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts
produced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only
has more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first
comprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker
attribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker
attribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well
as how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that
attribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and
that the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated
with attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker
attribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not
better, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR
transcription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker
identity.

TL;DR: KELPS框架通过神经符号方法将非正式数学转化为多种形式语言，解决了多语言平行语料库的瓶颈问题，并在多个数据集上表现优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在形式化非正式数学时因多语言平行语料库数量和质量不足而面临的瓶颈问题。

Method: 提出KELPS框架，通过知识方程（KEs）将自然语言转化为多种形式语言（Lean、Coq、Isabelle），并定义严格规则确保结构和语义一致性。

Result: 生成了60,000个问题的平行语料库，在MiniF2F上达到88.9%的语法准确率，优于Deepseek-V3（81%）和Herald（81.3%）。

Conclusion: KELPS框架在形式化数学任务中表现出色，为多语言形式化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) show promising progress in formalizing
informal mathematics into machine-verifiable theorems. However, these methods
still face bottlenecks due to the limited quantity and quality of multilingual
parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework
KELPS (Knowledge-Equation based Logical Processing System) to address these
problems. KELPS is an iterative framework for translating, synthesizing, and
filtering informal data into multiple formal languages (Lean, Coq, and
Isabelle). First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs),
a novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic.
Next, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that
preserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning. This process yielded a
parallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic
accuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3
(81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets. All datasets and codes are
available in the supplementary materials.

*Songlin Zhai,Guilin Qi,Yuan Meng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需参数更新的动态知识图谱增强框架（KGA），通过内外聚合路径实现实时知识融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有知识图谱增强方法依赖参数微调导致的灾难性遗忘和静态框架适应性问题。

Method: 设计了知识图谱引导注意力模块（KGA），包含向外和向内两条聚合路径，动态融合外部知识并过滤无关信号。

Result: 在五个基准测试中验证了KGA的知识融合性能。

Conclusion: KGA框架在无需参数更新的情况下实现了实时知识融合，性能优异。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language
models (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the
learning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on
parameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and
degrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited
adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration
frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time
KG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge
graph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion
without any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard
self-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward
aggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external
knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward
aggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations
through KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying
knowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles
knowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds
them back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.
By synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports
real-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter
modification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable
knowledge fusion performance of KGA.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型（LLMs）多为纯文本模型，忽略了软件开发中常用的视觉辅助工具（如图表和流程图），导致代码生成与实际需求存在差距。

Method: 开发了MM-Coder，结合视觉工作流（Visual Workflow）和文本指令，并构建了MMc-Instruct数据集和MMEval基准。

Result: 评估显示，模型在视觉信息捕捉、指令遵循和高级编程知识方面仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: MM-Coder旨在通过多模态输入革新工业编程，使LLMs能够理解和实现通过文本和视觉设计传达的复杂规范。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
improved code generation, yet most models remain text-only, neglecting crucial
visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts used in real-world software
development. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual
Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified
Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with
textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural
alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal
instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation,
allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human
developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce
MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing
existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight
significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information
capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work
aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and
implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级方法“cache steering”，通过一次性干预键值缓存来隐式引导语言模型，无需微调或修改提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过简单干预提升小型语言模型的推理能力，尤其是多步推理，同时避免传统激活引导技术的高成本和复杂性。

Method: 利用GPT-4生成的推理轨迹构建引导向量，直接干预键值缓存，诱导模型进行链式推理。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在推理任务中提升了模型的推理结构和定量性能，且具有超参数稳定性和高效性。

Conclusion: cache steering是一种更稳健、实用的控制生成方法，优于传统连续干预技术。

Abstract: We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of
language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value
cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce
chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages
GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift
model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning
or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative
structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to
prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our
one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of
hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,
making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: FlowDrag通过结合几何信息改进拖拽编辑，解决了现有方法因仅关注用户定义点而导致的几何不一致问题，并通过VFD基准数据集提供真实帧以评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有拖拽编辑方法因忽略整体几何信息导致编辑不稳定或产生伪影，需更精确的解决方案。

Method: FlowDrag构建3D网格，利用能量函数指导变形，并通过UNet去噪过程实现精确点对齐。

Result: FlowDrag在VFD Bench和DragBench上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlowDrag通过几何信息整合和VFD基准，显著提升了拖拽编辑的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Drag-based editing allows precise object manipulation through point-based
control, offering user convenience. However, current methods often suffer from
a geometric inconsistency problem by focusing exclusively on matching
user-defined points, neglecting the broader geometry and leading to artifacts
or unstable edits. We propose FlowDrag, which leverages geometric information
for more accurate and coherent transformations. Our approach constructs a 3D
mesh from the image, using an energy function to guide mesh deformation based
on user-defined drag points. The resulting mesh displacements are projected
into 2D and incorporated into a UNet denoising process, enabling precise
handle-to-target point alignment while preserving structural integrity.
Additionally, existing drag-editing benchmarks provide no ground truth, making
it difficult to assess how accurately the edits match the intended
transformations. To address this, we present VFD (VidFrameDrag) benchmark
dataset, which provides ground-truth frames using consecutive shots in a video
dataset. FlowDrag outperforms existing drag-based editing methods on both VFD
Bench and DragBench.

TL;DR: 提出了一种合成生成管道，用于创建大规模3D视觉指令数据集，以解决多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在相机-物体关系识别上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在相机-物体关系（如物体方向、相机视角和镜头）识别上表现不佳，主要因为训练数据缺乏多样性。

Method: 利用3D资产、渲染和扩散模型生成逼真图像，结合LLMs生成文本提示，创建了Ultimate3D数据集（240K VQAs）。

Result: 在相机-物体关系识别任务上，MLLMs的准确率平均提升了33.4%，显著优于商业模型。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和框架为MLLMs的广泛应用提供了支持。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with accurately capturing
camera-object relations, especially for object orientation, camera viewpoint,
and camera shots. This stems from the fact that existing MLLMs are trained on
images with limited diverse camera-object relations and corresponding textual
descriptions. To address this, we propose a synthetic generation pipeline to
create large-scale 3D visual instruction datasets. Our framework takes 3D
assets as input and uses rendering and diffusion-based image generation models
to create photorealistic images preserving precise camera-object relations.
Additionally, large language models (LLMs) are used to generate text prompts
for guiding visual instruction tuning and controlling image generation. We
create Ultimate3D, a dataset of 240K VQAs with precise camera-object
annotations, and corresponding benchmark. MLLMs fine-tuned on our proposed
dataset outperform commercial models by a large margin, achieving an average
accuracy improvement of 33.4% on camera-object relation recognition tasks. Our
code, dataset, and benchmark will contribute to broad MLLM applications.

Motivation: 在拥挤环境中，理解并控制交通流对机器人群体协调和基础设施设计至关重要。

Method: 结合模拟、理论和机器人实验，分析噪声水平对交通流的影响，并比较简单反应性导航与中央规划器的性能。

Result: 高于临界噪声水平时，大型拥堵不会持续；简单反应性导航在中等密度下表现高效。

Conclusion: 简单反应性导航在现实问题中更具计算效率，适用于中等密度场景。

Abstract: In crowded environments, individuals must navigate around other occupants to
reach their destinations. Understanding and controlling traffic flows in these
spaces is relevant to coordinating robot swarms and designing infrastructure
for dense populations. Here, we combine simulations, theory, and robotic
experiments to study how noisy motion can disrupt traffic jams and enable flow
as agents travel to individual goals. Above a critical noise level, large jams
do not persist. From this observation, we analytically approximate the goal
attainment rate as a function of the noise level, then solve for the optimal
agent density and noise level that maximize the swarm's goal attainment rate.
We perform robotic experiments to corroborate our simulated and theoretical
results. Finally, we compare simple, local navigation approaches with a
sophisticated but computationally costly central planner. A simple reactive
scheme performs well up to moderate densities and is far more computationally
efficient than a planner, suggesting lessons for real-world problems.

Result: 通过多种评估指标（如均方误差、方差分数和前馈时间）比较了两种网络的性能，明确了哪种更适合实际应用。

Conclusion: 研究成功验证了两种CNN在避障导航中的有效性，并提供了选择最佳网络的依据。

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance is crucial for mobile robots' navigation in both known and
unknown environments. This research designs, trains, and tests two custom
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), using color and depth images from a depth
camera as inputs. Both networks adopt sensor fusion to produce an output: the
mobile robot's angular velocity, which serves as the robot's steering command.
A newly obtained visual dataset for navigation was collected in diverse
environments with varying lighting conditions and dynamic obstacles. During
data collection, a communication link was established over Wi-Fi between a
remote server and the robot, using Robot Operating System (ROS) topics.
Velocity commands were transmitted from the server to the robot, enabling
synchronized recording of visual data and the corresponding steering commands.
Various evaluation metrics, such as Mean Squared Error, Variance Score, and
Feed-Forward time, provided a clear comparison between the two networks and
clarified which one to use for the application.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在机器人程序规划中忽略低层次细节的问题，以及当前视觉语言模型依赖昂贵大规模模型或局限于狭窄模拟环境的限制。

Method: 采用自我改进框架SelfReVision，结合链式思维提示和自我指导范式，使小规模VLMs能够迭代批判、修订和验证自身计划。

Result: SelfReVision显著提升了小规模VLMs的性能，甚至优于规模大100倍的模型，并在下游具体任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: SelfReVision为视觉语言程序规划提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，无需外部监督即可生成高质量、可执行的计划。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in robotic procedural
planning, yet their human-centric reasoning often omits the low-level, grounded
details needed for robotic execution. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a
path toward more perceptually grounded plans, but current methods either rely
on expensive, large-scale models or are constrained to narrow simulation
settings. We introduce SelfReVision, a lightweight and scalable
self-improvement framework for vision-language procedural planning.
SelfReVision enables small VLMs to iteratively critique, revise, and verify
their own plans-without external supervision or teacher models-drawing
inspiration from chain-of-thought prompting and self-instruct paradigms.
Through this self-distillation loop, models generate higher-quality,
execution-ready plans that can be used both at inference and for continued
fine-tuning. Using models varying from 3B to 72B, our results show that
SelfReVision not only boosts performance over weak base VLMs but also
outperforms models 100X the size, yielding improved control in downstream
embodied tasks.

Conclusion: CL3R通过整合3D与2D信息，显著提升了机器人操作的感知能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: Building a robust perception module is crucial for visuomotor policy
learning. While recent methods incorporate pre-trained 2D foundation models
into robotic perception modules to leverage their strong semantic
understanding, they struggle to capture 3D spatial information and generalize
across diverse camera viewpoints. These limitations hinder the policy's
effectiveness, especially in fine-grained robotic manipulation scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose CL3R, a novel 3D pre-training framework
designed to enhance robotic manipulation policies. Our method integrates both
spatial awareness and semantic understanding by employing a point cloud Masked
Autoencoder to learn rich 3D representations while leveraging pre-trained 2D
foundation models through contrastive learning for efficient semantic knowledge
transfer. Additionally, we propose a 3D visual representation pre-training
framework for robotic tasks. By unifying coordinate systems across datasets and
introducing random fusion of multi-view point clouds, we mitigate camera view
ambiguity and improve generalization, enabling robust perception from novel
viewpoints at test time. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real
world demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting its effectiveness
in visuomotor policy learning for robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Humanoid robots show significant potential in daily tasks. However,
reinforcement learning-based motion policies often suffer from robustness
degradation due to the sim-to-real dynamics gap, thereby affecting the agility
of real robots. In this work, we propose a novel robust adversarial training
paradigm designed to enhance the robustness of humanoid motion policies in real
worlds. The paradigm introduces a learnable adversarial attack network that
precisely identifies vulnerabilities in motion policies and applies targeted
perturbations, forcing the motion policy to enhance its robustness against
perturbations through dynamic adversarial training. We conduct experiments on
the Unitree G1 humanoid robot for both perceptive locomotion and whole-body
control tasks. The results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly
enhances the robot's motion robustness in real world environments, enabling
successful traversal of challenging terrains and highly agile whole-body
trajectory tracking.

Abstract: Accurate extrinsic calibration between multiple LiDAR sensors and a
GNSS-aided inertial navigation system (GINS) is essential for achieving
reliable sensor fusion in intelligent mining environments. Such calibration
enables vehicle-road collaboration by aligning perception data from
vehicle-mounted sensors to a unified global reference frame. However, existing
methods often depend on artificial targets, overlapping fields of view, or
precise trajectory estimation, which are assumptions that may not hold in
practice. Moreover, the planar motion of mining vehicles leads to observability
issues that degrade calibration performance. This paper presents a targetless
extrinsic calibration method that aligns multiple onboard LiDAR sensors to the
GINS coordinate system without requiring overlapping sensor views or external
targets. The proposed approach introduces an observation model based on the
known installation height of the GINS unit to constrain unobservable
calibration parameters under planar motion. A joint optimization framework is
developed to refine both the extrinsic parameters and GINS trajectory by
integrating multiple constraints derived from geometric correspondences and
motion consistency. The proposed method is applicable to heterogeneous LiDAR
configurations, including both mechanical and solid-state sensors. Extensive
experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the accuracy,
robustness, and practical applicability of the approach under diverse sensor
setups.

TL;DR: 论文提出了M3DGR数据集和Ground-Fusion++框架，解决了SLAM在复杂环境中的鲁棒性评估和自适应多传感器融合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SLAM方法在结构化环境中表现良好，但在极端情况下鲁棒性不足，且缺乏标准化评估和多传感器自适应融合策略。

Method: 1. 提出M3DGR数据集，包含多种传感器退化场景；2. 评估40种SLAM系统；3. 开发Ground-Fusion++框架，融合多种传感器。

Result: M3DGR数据集提供了全面评估，Ground-Fusion++在复杂条件下表现出色。

Conclusion: 论文填补了SLAM评估和自适应融合的空白，公开了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Considerable advancements have been achieved in SLAM methods tailored for
structured environments, yet their robustness under challenging corner cases
remains a critical limitation. Although multi-sensor fusion approaches
integrating diverse sensors have shown promising performance improvements, the
research community faces two key barriers: On one hand, the lack of
standardized and configurable benchmarks that systematically evaluate SLAM
algorithms under diverse degradation scenarios hinders comprehensive
performance assessment. While on the other hand, existing SLAM frameworks
primarily focus on fusing a limited set of sensor types, without effectively
addressing adaptive sensor selection strategies for varying environmental
conditions.
  To bridge these gaps, we make three key contributions: First, we introduce
M3DGR dataset: a sensor-rich benchmark with systematically induced degradation
patterns including visual challenge, LiDAR degeneracy, wheel slippage and GNSS
denial. Second, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of forty SLAM systems on
M3DGR, providing critical insights into their robustness and limitations under
challenging real-world conditions. Third, we develop a resilient modular
multi-sensor fusion framework named Ground-Fusion++, which demonstrates robust
performance by coupling GNSS, RGB-D, LiDAR, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and
wheel odometry. Codes and datasets are publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的卫星姿态控制策略TD3-HD，结合了Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient（TD3）、Hindsight Experience Replay（HER）和Dimension Wise Clipping（DWC），以提升卫星在故障条件下的适应性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星在动态和不确定环境中自主运行时，传统控制方法和现有DRL算法（如TD3、PPO、A2C）在实时适应性和容错性方面表现不足，需要更可靠的解决方案。

Method: 提出TD3-HD方法，结合TD3、HER和DWC，优化稀疏奖励环境下的学习效果，并在反应轮（RW）故障时保持卫星稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，TD3-HD在姿态误差、角速度调节和故障条件下的稳定性方面显著优于传统PD控制和现有DRL算法。

Conclusion: TD3-HD是一种强大且容错的AI解决方案，适用于自主卫星姿态控制。

Abstract: Reliable satellite attitude control is essential for the success of space
missions, particularly as satellites increasingly operate autonomously in
dynamic and uncertain environments. Reaction wheels (RWs) play a pivotal role
in attitude control, and maintaining control resilience during RW faults is
critical to preserving mission objectives and system stability. However,
traditional Proportional Derivative (PD) controllers and existing deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms such as TD3, PPO, and A2C often fall
short in providing the real time adaptability and fault tolerance required for
autonomous satellite operations. This study introduces a DRL-based control
strategy designed to improve satellite resilience and adaptability under fault
conditions. Specifically, the proposed method integrates Twin Delayed Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and
Dimension Wise Clipping (DWC) referred to as TD3-HD to enhance learning in
sparse reward environments and maintain satellite stability during RW failures.
The proposed approach is benchmarked against PD control and leading DRL
algorithms. Experimental results show that TD3-HD achieves significantly lower
attitude error, improved angular velocity regulation, and enhanced stability
under fault conditions. These findings underscore the proposed method potential
as a powerful, fault tolerant, onboard AI solution for autonomous satellite
attitude control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR 3D映射在GNSS受限环境中存在累积漂移导致的全局错位问题，需要一种综合解决方案。

Method: 采用动态时间规整进行速度对齐，扩展卡尔曼滤波优化GNSS和IMU信号，局部地图通过NDT配准和位姿图优化构建，全局一致性通过GNSS约束锚点和重叠段精细配准实现。

Result: 全局对齐误差从3.32米降至1.24米，提升61.4%，构建的高保真地图支持多种应用。

Conclusion: 该方法与数据集为GNSS受限环境中的3D城市映射建立了新基准，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D mapping suffers from cumulative drift causing global
misalignment, particularly in GNSS-constrained environments. To address this,
we propose a unified framework that fuses LiDAR, GNSS, and IMU data for
high-resolution city-scale mapping. The method performs velocity-based temporal
alignment using Dynamic Time Warping and refines GNSS and IMU signals via
extended Kalman filtering. Local maps are built using Normal Distributions
Transform-based registration and pose graph optimization with loop closure
detection, while global consistency is enforced using GNSS-constrained anchors
followed by fine registration of overlapping segments. We also introduce a
large-scale multimodal dataset captured in Perth, Western Australia to
facilitate future research in this direction. Our dataset comprises 144{,}000
frames acquired with a 128-channel Ouster LiDAR, synchronized RTK-GNSS
trajectories, and MEMS-IMU measurements across 21 urban loops. To assess
geometric consistency, we evaluated our method using alignment metrics based on
road centerlines and intersections to capture both global and local accuracy.
Our method reduces the average global alignment error from 3.32\,m to 1.24\,m,
achieving a 61.4\% improvement. The constructed high-fidelity map supports a
wide range of applications, including smart city planning, geospatial data
integration, infrastructure monitoring, and GPS-free navigation. Our method,
and dataset together establish a new benchmark for evaluating 3D city mapping
in GNSS-constrained environments. The dataset and code will be released
publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在仿真到现实的机械臂控制中，末端执行器（EE）位置在仿真和现实中存在差异，而现实中通常只能获取关节位置信息。

Method: 使用触摸屏记录机器人接触特定点的信息，基于线性变换和神经网络构建转换函数，填补仿真/现实关节/EE位置的缺失变量。

Result: 完全非线性神经网络模型表现最佳，显著减少了定位误差。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了仿真与现实中EE位置不一致的问题，提升了机械臂控制的准确性。

Abstract: When inverse kinematics (IK) is adopted to control robotic arms in
manipulation tasks, there is often a discrepancy between the end effector (EE)
position of the robot model in the simulator and the physical EE in reality. In
most robotic scenarios with sim-to-real transfer, we have information about
joint positions in both simulation and reality, but the EE position is only
available in simulation. We developed a novel method to overcome this
difficulty based on haptic feedback calibration, using a touchscreen in front
of the robot that provides information on the EE position in the real
environment. During the calibration procedure, the robot touches specific
points on the screen, and the information is stored. In the next stage, we
build a transformation function from the data based on linear transformation
and neural networks that is capable of outputting all missing variables from
any partial input (simulated/real joint/EE position). Our results demonstrate
that a fully nonlinear neural network model performs best, significantly
reducing positioning errors.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的框架，用于动态、速度感知的全身末端执行器控制，解决了运动与手臂动作之间的目标冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运动与手臂动作的目标冲突（如高效运动需要水平基座，而末端执行器跟踪可能需要基座倾斜）以及现有RL方法无法直接控制末端执行器速度的问题。

Method: 采用多批评者-行动者架构，解耦运动与操作的奖励信号，并设计基于扭曲的末端执行器任务公式。

Result: 通过仿真和硬件实验验证，控制器能同时行走和移动末端执行器，并展现出全身协作行为。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了运动与操作的目标冲突，实现了动态、速度感知的全身控制。

Abstract: Learning whole-body control for locomotion and arm motions in a single policy
has challenges, as the two tasks have conflicting goals. For instance,
efficient locomotion typically favors a horizontal base orientation, while
end-effector tracking may benefit from base tilting to extend reachability.
Additionally, current Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches using a pose-based
task specification lack the ability to directly control the end-effector
velocity, making smoothly executing trajectories very challenging. To address
these limitations, we propose an RL-based framework that allows for dynamic,
velocity-aware whole-body end-effector control. Our method introduces a
multi-critic actor architecture that decouples the reward signals for
locomotion and manipulation, simplifying reward tuning and allowing the policy
to resolve task conflicts more effectively. Furthermore, we design a
twist-based end-effector task formulation that can track both discrete poses
and motion trajectories. We validate our approach through a set of simulation
and hardware experiments using a quadruped robot equipped with a robotic arm.
The resulting controller can simultaneously walk and move its end-effector and
shows emergent whole-body behaviors, where the base assists the arm in
extending the workspace, despite a lack of explicit formulations.

Motivation: 解决从真实图像数据学习机器人操作策略时的高成本问题，以及仿真与真实环境间的视觉域差距。

Method: 利用稀疏视角高斯泼溅重建人类-机器人交接场景，生成机器人演示数据，并直接训练策略。

Result: 在重建场景和真实实验中均验证了H2RH-SGS的有效性。

Conclusion: H2RH-SGS为人类-机器人交接任务提供了一种新的高效表示方法。

Abstract: Learning robot manipulation policies from raw, real-world image data requires
a large number of robot-action trials in the physical environment. Although
training using simulations offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual
domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation.
Gaussian Splatting visual reconstruction methods have recently provided new
directions for robot manipulation by generating realistic environments. In this
paper, we propose the first method for learning supervised-based robot
handovers solely from RGB images without the need of real-robot training or
real-robot data collection. The proposed policy learner, Human-to-Robot
Handover using Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting (H2RH-SGS), leverages sparse-view
Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate
robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera
mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in
the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes.
We train a robot policy on demonstrations collected with 16 household objects
and {\em directly} deploy this policy in the real environment. Experiments in
both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot
handover experiments demonstrate that H2RH-SGS serves as a new and effective
representation for the human-to-robot handover task.

Abstract: The paper presents our system developed for table question answering (TQA).
TQA tasks face challenges due to the characteristics of real-world tabular

Result: 提供了一种分析对抗动态的原则性方法，并降低了越狱风险。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM安全防御提供了理论基础和实践工具。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, the challenge of jailbreaking, where adversaries manipulate the
models to bypass safety mechanisms, has become a significant concern. This
paper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions
between attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The
framework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form
game, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while
anticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI
solution, the "Purple Agent," which integrates adversarial exploration and
defensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple
Agent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes
proactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled
method for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for
mitigating the risk of jailbreaking.

Method: 提出LLM-Nash框架，将均衡定义在提示空间，通过LLM推理生成行为输出，分析认知约束和心态表达。

Result: 推理均衡可能与传统纳什均衡不同，为LLM系统的策略交互提供新视角。

Conclusion: LLM-Nash为研究有限理性下的策略交互提供了新工具，扩展了博弈论在LLM领域的应用。

Abstract: We introduce the LLM-Nash framework, a game-theoretic model where agents
select reasoning prompts to guide decision-making via Large Language Models
(LLMs). Unlike classical games that assume utility-maximizing agents with full
rationality, this framework captures bounded rationality by modeling the
reasoning process explicitly. Equilibrium is defined over the prompt space,
with actions emerging as the behavioral output of LLM inference. This approach
enables the study of cognitive constraints, mindset expressiveness, and
epistemic learning. Through illustrative examples, we show how reasoning
equilibria can diverge from classical Nash outcomes, offering a new foundation
for strategic interaction in LLM-enabled systems.

Abstract: What drives an agent to explore the world while also maintaining control over
the environment? From a child at play to scientists in the lab, intelligent
agents must balance curiosity (the drive to seek knowledge) with competence
(the drive to master and control the environment). Bridging cognitive theories
of intrinsic motivation with reinforcement learning, we ask how evolving
internal representations mediate the trade-off between curiosity (novelty or
information gain) and competence (empowerment). We compare two model-based
agents using handcrafted state abstractions (Tabular) or learning an internal
world model (Dreamer). The Tabular agent shows curiosity and competence guide
exploration in distinct patterns, while prioritizing both improves exploration.
The Dreamer agent reveals a two-way interaction between exploration and
representation learning, mirroring the developmental co-evolution of curiosity
and competence. Our findings formalize adaptive exploration as a balance
between pursuing the unknown and the controllable, offering insights for
cognitive theories and efficient reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: 参数化接地方法为神经符号推理提供了灵活性和理论保证，显著提升了可扩展性。

Abstract: A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to
process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order
Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A
fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,
which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a
(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all
possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic
knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground
formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other
methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more
computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees
of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking
inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a
parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward
Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly
employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off
between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental
results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as
important as the NeSy method itself.

Result: 在IID和非IID数据分布下，准确率分别提升6.84%和7.25%。

Conclusion: 多模态量子联邦学习框架有效解决了缺失模态问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) has been recently introduced to enable a
distributed privacy-preserving quantum machine learning (QML) model training
across quantum processors (clients). Despite recent research efforts, existing
QFL frameworks predominantly focus on unimodal systems, limiting their
applicability to real-world tasks that often naturally involve multiple
modalities. To fill this significant gap, we present for the first time a novel
multimodal approach specifically tailored for the QFL setting with the
intermediate fusion using quantum entanglement. Furthermore, to address a major
bottleneck in multimodal QFL, where the absence of certain modalities during
training can degrade model performance, we introduce a Missing Modality
Agnostic (MMA) mechanism that isolates untrained quantum circuits, ensuring
stable training without corrupted states. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed multimodal QFL method with MMA yields an improvement in accuracy
of 6.84% in independent and identically distributed (IID) and 7.25% in non-IID
data distributions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Abductive reasoning, reasoning for inferring explanations for observations,
is often mentioned in scientific, design-related and artistic contexts, but its
understanding varies across these domains. This paper reviews how abductive
reasoning is discussed in epistemology, science and design, and then analyses
how various computational systems use abductive reasoning. Our analysis shows
that neither theoretical accounts nor computational implementations of
abductive reasoning adequately address generating creative hypotheses.
Theoretical frameworks do not provide a straightforward model for generating
creative abductive hypotheses, computational systems largely implement
syllogistic forms of abductive reasoning. We break down abductive computational
systems into components and conclude by identifying specific directions for
future research that could advance the state of creative abductive reasoning in

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一的安全对齐框架，用于处理使用工具的自主LLM代理的安全风险，通过结构化推理和沙盒强化学习抵御用户和工具端的威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主LLM代理的工具使用能力带来了新的安全风险，传统方法无法应对用户和工具端的双重威胁。

Method: 提出三模态分类法（良性、恶意、敏感）和策略驱动决策模型，设计沙盒环境进行细粒度奖励塑造。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，安全对齐的代理显著提升了抗威胁能力，同时保持良性任务的性能。

Conclusion: 安全与有效性可以共同优化，为自主LLM代理的可信部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents capable of tool
usage has introduced new safety risks that go beyond traditional conversational
misuse. These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable
to both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated
threats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we
propose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents,
enabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and
sandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including
benign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and
define a policy-driven decision model. Our framework employs a custom-designed
sandbox environment that simulates real-world tool execution and allows
fine-grained reward shaping. Through extensive evaluations on public and
self-built benchmarks, including Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, and BFCL, we
demonstrate that our safety-aligned agents significantly improve resistance to
security threats while preserving strong utility on benign tasks. Our results
show that safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, laying the
groundwork for trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.

TL;DR: M2-Reasoning-7B模型通过创新的数据管道和动态多任务训练策略，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在动态空间交互中的推理能力，并在8个基准测试中达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在动态空间交互能力上存在不足，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 结合高质量数据生成（294.2K样本）和动态多任务训练策略（包括任务特定奖励），优化模型推理能力。

Result: M2-Reasoning-7B在8个基准测试中表现最优，尤其在通用和空间推理领域。

Conclusion: 该研究通过数据与训练策略的创新，有效提升了模型在复杂推理任务中的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), have
significantly enhanced their reasoning abilities. However, a critical gap
persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability
essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce
M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial
reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data
pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start
fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning
trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic
multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts
between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive
signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows
M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks,
showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.

*Asma Yamani,Malak Baslyman,Moataz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种在多智能体LLM环境中引入伦理倡导代理的框架，用于生成伦理需求草案，并通过案例研究验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在需求获取过程中融入伦理考量至关重要，但传统方法因时间和资源限制难以实现，且常被忽视。

Method: 提出一个框架，通过伦理倡导代理在多智能体LLM环境中对系统描述进行伦理批判和输入，生成伦理需求草案。

Result: 案例研究表明，该框架能捕捉大部分研究人员在30分钟访谈中识别的伦理需求，并引入额外相关需求，但也存在可靠性问题。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于在需求工程中更广泛地融入伦理考量，但需结合人类反馈以确保敏感领域的可靠性。

Abstract: Incorporating ethics into the requirement elicitation process is essential
for creating ethically aligned systems. Although eliciting manual ethics
requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple
stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints.
Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation
process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements
drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting.
This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system
description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from
different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics
requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and
introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also
highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing
the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can
facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering
process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双层次框架，将自然语言映射到逻辑表示，通过高层次任务抽象和低层次逻辑生成两阶段实现，显著提升了推理准确性和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言输入与形式逻辑表示之间的鸿沟，实现更准确、可解释的推理。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，准确率显著提升（最高40%），同时增强了透明度和错误追踪能力。

Conclusion: 双层次框架为LLM提供了一种可信赖、系统化的推理方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Structured reasoning over natural language inputs remains a core challenge in
artificial intelligence, as it requires bridging the gap between unstructured
linguistic expressions and formal logical representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel \textbf{bi-level framework} that maps language to logic through
a two-stage process: high-level task abstraction and low-level logic
generation. At the upper level, a large language model (LLM) parses natural
language queries into intermediate structured representations specifying the
problem type, objectives, decision variables, and symbolic constraints. At the
lower level, the LLM uses these representations to generate symbolic workflows
or executable reasoning programs for accurate and interpretable decision
making. The framework supports modular reasoning, enforces explicit
constraints, and generalizes across domains such as mathematical problem
solving, question answering, and logical inference. We further optimize the
framework with an end-to-end {bi-level} optimization approach that jointly
refines both the high-level abstraction and low-level logic generation stages.
Experiments on multiple realistic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, with
accuracy gains reaching as high as 40\%. Moreover, the bi-level design enhances
transparency and error traceability, offering a promising step toward
trustworthy and systematic reasoning with LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合多粒度稀疏激活和分层知识图谱的框架，用于罕见病诊断，显著提升了性能和信息质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见病诊断因知识表示不足、概念理解有限和临床推理受限而进展缓慢。

Method: 采用多粒度稀疏激活医学概念和分层知识图谱，结合四种匹配算法、多样性控制和五级回退策略。

Result: 在BioASQ罕见病QA集上，BLEU提升0.09，ROUGE提升0.05，准确率提升0.12，峰值准确率达0.89。

Conclusion: 该方法缩短了罕见病患者的诊断周期，提升了信息质量、推理能力和专业表达。

Abstract: Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare,
rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient
knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained
clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity
sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four
complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback
strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph
(taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date
context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09,
ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89
approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms
improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression,
suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease
patients.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用多模态大模型（LMM）自动地理参考生物样本记录的新方法，通过视觉化空间关系，显著提高了地理参考的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然历史收藏中大量未地理参考的生物样本记录问题，传统方法效率低且未充分利用地图信息。

Method: 采用多模态大模型（LMM）和网格化方法，在零样本设置下实现地理参考。

Result: 实验显示该方法平均距离误差约1公里，优于单模态语言模型和现有工具。

Conclusion: 多模态模型能有效理解精细地图，提出将其整合到地理参考工作流程的实用框架。

Abstract: Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries
archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing
complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a
highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the
existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for
georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and
results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent
Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually
contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a
grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a
zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated
dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance
error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and
existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the
experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps.
Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this
method into a georeferencing workflow.

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models~(\textbf{LSLMs}) demonstrate strong
potential in response latency and speech comprehension capabilities, showcasing
general intelligence across speech understanding tasks. However, the ability to
follow speech instructions has not been fully realized due to the lack of
datasets and heavily biased training tasks. Leveraging the rich ASR datasets,
previous approaches have used Large Language Models~(\textbf{LLMs}) to continue
the linguistic information of speech to construct speech instruction datasets.
Yet, due to the gap between LLM-generated results and real human responses, the
continuation methods further amplify these shortcomings. Given the high costs
of collecting and annotating speech instruction datasets by humans, using
speech synthesis to construct large-scale speech instruction datasets has
become a balanced and robust alternative. Although modern
Text-To-Speech~(\textbf{TTS}) models have achieved near-human-level synthesis
quality, it is challenging to appropriately convert out-of-distribution text
instruction to speech due to the limitations of the training data distribution
in TTS models. To address this issue, we propose a query rewriting framework
with multi-LLM knowledge fusion, employing multiple agents to annotate and
validate the synthesized speech, making it possible to construct high-quality
speech instruction datasets without relying on human annotation. Experiments
show that this method can transform text instructions into distributions more
suitable for TTS models for speech synthesis through zero-shot rewriting,
increasing data usability from 72\% to 93\%. It also demonstrates unique
advantages in rewriting tasks that require complex knowledge and
context-related abilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文评估了结构化多代理系统（MAS）在早期工程设计中的表现，发现其在生成设计细节上优于两代理系统（2AS），但在需求覆盖率和代码兼容性上仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期工程设计需要复杂的迭代推理，现有的大语言模型（LLM）工作流难以维持任务连续性并生成可执行模型。

Method: 通过设计状态图（DSG）表示需求、物理实现和物理模型，比较九角色MAS和两代理2AS的性能。

Result: MAS在生成更细粒度的DSG上表现更好，但需求覆盖率低（<20%），代码兼容性平均低于50%。

Conclusion: 结构化多代理系统能增强设计细节，但需求覆盖和代码兼容性仍需改进。

Abstract: Early-stage engineering design involves complex, iterative reasoning, yet
existing large language model (LLM) workflows struggle to maintain task
continuity and generate executable models. We evaluate whether a structured
multi-agent system (MAS) can more effectively manage requirements extraction,
functional decomposition, and simulator code generation than a simpler
two-agent system (2AS). The target application is a solar-powered water
filtration system as described in a cahier des charges. We introduce the
Design-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles
requirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph
nodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS
collapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total
of 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1
70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON
validity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility,
workflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS
maintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage
remained minimal (less than 20\%). Code compatibility peaked at 100\% under
specific 2AS settings but averaged below 50\% for MAS. Only the
reasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by
DeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes)
whereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced
design detail. Reasoning-distilled LLM improved completion rates, yet low
requirements and fidelity gaps in coding persisted.

Motivation: 在Leanabell-Prover-V1的基础上，进一步提升形式化定理证明的性能，通过验证器反馈实现模型的自我修正能力。

Method: 采用强化学习（RL）结合Lean 4验证器的反馈，包括成功指示和错误细节，优化模型的推理轨迹，并引入反馈令牌掩码和简单奖励策略。

Result: 在MiniF2F测试集上，性能分别提升了3.2%（Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B）和2.0%（DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B）。

Conclusion: Leanabell-Prover-V2通过验证器反馈和强化学习显著提升了形式化定理证明的性能，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: We introduce our Leanabell-Prover-V2, a 7B large language models (LLMs) that
can produce formal theorem proofs in Lean 4, with verifier-integrated Long
Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT). Following our previous work Leanabell-Prover-V1, we
continual to choose to posttrain existing strong prover models for further
performance improvement. In our V2 version, we mainly upgrade the Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with feedback provided by the Lean 4 verifier. Crucially,
verifier feedback, such as indicating success or detailing specific errors,
allows the LLM to become ``self-aware'' of the correctness of its own reasoning
process and learn to reflexively correct errors. Leanabell-Prover-V2 directly
optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn verifier interactions,
together with feedback token masking for stable RL training and a simple reward
strategy. Experiments show that Leanabell-Prover-V2 improves performance by
3.2% (pass@128) with Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B and 2.0% (pass@128) with
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B on the MiniF2F test set. The source codes, curated data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理依赖LLMs和MLLMs，但受限于其自然语言理解能力和高推理成本。

Method: 设计了INoT框架，通过LLM-Read代码提示实现程序化对话推理，减少外部迭代成本。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，INoT平均性能提升7.95%，推理成本降低58.3%。

Conclusion: INoT框架有效提升了AI代理的性能并降低了成本，展示了在图像任务中的通用性。

Abstract: AI Agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs) to
perform interpretation and inference in text and image tasks without
post-training, where LLMs and MLLMs play the most critical role and determine
the initial ability and limitations of AI Agents. Usually, AI Agents utilize
sophisticated prompt engineering and external reasoning framework to obtain a
promising interaction with LLMs, e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Iteration of Thought
and Image-of-Thought. However, they are still constrained by the inherent
limitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative
reasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end,
we propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought
(INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute
programmatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt.
Therefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM,
which can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six
benchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified,
with an average improvement of 7.95\% in performance, exceeding the baselines.
Furthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best
performing method at baseline by 58.3\%. In addition, we demonstrate the
versatility of INoT in image interpretation and inference through verification
experiments.
