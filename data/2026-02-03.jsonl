This limitation, analogous to cognitive functional fixedness, prevents agents from restructuring their approach, leading them to pursue unworkable solutions. To address this, we propose PPoGA (Predictive Plan-on-Graph with Action), a novel KGQA framework inspired by human cognitive control and problem-solving. PPoGA incorporates a Planner-Executor architecture to separate high-level strategy from low-level execution and leverages a Predictive Processing mechanism to anticipate outcomes. The core innovation of our work is a self-correction mechanism that empowers the agent to perform not only Path Correction for local execution errors but also Plan Correction by identifying, discarding, and reformulating the entire plan when it proves ineffective. We conduct extensive experiments on three challenging multi-hop KGQA benchmarks: GrailQA, CWQ, and WebQSP. The results demonstrate that PPoGA achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods. Our work highlights the critical importance of metacognitive abilities like problem restructuring for building more robust and flexible AI reasoning systems."}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer transformative potential for data processing, they face significant limitations in clinical settings, particularly regarding context grounding and hallucinations. Current solutions typically isolate retrieval methods focusing either on structured data (SQL/Cypher) or unstructured semantic search but fail to integrate both simultaneously. This work presents MediGRAF (Medical Graph Retrieval Augmented Framework), a novel hybrid Graph RAG system that bridges this gap. By uniquely combining Neo4j Text2Cypher capabilities for structured relationship traversal with vector embeddings for unstructured narrative retrieval, MediGRAF enables natural language querying of the complete patient journey. Using 10 patients from the MIMIC-IV dataset (generating 5,973 nodes and 5,963 relationships), we generated enough nodes and data for patient level question answering (QA), and we evaluated this architecture across varying query complexities. The system demonstrated 100\\% recall for factual queries which means all relevant information was retrieved and in the output, while complex inference tasks achieved a mean expert quality score of 4.25/5 with zero safety violations.

ZEST generalizes across behaviors and platforms while avoiding contact labels, reference or observation windows, state estimators, and extensive reward shaping. Its training pipeline combines adaptive sampling, which focuses training on difficult motion segments, and an automatic curriculum using a model-based assistive wrench, together enabling dynamic, long-horizon maneuvers. We further provide a procedure for selecting joint-level gains from approximate analytical armature values for closed-chain actuators, along with a refined model of actuators. Trained entirely in simulation with moderate domain randomization, ZEST demonstrates remarkable generality. On Boston Dynamics' Atlas humanoid, ZEST learns dynamic, multi-contact skills (e.g., army crawl, breakdancing) from motion capture. It transfers expressive dance and scene-interaction skills, such as box-climbing, directly from videos to Atlas and the Unitree G1.

A relationship between fundamental fluidic element properties and individual robotic agent states is developed such that the corresponding swarm \"flows\" through a space, akin to a fluid when forced via a pressure boundary condition. By ascribing fluid-like properties to subsets of agents, the swarm evolves collectively while maintaining desirable structure and coherence without explicit communication of agent states within or outside of the swarm. The approach is evaluated using simulations involving $O(10^3)$ quadcopter agents and compared against Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solutions for a converging-diverging domain. Quantitative agreement between swarm-derived and CFD fields is assessed using Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), yielding normalized errors of 0.15-0.9 for velocity, 0.61-0.98 for density, 0-0.937 for pressure.

By integrating visual perception, language understanding, and action planning, they enable general-purpose task execution across diverse environments. Despite their importance, the security of VLA models remains underexplored -- particularly in the context of backdoor attacks, which pose realistic threats in physical-world deployments. While recent methods attempt to inject backdoors into VLA models, these backdoors are easily erased during downstream adaptation, as user-side fine-tuning with clean data significantly alters model parameters, rendering them impractical for real-world applications. To address these challenges, we propose INFUSE (INjection into Fine-tUne-inSensitive modulEs), the first backdoor attack framework for VLA base models that remains effective even with arbitrary user fine-tuning. INFUSE begins by analyzing parameter sensitivity across diverse fine-tuning scenarios to identify modules that remain largely unchanged -- the fine-tune-insensitive modules. It then injects backdoors into these stable modules while freezing the rest, ensuring malicious behavior persists after extensive user fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments across multiple VLA architectures demonstrate INFUSE's effectiveness. After user-side fine-tuning, INFUSE maintains mean attack success rates of 91.0% on simulation environments and 79.8% on real-world robot tasks, substantially surpassing BadVLA (38.8% and 36.6%, respectively), while preserving clean-task performance comparable to standard models. These results uncover a critical threat: backdoors implanted before distribution can persist through fine-tuning and remain effective at deployment."}

Our analysis reveals a commonly overlooked limitation of standard RAG systems: they underutilize retrieved context diversity, such that increasing retrieval diversity alone does not yield diverse generations. To address this limitation, we propose DIVERGE, a plug-and-play agentic RAG framework with novel reflection-guided generation and memory-augmented iterative refinement, which promotes diverse viewpoints while preserving answer quality. We introduce novel metrics tailored to evaluating the diversity-quality trade-off in open-ended questions, and show that they correlate well with human judgments.

Unlike existing visuo-tactile sensors, LVTG enables more effective and stable grasping of larger and heavier everyday objects, thanks to its enhanced tactile sensing area and greater opening angle. Its surface skin is made of highly wear-resistant material, significantly improving durability and extending operational lifespan. The integration of vision and tactile feedback allows LVTG to provide rich, high-fidelity sensory data, facilitating reliable perception during complex manipulation tasks. Furthermore, LVTG features a modular design that supports rapid maintenance and replacement. To effectively fuse vision and touch, We adopt a CLIP-inspired contrastive learning objective to align tactile embeddings with their corresponding visual observations, enabling a shared cross-modal representation space for visuo-tactile perception. This alignment improves the performance of an Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) policy in contact-rich manipulation, leading to more efficient data collection and more effective policy learning.

We introduce the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating UQ metrics in reasoning-demanding QA studying calibration of UQ methods, providing an extensible open-source framework to reproducibly assess calibration. Our study spans up to 20 large language models of base, instruction-tuned and reasoning variants. Our analysis covers seven scientific QA datasets, including both multiple-choice and arithmetic question answering tasks, using prompting to emulate an open question answering setting. We evaluate and compare methods representative of prominent approaches on a total of 685,000 long-form responses, spanning different reasoning complexities representative of domain-specific tasks. At the token level, we find that instruction tuning induces strong probability mass polarization, reducing the reliability of token-level confidences as estimates of uncertainty. Models further fine-tuned for reasoning are exposed to the same effect, but the reasoning process appears to mitigate it depending on the provider. At the sequence level, we show that verbalized approaches are systematically biased and poorly correlated with correctness, while answer frequency (consistency across samples) yields the most reliable calibration. In the wake of our analysis, we study and report the misleading effect of relying exclusively on ECE as a sole measure for judging performance of UQ methods on benchmark datasets.

However, our work shows that LLMs tend to rely on inherent linguistic patterns, which can override contextual information encoded in the hidden representations during decoding. For example, even when a hidden representation encodes the contextual attribute \"purple\" for \"broccoli\", LLMs still generate \"green\" in their explanations, reflecting a strong prior association. This behavior reveals a systematic unfaithfulness in Patchscopes. To systematically study this issue, we first designed a dataset to evaluate the faithfulness of Patchscopes under biased cases, and our results show that there is an 18.84\\% faithfulness decrease on average. We then propose Bias Alignment through Logit Recalibration (BALOR), which treats the output logits from an unpatched prompt as capturing model bias and contrasts them with logits obtained under patched contextual information. By recalibrating the logit distribution through this contrast, BALOR suppresses model bias and amplifies contextual information during generation. Experiments across multiple LLMs demonstrate that BALOR consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving up to 33\\% relative performance improvement."}

Prior work leverages VQ-VAE based frameworks to learn latent actions from human videos in an unsupervised manner. Nevertheless, since the training objective primarily focuses on reconstructing visual appearances rather than capturing inter-frame dynamics, the learned representations tend to rely on spurious visual cues, leading to shortcut learning and entangled latent representations that hinder transferability. To address this, we propose ConLA, an unsupervised pretraining framework for learning robotic policies from human videos. ConLA introduces a contrastive disentanglement mechanism that leverages action category priors and temporal cues to isolate motion dynamics from visual content, effectively mitigating shortcut learning. Extensive experiments show that ConLA achieves strong performance across diverse benchmarks. Notably, by pretraining solely on human videos, our method for the first time surpasses the performance obtained with real robot trajectory pretraining, highlighting its ability to extract pure and semantically consistent latent action representations for scalable robot learning."}

In this paper, we propose a two-stage pipeline for metadata extraction from municipal minutes. First, a question answering (QA) model identifies the opening and closing text segments containing metadata. Transformer-based models (BERTimbau and XLM-RoBERTa with and without a CRF layer) are then applied for fine-grained entity extraction and enhanced through deslexicalization. To evaluate our proposed pipeline, we benchmark both open-weight (Phi) and closed-weight (Gemini) LLMs, assessing predictive performance, inference cost, and carbon footprint. Our results demonstrate strong in-domain performance, better than larger general-purpose LLMs. However, cross-municipality evaluation reveals reduced generalization reflecting the variability and linguistic complexity of municipal records.

Despite this underlying commonality, existing approaches typically adopt specialized model designs, which hinders cross-task generalization and system scalability. More critically, this separation overlooks the potential mutual benefits among tasks. Motivated by these observations, we propose UniMotion, a unified motion framework that captures shared structures across motion tasks while accommodating their individual requirements. Built on a decoder-only Transformer architecture, UniMotion employs dedicated interaction modes and tailored training strategies to simultaneously support these motion tasks. This unified design not only enables joint optimization and representation sharing but also allows for targeted fine-tuning to specialize in individual tasks when needed. Extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that joint training leads to robust generalization and effective task integration.

We observe minimal detection of AI-generated content before 2022, followed by a substantial increase through 2025, with approximately 20% of ICLR reviews and 12% of Nature Communications reviews classified as AI-generated in 2025. The most pronounced growth of AI-generated reviews in NC occurs between the third and fourth quarter of 2024. Together, these findings provide suggestive evidence of a rapidly increasing presence of AI-assisted content in peer review and highlight the need for further study of its implications for scholarly evaluation."}

To address these challenges, we advocate for a paradigm shift from passive evaluation to Agentic Interactive Verification. We introduce VAGEN, a framework that employs a verifier agent equipped with interaction tools to autonomously plan verification strategies and proactively probe the environment for evidence of task completion. Leveraging the insight that GUI tasks are typically \"easy to verify but hard to solve\", VAGEN overcomes the bottlenecks of visual limitations. Experimental results on OSWorld-Verified and AndroidWorld benchmarks demonstrate that VAGEN significantly improves evaluation accuracy compared to LLM-as-a-Judge baselines and further enhances performance through test-time scaling strategies."}

In this paper we introduce JANUS, a cognitive architecture for assistive robots that models interaction as a partially observable Markov decision process and realizes control as a factored controller with typed interfaces. To this aim, Janus (i) decomposes the overall behavior into specialized modules, related to scope detection, intent recognition, memory, inner speech, query generation, and outer speech, and (ii) exposes explicit policies for information sufficiency, execution readiness, and tool grounding. A dedicated memory agent maintains a bounded recent-history buffer, a compact core memory, and an archival store with semantic retrieval, coupled through controlled consolidation and revision policies. Models inspired by the notion of inner speech in cognitive theories provide a control-oriented internal textual flow that validates parameter completeness and triggers clarification before grounding, while a faithfulness constraint ties robot-to-human claims to an evidence bundle combining working context and retrieved tool outputs. We evaluate JANUS through module-level unit tests in a dietary assistance domain grounded on a knowledge graph, reporting high agreement with curated references and practical latency profiles. These results support factored reasoning as a promising path to scalable, auditable, and evidence-grounded robot assistance over extended interaction horizons."}

We introduce DecompressionLM, a stateless framework for zero-shot concept graph extraction that discovers what language models encode without pre-specified queries or shared cross-sequence state. Our method targets three limitations of common decoding-based probing approaches: cross-sequence coupling that concentrates probability mass on high-frequency prefixes, competitive decoding effects that suppress long-tail concepts, and scalability constraints arising from sequential exploration. Using Van der Corput low-discrepancy sequences with arithmetic decoding, DecompressionLM enables deterministic, embarrassingly parallel generation without shared state across sequences. Across two model families and five quantization variants, we find that activation-aware quantization (AWQ-4bit) expands concept coverage by 30-170%, while uniform quantization (GPTQ-Int4) induces 71-86% coverage collapse -- divergent behaviors not reliably reflected by explanation-level perplexity. Corpus-based verification further reveals a 17-point hallucination gap between top- and bottom-ranked MMLU-Pro Law models. DecompressionLM establishes concept coverage as a complementary evaluation dimension for assessing knowledge breadth and factual grounding in compressed models useful for their deployment."}

To address these challenges, we introduce a unified framework encompassing a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) locomotion policy for robust multi-terrain representation with RoboGauge, a predictive assessment suite that quantifies sim-to-real transferability. The MoE policy employs a gated set of specialist experts to decompose latent terrain and command modeling, achieving superior deployment robustness and generalization via proprioception alone. RoboGauge further provides multi-dimensional proprioception-based metrics via sim-to-sim tests over terrains, difficulty levels, and domain randomizations, enabling reliable MoE policy selection without extensive physical trials. Experiments on a Unitree Go2 demonstrate robust locomotion on unseen challenging terrains, including snow, sand, stairs, slopes, and 30 cm obstacles. In dedicated high-speed tests, the robot reaches 4 m/s and exhibits an emergent narrow-width gait associated with improved stability at high velocity."}

Improving inference efficiency is therefore essential for practical robotic applications. Existing acceleration methods often rely on heuristic or static strategies--such as rule-based token caching or pruning--that are decoupled from task objectives and fail to adapt to dynamic scene changes. In this work, we reformulate inference acceleration as a learnable policy optimization problem and propose a novel framework that integrates a dynamic, task-aware decision-making process directly into the VLA model. At its core are two lightweight, cooperative modules: a Cached Token Selector, which determines which tokens should be reused, and a Cache Ratio Predictor, which controls how many tokens to reuse. Training these modules is non-trivial due to their discrete decisions. We address this by adopting a differentiable relaxation that allows gradient-based end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO and SIMPLER benchmarks, as well as real-robot evaluations, show that our method achieves a 1.76x wall-clock inference speedup while simultaneously improving the average success rate by 1.9 percentage points (from 75.0% to 76.9%) on LIBERO and by 5.0 percentage points on real-world tasks, significantly outperforming existing baselines. This work highlights the potential of learning task-aware computational allocation policies, paving the way for VLA models that are both powerful and efficient."}

To this end, we incorporate integrated gradient attribution to quantify each token's influence on final answers and aggregate them into two segment-level metrics: (1) \\textit{attribution strength} measures the overall attribution magnitude; and (2) \\textit{direction consistency} captures whether tokens' attributions within a segment are uniformly positive or negative (high consistency), or a mixture of both (moderate consistency). Based on these two metrics, we propose a segment-level selective learning framework to identify important segments with high attribution strength but moderate consistency that indicate reflective rather than shallow reasoning. The framework then applies selective SFT on these important segments while masking loss for unimportant ones. Experiments across multiple models and datasets show that our approach improves accuracy and output efficiency, enabling more effective learning from long reasoning traces~\\footnote{Code and data are available at https://github.com/SiyuanWangw/SegmentSelectiveSFT}."}

However, within these multi-agent systems, the susceptibility of agents to collective cognitive biases remains an underexplored issue. A compelling example is the Mandela effect, a phenomenon where groups collectively misremember past events as a result of false details reinforced through social influence and internalized misinformation. This vulnerability limits our understanding of memory bias in multi-agent systems and raises ethical concerns about the potential spread of misinformation. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the Mandela effect in LLM-based multi-agent systems, focusing on its existence, causing factors, and mitigation strategies. We propose MANBENCH, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate agent behaviors across four common task types that are susceptible to the Mandela effect, using five interaction protocols that vary in agent roles and memory timescales. We evaluate agents powered by several LLMs on MANBENCH to quantify the Mandela effect and analyze how different factors affect it. Moreover, we propose strategies to mitigate this effect, including prompt-level defenses (e.g., cognitive anchoring and source scrutiny) and model-level alignment-based defense, achieving an average 74.40% reduction in the Mandela effect compared to the baseline. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more resilient and ethically aligned collaborative multi-agent systems."}

To address this issue, we propose \\textbf{SA-VLA}, a spatially-aware RL adaptation framework that preserves spatial grounding during policy optimization by aligning representation learning, reward design, and exploration with task geometry.

These reveal that LLMs converge on consistent importance patterns, sharply different from pre-LLM baselines, and that LLMs cluster more by family than by size. Computationally, we identify that certain attention heads align well with empirical importance distributions, and that middle-to-late layers are strongly predictive of importance. Together, these results provide initial insights into what LLMs prioritize in summarization and how this priority is internally represented, opening a path toward interpreting and ultimately controlling information selection in these models."}

First, we introduce a Diffusion Mamba Transformer architecture that embeds mamba and attention into the diffusion process, enabling more effective aggregation of sequential input contexts from sensor streams and past motion histories. Second, we design a Port-Hamiltonian Neural Network module that seamlessly integrates energy-based physical constraints into the diffusion model, thereby enhancing trajectory predictions with both consistency and interpretability.

To address this issue, we introduce a method to explicitly construct synthetic negatives, representing plausible but non-traversable, and integrate them into vision-based traversability learning.

This scalar is computed along the prediction horizon to gate lightweight cost terms only where the ocean currents truly aids the control goal. The proposed cost terms, that are merged in the objective function, are (i) a Monotone Cost Shaping (MCS) term, a help-gated, non-worsening modification that relaxes along-track position error and provides a bounded translational energy rebate, guaranteeing the shaped objective is never larger than a set baseline, and (ii) a speed-to-fly (STF) cost component that increases the price of thrust and softly matches ground velocity to the ocean current, enabling near zero water-relative \"gliding\".

Current methods for safe control, such as Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability and Control Barrier Functions, assume known system dynamics. Meanwhile existing safe exploration techniques often fail to account for the unavoidable stochasticity inherent when operating in unknown real world environments, such as an exploratory rover skidding over an unseen surface or a household robot pushing around unmapped objects in a pantry. To address this critical gap, we propose Safe Stochastic Explorer (S.S.Explorer) a novel framework for safe, goal-driven exploration under stochastic dynamics. Our approach strategically balances safety and information gathering to reduce uncertainty about safety in the unknown environment. We employ Gaussian Processes to learn the unknown safety function online, leveraging their predictive uncertainty to guide information-gathering actions and provide probabilistic bounds on safety violations. We first present our method for discrete state space environments and then introduce a scalable relaxation to effectively extend this approach to continuous state spaces. Finally we demonstrate how this framework can be naturally applied to ensure safe physical interaction with multiple unknown objects. Extensive validation in simulation and demonstrative hardware experiments showcase the efficacy of our method, representing a step forward toward enabling reliable widespread robot autonomy in complex, uncertain environments."}

Drawing on cross-cultural perspectives in human-centered computing and AI governance, this paper synthesizes existing evidence on multilingual model behavior, data asymmetries, and sociotechnical harm, and articulates a culturally grounded governance framework for MLLMs. We identify three interrelated governance challenges: cultural and linguistic inequities in training data and evaluation practices, misalignment between global deployment and locally situated norms, values, and power structures, and limited accountability mechanisms for addressing harms experienced by marginalized language communities. Rather than proposing new technical benchmarks, we contribute a conceptual agenda that reframes multilingual AI governance as a sociocultural and rights based problem. We outline design and policy implications for data stewardship, transparency, and participatory accountability, and argue that culturally grounded governance is essential for ensuring that multilingual language models do not reproduce existing global inequalities under the guise of scale and neutrality."}

Achieving such behavior requires path planning that explicitly models complex motion dynamics, whereas existing methods often neglect this aspect and plan solely based on positions or a fixed velocity. To address this gap, we introduce Motion-aware Traversability (MAT) representation to explicitly model terrain cost conditioned on actual robot motion. Instead of assigning a single scalar score for traversability, MAT models each terrain region as a Gaussian function of velocity. During online planning, we decompose the terrain cost computation into two stages: (1) predict terrain-dependent Gaussian parameters from perception in a single forward pass, (2) efficiently update terrain costs for new velocities inferred from current dynamics by evaluating these functions without repeated inference. We develop a system that integrates MAT to enable agile off-road navigation and evaluate it in both simulated and real-world environments with various obstacles. Results show that MAT achieves real-time efficiency and enhances the performance of off-road navigation, reducing path detours by 75% while maintaining safety across challenging terrains."}

Kanade separates out acoustic constants to create a single stream of tokens that captures rich phonetics and prosody. It does so without the need for auxiliary methods that existing disentangled codecs often rely on.

Here we abstract these features to test their functional advantages for a novel low-cost gripper design, suitable for bin-picking applications. In our implementation, the gripper legs are long and slim, with high friction gripping pads, low friction hairs and single-segment tarsus-like structure to mimic the insect's setal pads, hairs, and the tarsi's interactive compliance. Experimental evaluation shows this design is highly robust for grasping a wide variety of individual consumer objects, with all grasp attempts successful. In addition, we demonstrate this design is effective for picking single objects from dense clutter, a task at which ants also show high competence.

However, as probabilistic models, they still struggle to generate syntactically valid outputs reliably. A natural and promising direction to address this issue is to adapt constrained decoding techniques to enforce grammatical correctness during generation. However, applying these techniques faces two primary obstacles. On the one hand, the non-autoregressive nature of dLLMs renders most existing constrained decoding approaches inapplicable. On the other hand, current approaches specifically designed for dLLMs may allow intermediate outputs that are impossible to complete into valid sentences, which significantly limits their reliability in practice.\n  To address these challenges, we present LAVE, a constrained decoding approach specifically designed for dLLMs. Our approach leverages a key property of dLLMs, namely their ability to predict token distributions for all positions in parallel during each forward pass. Whenever a new token is proposed by model, LAVE performs lookahead using these distributions to efficiently and reliably verify the validity of the proposed token. This design ensures reliable constraints by reliably preserving the potential for intermediate outputs to be extended into valid sentences. Extensive experiments across four widely used dLLMs and three representative benchmarks demonstrate that LAVE consistently outperforms existing baselines and achieves substantial improvements in syntactic correctness, while incurring negligible runtime overhead."}

In this work, we introduce Contrastive Learning for 3D Multi-View Action-Conditioned Robotic Manipulation Pretraining (CLAMP), a novel 3D pre-training framework that utilizes point clouds and robot actions. From the merged point cloud computed from RGB-D images and camera extrinsics, we re-render multi-view four-channel image observations with depth and 3D coordinates, including dynamic wrist views, to provide clearer views of target objects for high-precision manipulation tasks. The pre-trained encoders learn to associate the 3D geometric and positional information of objects with robot action patterns via contrastive learning on large-scale simulated robot trajectories. During encoder pre-training, we pre-train a Diffusion Policy to initialize the policy weights for fine-tuning, which is essential for improving fine-tuning sample efficiency and performance. After pre-training, we fine-tune the policy on a limited amount of task demonstrations using the learned image and action representations. We demonstrate that this pre-training and fine-tuning design substantially improves learning efficiency and policy performance on unseen tasks.

However, existing studies face practical challenges in achieving complex shape representation and decentralized implementation. This motivates us to develop a fully decentralized, distribution-based control strategy with the dual capability of forming complex shapes and adapting to swarm-size variations. Specifically, we first propose a discrete mass-distribution function defined over a set of sample points to model swarm formation. In contrast to the continuous density-distribution method, our model eliminates the requirement for defining continuous density functions-a task that is difficult for complex shapes. Second, we design a decentralized meanshift control law to coordinate the swarm's global distribution to fit the sample-point distribution by feeding back mass estimates. The mass estimates for all sample points are achieved by the robots in a decentralized manner via the designed mass estimator. It is shown that the mass estimates of the sample points can asymptotically converge to the true global values. To validate the proposed strategy, we conduct comprehensive simulations and real-world experiments to evaluate the efficiency of complex shape formation and adaptability to swarm-size variations."}

Conventional numerical methods for computing such paths do not scale well to high-dimensional systems, while sampling-based planners trade scalability for geometric fidelity. To bridge this gap, we propose a sampling-based motion planning framework that operates directly on Riemannian manifolds. We introduce a computationally efficient midpoint-based approximation of the Riemannian geodesic distance and prove that it matches the true Riemannian distance with third-order accuracy. Building on this approximation, we design a local planner that traces the manifold using first-order retractions guided by Riemannian natural gradients.

LegalOne is developed through a comprehensive three-phase pipeline designed to master legal reasoning. First, during mid-training phase, we propose Plasticity-Adjusted Sampling (PAS) to address the challenge of domain adaptation. This perplexity-based scheduler strikes a balance between the acquisition of new knowledge and the retention of original capabilities, effectively establishing a robust legal foundation.

Through a progressive reinforcement process spanning memorization, understanding, and reasoning, LegalOne evolves from simple pattern matching to autonomous and reliable legal reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that LegalOne achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of legal tasks, surpassing general-purpose LLMs with vastly larger parameter counts through enhanced knowledge density and efficiency.

The framework commences with a two-stage, weakly supervised skill discovery process: Stage one performs coarse, task-aware macro-segmentation by employing an alignment-enforced Vector Quantized VAE guided by weak task labels. Stage two then refines these segments at a micro-level using a self-supervised sequential model, followed by an iterative clustering process to consolidate skill boundaries. The third stage then leverages these precise boundaries to construct a hierarchical policy within an option-based framework-complete with a learned termination condition beta for explicit skill switching. LOKI achieves high success rates on the challenging D4RL Kitchen benchmark and outperforms standard HIL baselines.

Conventional learning approaches often struggle to separate task-relevant features from domain-specific variations (e.g., lighting, field-of-view, and rotation), leading to poor sample efficiency and catastrophic failure in unseen environments. To bridge this gap, we propose ContrAstive Prompt Orchestration (CAPO), a novel approach for learning visuomotor policies that integrates contrastive prompt learning and adaptive prompt orchestration. For prompt learning, we devise a hybrid contrastive learning strategy that integrates visual, temporal action, and text objectives to establish a pool of learnable prompts, where each prompt induces a visual representation encapsulating fine-grained domain factors. Based on these learned prompts, we introduce an adaptive prompt orchestration mechanism that dynamically aggregates these prompts conditioned on current observations. This enables the agent to adaptively construct optimal state representations by identifying dominant domain factors instantaneously. Consequently, the policy optimization is effectively shielded from irrelevant interference, preventing the common issue of overfitting to source domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in sample efficiency and asymptotic performance. Crucially, it exhibits superior zero-shot adaptation across unseen target domains characterized by drastic environmental (e.g., illumination) and physical shifts (e.g., field-of-view and rotation), validating its effectiveness as a viable solution for cross-embodiment visuomotor policy adaptation."}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for task planning and BT generation. However, most existing approaches remain confined to simulations or simple manipulators, with relatively few applications demonstrated in real-world contexts, such as complex construction sites involving multiple machines. This paper proposes an LLM-based workflow for BT generation, introducing synchronization flags to enable safe and cooperative operation. The workflow consists of two steps: high-level planning, where the LLM generates synchronization flags, and BT generation using structured templates. Safety is ensured by planning with parameters stored in the system database. The proposed method is validated in simulation and further demonstrated through real-world experiments, highlighting its potential to advance automation in civil engineering."}

Instead of simply recalling past examples, ExperienceWeaver distills noisy, multi-dimensional feedback into structured, actionable knowledge. Specifically, error-specific Tips and high-level Strategies. By injecting this distilled experience into an agentic pipeline, the model learns \"how to revise\" rather than just \"what to revise\".

To expand this coverage without costly additional data collection, recent work relies on co-training: jointly learning from target robot data and heterogeneous data modalities. However, how different co-training data modalities and strategies affect policy performance remains poorly understood. We present a large-scale empirical study examining five co-training data modalities: standard vision-language data, dense language annotations for robot trajectories, cross-embodiment robot data, human videos, and discrete robot action tokens across single- and multi-phase training strategies. Our study leverages 4,000 hours of robot and human manipulation data and 50M vision-language samples to train vision-language-action policies. We evaluate 89 policies over 58,000 simulation rollouts and 2,835 real-world rollouts. Our results show that co-training with forms of vision-language and cross-embodiment robot data substantially improves generalization to distribution shifts, unseen tasks, and language following, while discrete action token variants yield no significant benefits. Combining effective modalities produces cumulative gains and enables rapid adaptation to unseen long-horizon dexterous tasks via fine-tuning. Training exclusively on robot data degrades the visiolinguistic understanding of the vision-language model backbone, while co-training with effective modalities restores these capabilities. Explicitly conditioning action generation on chain-of-thought traces learned from co-training data does not improve performance in our simulation benchmark. Together, these results provide practical guidance for building scalable generalist robot policies."}

In many robot-wire interaction tasks, contact occurs not at the end-effector but at other points along the robot's body. Such scenarios arise when robots manipulate wires indirectly (e.g., by nudging) or when wires act as passive obstacles in the environment. Accurately identifying these interactions is crucial for safe and efficient trajectory planning, helping to prevent wire damage, avoid restricted robot motions, and mitigate potential hazards. Existing approaches often rely on expensive external force-torque sensor or that contacts occur at the end-effector for accurate force estimation. Using wire shape information acquired from a depth camera and under the assumption that the wire is in or near its static equilibrium, our method estimates both the location and magnitude of external forces without additional prior knowledge. This is achieved by exploiting derived consistency conditions and solving a system of linear equations based on force-torque balance along the wire. The approach was validated through simulation, where it achieved high accuracy, and through real-world experiments, where accurate estimation was demonstrated in selected interaction scenarios."}

To address this, we propose Decouple Searching from Training Mix (DeMix), a novel framework that leverages model merging to predict optimal data ratios. Instead of training proxy models for every sampled mixture, DeMix trains component models on candidate datasets at scale and derives data mixture proxies via weighted model merging. This paradigm decouples search from training costs, enabling evaluation of unlimited sampled mixtures without extra training burden and thus facilitating better mixture discovery through more search trials. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeMix breaks the trade-off between sufficiency, accuracy and efficiency, obtaining the optimal mixture with higher benchmark performance at lower search cost.

The framework is trained entirely from heterogeneous offline teleoperation data containing both successful and failed executions. Task feasibility is mod-eled as a conservative success score learned via Conservative Value Learning, yielding a risk-sensitive estimate that remains reliable under distribution shift. During online operation, the learned success score regulates the level of assistance, while a learned actor provides a corrective motion direction. Both are integrated through a joint-space impedance interface on the master side, yielding continuous guidance that steers the operator away from failure-prone actions without overriding intent. Experimental results on contact-rich manipulation tasks demonstrate improved task success rates and reduced operator workload compared to conventional teleoperation and shared-autonomy baselines, indicating that conservative value learning provides an effective mechanism for embedding failure awareness into bilateral teleoperation.

Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often entangle these processes, performing redundant multimodal reasoning at every timestep, which leads to high latency and goal instability. To address this, we present StreamVLA, a dual-system architecture that unifies textual task decomposition, visual goal imagination, and continuous action generation within a single parameter-efficient backbone. We introduce a \"Lock-and-Gated\" mechanism to intelligently modulate computation: only when a sub-task transition is detected, the model triggers slow thinking to generate a textual instruction and imagines the specific visual completion state, rather than generic future frames. Crucially, this completion state serves as a time-invariant goal anchor, making the policy robust to execution speed variations. During steady execution, these high-level intents are locked to condition a Flow Matching action head, allowing the model to bypass expensive autoregressive decoding for 72% of timesteps. This hierarchical abstraction ensures sub-goal focus while significantly reducing inference latency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that StreamVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 98.5% success rate on the LIBERO benchmark and robust recovery in real-world interference scenarios, achieving a 48% reduction in latency compared to full-reasoning baselines."}

Next, we observe that our method functions as a plug-and-play module that can be applied to different RLVR algorithms.

We formally define this specific position where the answer first stabilizes as the Reasoning Anchor. By analyzing pre- and post-anchor reasoning behaviors, we uncover the structural redundancy fixed in LRMs: the meaningless repetitive verification after deriving the first complete answer, which we term the Answer-Stable Tail (AST). Motivated by this observation, we propose Anchor-based Process Reward (APR), a structure-aware reward shaping method that localizes the reasoning anchor and penalizes exclusively the post-anchor AST.

Here, we propose a novel elicitation method based on iterated in-context learning (Zhu and Griffiths, 2024a) and apply it to elicit trustworthiness priors using the Trust Game from behavioral game theory. The Trust Game is particularly well suited for this purpose because it operationalizes trust as voluntary exposure to risk based on beliefs about another agent, rather than self-reported attitudes. Using our method, we elicit trustworthiness priors from several leading large language models (LLMs) and find that GPT-4.1's trustworthiness priors closely track those observed in humans. Building on this result, we further examine how GPT-4.1 responds to different player personas in the Trust Game, providing an initial characterization of how such models differentiate trust across agent characteristics.

Through comprehensive experiments across models at various training stages, we discover that post-training yields only limited improvement in static initial representation quality. Furthermore, we reveal that, distinct from non-reasoning tasks, reasoning involves a significant continuous distributional shift in representations during generation. Comparative analysis indicates that post-training empowers models to drive this transition toward a better distribution for task solving. To clarify the relationship between internal states and external outputs, statistical analysis confirms a high correlation between generation correctness and the final representations; while counterfactual experiments identify the semantics of the generated tokens, rather than additional computation during inference or intrinsic parameter differences, as the dominant driver of the transition. Collectively, we offer a novel understanding of the reasoning process and the effect of training on reasoning enhancement, providing valuable insights for future model analysis and optimization."}

Using Gemini 3.5 Pro, SkySim translates user commands (e.g., \"Form a circle\") into spatial waypoints, informed by real-time drone states. An Artificial Potential Field (APF) safety filter applies minimal adjustments for collision avoidance, kinematic limits, and geo-fencing, ensuring feasible execution at 20 Hz. Experiments with swarms of 3, 10, and 30 Crazyflie drones validate spatial reasoning accuracy (100% across tested geometric primitives), real-time collision prevention, and scalability.

In this paper, we introduce {\\bf HyLRA} ({\\bf Hy}brid {\\bf L}ayer {\\bf R}euse {\\bf A}ttention), a novel framework driven by layer-wise sparsity profiling.

Based on these observations, HyLRA employs an offline dynamic programming approach to derive an optimal layer-wise policy. This hybrid strategy retains full attention for sensitive layers to ensure robustness, while enabling tolerant layers to bypass quadratic calculations by directly reusing top-$k$ indices from preceding layers. This approach allows LLMs to restrict computation to the most critical tokens, effectively overcoming the quadratic bottleneck of dense attention.

Revisiting the foundational principles of active perception, we introduce an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework in which a robot must not only reach a goal while avoiding obstacles, but also actively control its onboard camera to enhance situational awareness. The policy receives observations comprising the robot state, the current depth frame, and a particularly local geometry representation built from a short history of depth readings. To couple collision-free motion planning with information-driven active camera control, we augment the navigation reward with a voxel-based information metric. This enables an aerial robot to learn a robust policy that balances goal-directed motion with exploratory sensing. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our strategy achieves safer flight compared to using fixed, non-actuated camera baselines while also inducing intrinsic exploratory behaviors."}

In this paper, we propose a novel triphibious robot capable of aerial, terrestrial, and aquatic motion, by a minimalist design combining a quadcopter structure with two passive wheels, without extra actuators. To address inefficiency of ground-support motion (moving on land/seabed) for quadcopter based designs, we introduce an eccentric Center of Gravity (CoG) design that inherently aligns thrust with motion, enhancing efficiency without specialized mechanical transformation designs. Furthermore, to address the drastic differences in motion control caused by different fluids (air and water), we develop a unified propulsion system based on Field-Oriented Control (FOC). This method resolves torque matching issues and enables precise, rapid bidirectional thrust across different mediums. Grounded in the perspective of living condition and ground support, we analyse the robot's dynamics and propose a Hybrid Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (HNMPC)-PID control system to ensure stable multi-domain motion and seamless transitions. Experimental results validate the robot's multi-domain motion and cross-mode transition capability, along with the efficiency and adaptability of the proposed propulsion system."}

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge by adapting the network to the robot's target environment without external supervision, leveraging the large amounts of data a robot might naturally collect during long-term operation. In such settings, UDA methods can exploit multi-view consistency across the environment's map to fine-tune the model in an unsupervised fashion and mitigate domain shift. However, these approaches remain sensitive to cross-view instance-level inconsistencies. In this work, we propose a method that starts from a volumetric 3D map to generate multi-view consistent pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels using the zero-shot instance segmentation capabilities of a foundation model, enforcing instance-level coherence. The refined annotations serve as supervision for self-supervised fine-tuning, enabling the robot to adapt its perception system at deployment time.

Unlike open-ended generation, text scoring failures are directly testable: an attack succeeds when an irrelevant or rejected text outscores a relevant or chosen one. Using this principled lens of text scoring, we demonstrate that current adversarial training formulations for language models are often short-sighted, failing to effectively generalize across attacks. To address this, we introduce multiple adversarial training methods for text scoring models and show that combining complementary training methods can yield strong robustness while also improving task effectiveness. We also highlight the practical value of our approach for RLHF, showing that our adversarially trained reward models mitigate reward hacking and support the training of better-aligned LLMs. We provide our code and models for further study."}

While a few laypeople LSI datasets exist, there has been little research to explore the differences between court and laypeople data for LSI. In this work, we create ILSIC, a corpus of laypeople queries covering 500+ statutes from Indian law. Additionally, the corpus also contains court case judgements to enable researchers to effectively compare between court and laypeople data for LSI. We conducted extensive experiments on our corpus, including benchmarking over the laypeople dataset using zero and few-shot inference, retrieval-augmented generation and supervised fine-tuning. We observe that models trained purely on court judgements are ineffective during test on laypeople queries, while transfer learning from court to laypeople data can be beneficial in certain scenarios.

To apply equal and constant pressure across the wound, we developed an inflatable ring and airbag balloon that are compatible with this shape-changing ring mechanism. A series of experiments focused on evaluating various ring arm configurations to characterize their bending stiffness. Subsequent experiments measured the force exerted by the airbag balloon system using a digital scale. Despite its promising performance, certain limitations related to coverage area are identified.

We represent scenes using tree stems and their Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), which are aligned to a common reference frame via their axes and summarized using the tree distribution histogram (TDH) for coarse matching, followed by fine matching with a 2D triangle descriptor. Finally, pose estimation is achieved through a two-step geometric verification. On diverse forest benchmarks, TreeLoc outperforms baselines, achieving precise localization.

HO categories are learnable from single sentences (e.g., the easiest bipolar pair reaches Macro-$F_1\\approx0.58$), but hard hierarchical gating is not a reliable win: it often reduces end-task Macro-$F_1$ via error compounding and recall suppression. In contrast, label-wise threshold tuning is a high-leverage knob (up to $+0.05$ Macro-$F_1$), and small transformer ensembles provide the most consistent additional gains (up to $+0.02$ Macro-$F_1$). Small LLMs lag behind supervised encoders as stand-alone systems, yet can contribute complementary errors in cross-family ensembles.

Although anomaly detection can mitigate these failures, prior methods are often incompatible with high-rate control, poorly calibrated at the extremely low false-positive rates required for practical deployment, or operate as black boxes that provide a binary stop signal without explaining why the robot drifted from nominal behavior. We present RAPT, a lightweight, self-supervised deployment-time monitor for 50Hz humanoid control. RAPT learns a probabilistic spatio-temporal manifold of nominal execution from simulation and evaluates execution-time predictive deviation as a calibrated, per-dimension signal. This yields (i) reliable online OOD detection under strict false-positive constraints and (ii) a continuous, interpretable measure of Sim-to-Real mismatch that can be tracked over time to quantify how far deployment has drifted from training. Beyond detection, we introduce an automated post-hoc root-cause analysis pipeline that combines gradient-based temporal saliency derived from RAPT's reconstruction objective with LLM-based reasoning conditioned on saliency and joint kinematics to produce semantic failure diagnoses in a zero-shot setting. We evaluate RAPT on a Unitree G1 humanoid across four complex tasks in simulation and on physical hardware. In large-scale simulation, RAPT improves True Positive Rate (TPR) by 37% over the strongest baseline at a fixed episode-level false positive rate of 0.5%.

For example, Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations are often confined to single-wheel tests, which obscures coupled wheel-vehicle-controller interactions and prevents joint optimization of mechanical design and control. This paper presents a Bayesian optimization framework that co-designs rover wheel geometry and steering controller parameters using high-fidelity, full-vehicle closed-loop simulations on deformable terrain. Using the efficiency and scalability of a continuum-representation model (CRM) for terramechanics, we evaluate candidate designs on trajectories of varying complexity while towing a fixed load. The optimizer tunes wheel parameters (radius, width, and grouser features) and steering PID gains under a multi-objective formulation that balances traversal speed, tracking error, and energy consumption. We compare two strategies: simultaneous co-optimization of wheel and controller parameters versus a sequential approach that decouples mechanical and control design. We analyze trade-offs in performance and computational cost. Across 3,000 full-vehicle simulations, campaigns finish in five to nine days, versus months with the group's earlier DEM-based workflow. Finally, a preliminary hardware study suggests the simulation-optimized wheel designs preserve relative performance trends on the physical rover. Together, these results show that scalable, high-fidelity simulation can enable practical co-optimization of wheel design and control for off-road vehicles on deformable terrain without relying on prohibitively expensive DEM studies.

Neural FOXP2 proceeds in three stages: (i) Localize: We train per-layer SAEs so each activation decomposes into a small set of active feature components. For every feature, we quantify English vs. Hindi/Spanish selectivity overall logit-mass lift toward the target-language token set. Tracing the top-ranked features back to their strongest contributing units yields a compact language-neuron set. (ii) Steering directions: We localize controllable language-shift geometry via a spectral low-rank analysis. For each layer, we build English to target activation-difference matrices and perform layerwise SVD to extract the dominant singular directions governing language change. The eigengap and effective-rank spectra identify a compact steering subspace and an empirically chosen intervention window (where these directions are strongest and most stable).

Prior work largely studies either unverifiable cheap-talk or fully verifiable disclosure, failing to capture realistic domains in which information has probabilistic credibility. We introduce MixTalk, a strategic communication game for LLM-to-LLM interaction that models information credibility. In MixTalk, a sender agent strategically combines verifiable and unverifiable claims to communicate private information, while a receiver agent allocates a limited budget to costly verification and infers the underlying state from prior beliefs, claims, and verification outcomes. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLM agents in large-scale tournaments across three realistic deployment settings, revealing their strengths and limitations in reasoning about information credibility and the explicit behavior that shapes these interactions. Finally, we propose Tournament Oracle Policy Distillation (TOPD), an offline method that distills tournament oracle policy from interaction logs and deploys it in-context at inference time. Our results show that TOPD significantly improves receiver robustness to persuasion."}

This is due to optimizing to match robot end-effector to human hand position and orientation, which can also limit the robot's workspace to that of the human. Instead, this paper reframes retargeting as an orientation alignment problem, enabling a closed-form, geometric solution algorithm with an optimality guarantee. The key idea is to align a robot arm to a human's upper and lower arm orientations, as identified from shoulder, elbow, and wrist (SEW) keypoints; hence, the method is called SEW-Mimic. The method has fast inference (3 kHz) on standard commercial CPUs, leaving computational overhead for downstream applications; an example in this paper is a safety filter to avoid bimanual self-collision. The method suits most 7-degree-of-freedom robot arms and humanoids, and is agnostic to input keypoint source. Experiments show that SEW-Mimic outperforms other retargeting methods in computation time and accuracy. A pilot user study suggests that the method improves teleoperation task success. Preliminary analysis indicates that data collected with SEW-Mimic improves policy learning due to being smoother. SEW-Mimic is also shown to be a drop-in way to accelerate full-body humanoid retargeting. Finally, hardware demonstrations illustrate SEW-Mimic's practicality. The results emphasize the utility of SEW-Mimic as a fundamental building block for bimanual robot manipulation and humanoid robot teleoperation."}

In this work, we present Structural Confidence, a single-pass, model-agnostic framework that enhances output correctness prediction based on multi-scale structural signals derived from a model's final-layer hidden-state trajectory. By combining spectral, local-variation, and global shape descriptors, our method captures internal stability patterns that are missed by probabilities and sentence embeddings. We conduct extensive, cross-domain evaluation across four heterogeneous benchmarks-FEVER (fact verification), SciFact (scientific claims), WikiBio-hallucination (biographical consistency), and TruthfulQA (truthfulness-oriented QA). Our Structural Confidence framework demonstrates strong performance compared with established baselines in terms of AUROC and AUPR.

A custom dataset comprising 31 surgical instruments and 6,975 annotated images was collected to train a hybrid perception pipeline using YOLO12 for detection and a cascaded ResNet-based model for fine-grained classification. The system integrates a calibrated vision module, a 6-DOF Staubli TX2-60L robotic arm with a custom dual electromagnetic gripper, and a rule-based packing algorithm that reduces instrument collisions during transport. The packing framework uses 3D printed dividers and holders to physically isolate instruments, reducing collision and friction during transport.

Current approaches in this domain present a clear trade-off: PPO-style methods (e.g., GRPO/DAPO) offer training stability but exhibit slow learning trajectories due to their trust-region constraints on policy updates, while REINFORCE-style approaches (e.g., CISPO) demonstrate improved learning efficiency but suffer from performance instability as they clip importance sampling weights while still permitting non-zero gradients outside the trust-region. To address these limitations, we introduce DISPO, a simple yet effective REINFORCE-style algorithm that decouples the up-clipping and down-clipping of importance sampling weights for correct and incorrect responses, yielding four controllable policy update regimes. Through targeted ablations, we uncover how each regime impacts training: for correct responses, weights >1 increase the average token entropy (i.e., exploration) while weights <1 decrease it (i.e., distillation) -- both beneficial but causing gradual performance degradation when excessive. For incorrect responses, overly restrictive clipping triggers sudden performance collapse through repetitive outputs (when weights >1) or vanishing response lengths (when weights <1). By separately tuning these four clipping parameters, DISPO maintains the exploration-distillation balance while preventing catastrophic failures, achieving 61.04% on AIME'24 (vs. 55.42% CISPO and 50.21% DAPO) with similar gains across various benchmarks and models."}

A key limitation of existing approaches is that task reasoning is implicitly embedded in high-dimensional latent representations, making it challenging to separate task structure from perceptual variability. We introduce Grounded Scene-graph Reasoning (GSR), a structured reasoning paradigm that explicitly models world-state evolution as transitions over semantically grounded scene graphs. By reasoning step-wise over object states and spatial relations, rather than directly mapping perception to actions, GSR enables explicit reasoning about action preconditions, consequences, and goal satisfaction in a physically grounded space. To support learning such reasoning, we construct Manip-Cognition-1.6M, a large-scale dataset that jointly supervises world understanding, action planning, and goal interpretation. Extensive evaluations across RLBench, LIBERO, GSR-benchmark, and real-world robotic tasks show that GSR significantly improves zero-shot generalization and long-horizon task completion over prompting-based baselines. These results highlight explicit world-state representations as a key inductive bias for scalable embodied reasoning."}

Our experiments reveal that these value neurons are robust across diverse datasets, model scales, and architectures; furthermore, they exhibit significant transferability across different datasets and models fine-tuned from the same base model. By examining cases where value predictions and actual rewards diverge, we identify dopamine neurons within the reward subsystem which encode reward prediction errors (RPE). These neurons exhibit high activation when the reward is higher than expected and low activation when the reward is lower than expected."}

A nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) is developed to track reference trajectories and handle contact constraints across locomotion modes, while a dedicated control allocation module exploits actuation redundancy to achieve energy-efficient control of actuators. Additionally, to enhance robustness during ground contact, we introduce an external wrench estimation algorithm that estimates environmental interaction forces and torques in real time. The system is validated through both simulation and real-world experiments, including seamless air-ground transitions and trajectory tracking.

By predicting collision possibility as a distribution, we extract both risk and uncertainty to guide the robot's actions. The uncertainty term encourages active perception, enabling simultaneous manipulation and information gathering to resolve occlusions. When combined with confidence maps that capture observation reliability, our approach enables safe navigation despite severe sensor occlusion. Extensive experiments across varying object sizes and obstacle configurations demonstrate that CURA-PPO achieves up to 3X higher success rates than the baselines, with learned behaviors that handle occlusions.

We present RULES, which encodes this specification via a two$-$section output and trains with reinforcement learning plus section$-$aware loss masking to assign penalty to the section responsible for errors. Training and evaluation draw on diverse natural language and formal proof corpora; robustness is assessed with a held$-$out perturbation suite; and end$-$to$-$end evaluation spans competition$-$style, perturbation$-$aligned, and theorem$-$based problems across various LLMs. Results show consistent in$-$domain gains over both a vanilla model and a single$-$label RL baseline, larger improvements on applicability$-$breaking perturbations, and parity or modest gains on end$-$to$-$end tasks; ablations indicate that the two$-$section outputs and section$-$aware reinforcement are both necessary for robustness."}

Such adaptation must preserve the global exploration benefits of pretraining while enabling rapid correction of local execution errors.We propose \\emph{Residual Flow Steering} (RFS), a data-efficient reinforcement learning framework for adapting pretrained generative policies.

We compare LLM-generated reasoning to human learner utterances under minimal and extended contextual prompting, and assess the models' ability to predict step-level learner success. Although GPT-4.1 generates fluent and contextually appropriate continuations, its reasoning is systematically over-coherent, verbose, and less variable than human think-alouds. These effects intensify with a richer problem-solving context during prompting. Learner performance was consistently overestimated.

Using onboard measurement data, we estimate and compensate for VIO drift through a novel mathematical drift model. State-of-the-art approaches often rely on more complex hardware (e.g., stereo cameras or rangefinders) and use uncorrected drifting VIO velocities, orientation, and angular rates, leading to errors during fast maneuvers. In contrast, our method corrects all VIO states (position, orientation, linear and angular velocity), resulting in accurate state estimation even during rapid and dynamic motion. Our approach was thoroughly validated through 1600 simulations and numerous real-world experiments.

This study examines how identical personality prompts lead to distinct linguistic, behavioral, and emotional outcomes across four conversational settings: ice-breaking, negotiation, group decision, and empathy tasks. Results show that contextual cues systematically influence both personality expression and emotional tone, suggesting that the same traits are expressed differently depending on social and affective demands. This raises an important question for LLM-based dialogue agents: whether such variations reflect inconsistency or context-sensitive adaptation akin to human behavior. Viewed through the lens of Whole Trait Theory, these findings highlight that LLMs exhibit context-sensitive rather than fixed personality expression, adapting flexibly to social interaction goals and affective conditions."}

While prior works showcased great performances, the widespread adoption of these models in robotics has been challenging as 1) existing methods are often closed-source or computationally intensive, neglecting the actual deployment on real-world physical systems, and 2) there is no universally accepted, plug-and-play representation for robotic task generation. Addressing these challenges, we propose BTGenBot-2, a 1B-parameter open-source small language model that directly converts natural language task descriptions and a list of robot action primitives into executable behavior trees in XML. Unlike prior approaches, BTGenBot-2 enables zero-shot BT generation, error recovery at inference and runtime, while remaining lightweight enough for resource-constrained robots. We further introduce the first standardized benchmark for LLM-based BT generation, covering 52 navigation and manipulation tasks in NVIDIA Isaac Sim. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that BTGenBot-2 consistently outperforms GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, and larger open-source models across both functional and non-functional metrics, achieving average success rates of 90.38% in zero-shot and 98.07% in one-shot, while delivering up to 16x faster inference compared to the previous BTGenBot."}

However, traditional distillation approaches face challenges related to knowledge conflicts and high resource demands, particularly when leveraging multiple teacher models. In this paper, we introduce the concept of \\textbf{Knowledge Purification}, which consolidates the rationales from multiple teacher LLMs into a single rationale, thereby mitigating conflicts and enhancing efficiency. To investigate the effectiveness of knowledge purification, we further propose five purification methods from various perspectives. Our experiments demonstrate that these methods not only improve the performance of the distilled model but also effectively alleviate knowledge conflicts. Moreover, router-based methods exhibit robust generalization capabilities, underscoring the potential of innovative purification techniques in optimizing multi-teacher distillation and facilitating the practical deployment of powerful yet lightweight models."}

Instead of enforcing a fixed reference at either the front or rear axle, the proposed method continuously interpolates between both, enabling smooth adaptation across driving contexts, including low-speed maneuvers and reverse motion. The lateral steering command is obtained by barycentric blending of two complementary controllers: a front-axle Stanley formulation and a rear-axle curvature-based geometric controller, yielding continuous transitions in steering behavior and improved tracking stability. In addition, we introduce a curvature-aware longitudinal control strategy based on virtual track borders and ray-tracing, which converts upcoming geometric constraints into a virtual obstacle distance and regulates speed accordingly. The complete approach is implemented in a unified control stack and validated in simulation and on a real autonomous vehicle equipped with GPS-RTK, radar, odometry, and IMU. The results in closed-loop tracking and backward maneuvers show improved trajectory accuracy, smoother steering profiles, and increased adaptability compared to fixed control-point baselines."}

In contrast, we propose a verifier-guided adaptive framework treating reasoning as iterative trajectory generation and selection. For each problem, the agent runs multiple inference iterations. In each iteration, it optionally produces a high-level plan, selects a set of reasoning tools and a compute strategy together with an exploration parameter, and then generates a candidate reasoning trajectory. A process reward model (PRM) serves as a unified control signal: within each iteration, step-level PRM scores are aggregated to guide pruning and expansion during generation, and across iterations, aggregated trajectory rewards are used to select the final response. Across datasets, our dynamic, PRM-guided approach consistently outperforms direct test-time scaling, yielding large gains on MATH-500 and several-fold improvements on harder benchmarks such as AIME24 and AMO-Bench. We characterize efficiency using theoretical FLOPs and a compute intensity metric penalizing wasted generation and tool overhead, demonstrating that verification-guided allocation concentrates computation on high-utility reasoning paths."}

Although recent frameworks such as RIFT have partially addressed these issues through group-relative optimization, their forward simulation procedures remain largely non-reactive, leading to unrealistic agent interactions within the virtual domain and ultimately limiting simulation fidelity. To address these issues, we propose ForSim, a stepwise closed-loop forward simulation paradigm. At each virtual timestep, the traffic agent propagates the virtual candidate trajectory that best spatiotemporally matches the reference trajectory through physically grounded motion dynamics, thereby preserving multimodal behavioral diversity while ensuring intra-modality consistency. Other agents are updated with stepwise predictions, yielding coherent and interaction-aware evolution. When incorporated into the RIFT traffic simulation framework, ForSim operates in conjunction with group-relative optimization to fine-tune traffic policy. Extensive experiments confirm that this integration consistently improves safety while maintaining efficiency, realism, and comfort. These results underscore the importance of modeling closed-loop multimodal interactions within forward simulation and enhance the fidelity and reliability of traffic simulation for autonomous driving.

While recent advances have extended TPPs to handle textual information, existing approaches are limited in their ability to generate rich, multimodal content and reason about event dynamics. A key challenge is that incorporating multimodal data dramatically increases sequence length, hindering the ability of attention-based models to generate coherent, long-form textual descriptions that require long-range understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that extends LLM-based TPPs to the visual modality, positioning text generation as a core capability alongside time and type prediction. Our approach addresses the long-context problem through an adaptive sequence compression mechanism based on temporal similarity, which reduces sequence length while preserving essential patterns. We employ a two-stage paradigm of pre-training on compressed sequences followed by supervised fine-tuning for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments, including on the challenging DanmakuTPP-QA benchmark, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy and the quality of its generated textual analyses."}

We reflect on the visual occlusion issue and identify its essence as the absence of information useful for task completion. Inspired by this, we come up with the more fundamental problem of Exploratory and Focused Manipulation (EFM). The proposed problem is about actively collecting information to complete challenging manipulation tasks that require exploration or focus. As an initial attempt to address this problem, we establish the EFM-10 benchmark that consists of 4 categories of tasks that align with our definition (10 tasks in total). We further come up with a Bimanual Active Perception (BAP) strategy, which leverages one arm to provide active vision and another arm to provide force sensing while manipulating. Based on this idea, we collect a dataset named BAPData for the tasks in EFM-10. With the dataset, we successfully verify the effectiveness of the BAP strategy in an imitation learning manner. We hope that the EFM-10 benchmark along with the BAP strategy can become a cornerstone that facilitates future research towards this direction. Project website: EFManipulation.github.io."}

Traditionally, position control is assigned to the macro manipulator, while the micro manipulator handles the interaction with the environment, limiting the achievable interaction control bandwidth. To solve this, we propose a novel control architecture that incorporates the macro manipulator into the active interaction control. This leads to a increase in control bandwidth by a factor of 2.1 compared to the state of the art architecture, based on the leader-follower approach and factor 12.5 compared to traditional robot-based force control. Further we propose surrogate models for a more efficient controller design and easy adaptation to hardware changes. We validate our approach by comparing it against the other control schemes in different experiments, like collision with an object, following a force trajectory and industrial assembly tasks."}

We adopt a dataset-centric view of cultural alignment and ask which linguistic properties of fine-tuning data are associated with cultural performance, whether these properties are predictive prior to training, and how these effects vary across models. We compute lightweight linguistic, semantic, and structural metrics for Arabic, Chinese, and Japanese datasets and apply principal component analysis separately within each language. This design ensures that the resulting components capture variation among datasets written in the same language rather than differences between languages. The resulting components correspond to broadly interpretable axes related to semantic coherence, surface-level lexical and syntactic diversity, and lexical or structural richness, though their composition varies across languages. We fine-tune three major LLM families (LLaMA, Mistral, DeepSeek) and evaluate them on benchmarks of cultural knowledge, values, and norms. While PCA components correlate with downstream performance, these associations are strongly model-dependent. Through controlled subset interventions, we show that lexical-oriented components (PC3) are the most robust, yielding more consistent performance across models and benchmarks, whereas emphasizing semantic or diversity extremes (PC1-PC2) is often neutral or harmful."}

During the collision detection phase, contact points are localized with particle-centric geometric primitives; during the contact resolution phase, we cast frictional contact as a Nonlinear Complementarity Problem (NCP) over contact impulses and solve it with an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) scheme. Crucially, the formulation reuses the same implicit MPM linearization, yielding efficiency and numerical stability. The method integrates seamlessly into the implicit MPM loop and is agnostic to modeling choices, including material laws, interpolation functions, and transfer schemes. We evaluate it across seven representative scenes that span elastic and elasto-plastic responses, simple and complex deformable geometries, and a wide range of contact conditions. Overall, the proposed method enables accurate contact localization, reliable frictional handling, and broad generality, making it a practical solution for MPM-based simulations in robotics and related domains."}

VWSD helps tackle lexical ambiguity in vision-language tasks. While conventional WSD depends only on text and lexical resources, VWSD uses visual cues to find the right meaning of ambiguous words with minimal text input. The review looks at developments from early multimodal fusion methods to new frameworks that use contrastive models like CLIP, diffusion-based text-to-image generation, and large language model (LLM) support. Studies from 2016 to 2025 are examined to show the growth of VWSD through feature-based, graph-based, and contrastive embedding techniques. It focuses on prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and adapting to multiple languages. Quantitative results show that CLIP-based fine-tuned models and LLM-enhanced VWSD systems consistently perform better than zero-shot baselines, achieving gains of up to 6-8\\% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). However, challenges still exist, such as limitations in context, model bias toward common meanings, a lack of multilingual datasets, and the need for better evaluation frameworks. The analysis highlights the growing overlap of CLIP alignment, diffusion generation, and LLM reasoning as the future path for strong, context-aware, and multilingual disambiguation systems."}

We present Force-Distilled VLA (FD-VLA), a novel framework that integrates force awareness into contact-rich manipulation without relying on physical force sensors. The core of our approach is a Force Distillation Module (FDM), which distills force by mapping a learnable query token, conditioned on visual observations and robot states, into a predicted force token aligned with the latent representation of actual force signals. During inference, this distilled force token is injected into the pretrained VLM, enabling force-aware reasoning while preserving the integrity of its vision-language semantics. This design provides two key benefits: first, it allows practical deployment across a wide range of robots that lack expensive or fragile force-torque sensors, thereby reducing hardware cost and complexity; second, the FDM introduces an additional force-vision-state fusion prior to the VLM, which improves cross-modal alignment and enhances perception-action robustness in contact-rich scenarios. Surprisingly, our physical experiments show that the distilled force token outperforms direct sensor force measurements as well as other baselines, which highlights the effectiveness of this force-distilled VLA approach."}

Several recent approaches aim to address this issue, including Sink Attention in GPT-OSS and Gated Attention in Qwen3-Next. However, a comprehensive analysis of the relationship among these attention mechanisms is lacking. In this work, we provide both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating that the sink in Vanilla Attention and Sink Attention naturally construct a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism within attention layers. This insight explains the head collapse phenomenon observed in prior work, where only a fixed subset of attention heads contributes to generation. To mitigate head collapse, we propose a sink-aware training algorithm with an auxiliary load balancing loss designed for attention layers. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves effective head load balancing and improves model performance across Vanilla Attention, Sink Attention, and Gated Attention. We hope this study offers a new perspective on attention mechanisms and encourages further exploration of the inherent MoE structure within attention layers."}

However, reducing amputee metabolic cost of walking remains an open problem. The Law of Intersegmental Coordination (ISC) has been observed across gaits and has been previously implicated in energy expenditure of walking, yet it has rarely been analyzed or applied within the context of lower-limb amputee gait. This law states that the elevation angles of the thigh, shank and foot over the gait cycle are not independent. In this work, we developed a method to analyze intersegmental coordination for lower-limb 3D kinematic data, to simplify ISC analysis. Moreover, inspired by motor control, biomechanics and robotics literature, we used our method to broaden ISC toward a new law of coordination of moments. We find these Elevation Space Moments (ESM), and present results showing a moment-based coordination for able bodied gait. We also analyzed ISC for amputee gait walking with powered and passive prosthesis, and found that while elevation angles remained planar, the ESM showed less coordination. We use ISC as a constraint to predict the shank angles/moments that would compensate for alterations due to a passive foot so as to mimic a healthy thigh angle/moment profile. This may have implications for improving powered prosthetic control. We developed the ISC3d toolbox that is freely available online, which may be used to compute kinematic and kinetic ISC in 3D. This provides a means to further study the role of coordination in gait and may help address fundamental questions of the neural control of human movement."}

However, scaling Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) via RL remains challenging due to interaction collapse: a pathological state where models fail to sustain multi-turn tool usage, instead degenerating into heavy internal reasoning with only trivial, post-hoc code verification. We systematically study three questions: (i) how cold-start SFT induces an agentic, tool-using behavioral prior, (ii) how the interaction density of cold-start trajectories shapes exploration and downstream RL outcomes, and (iii) how the RL interaction budget affects learning dynamics and generalization under varying inference-time budgets. We then introduce ASTER (Agentic Scaling with Tool-integrated Extended Reasoning), a framework that circumvents this collapse through a targeted cold-start strategy prioritizing interaction-dense trajectories. We find that a small expert cold-start set of just 4K interaction-dense trajectories yields the strongest downstream performance, establishing a robust prior that enables superior exploration during extended RL training. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ASTER-4B achieves state-of-the-art results on competitive mathematical benchmarks, reaching 90.0% on AIME 2025, surpassing leading frontier open-source models, including DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp."}

We further show that RTRRL synergizes with a recent biologically inspired recurrent network model, the Liquid-Resistance Liquid-Capacitance RNN.

Although general locomotion policies demonstrate capabilities across broad terrain distributions, they often struggle with arbitrary and highly challenging environments. To overcome this limitation, we propose a real-to-sim-to-real framework that leverages rapid test-time training (TTT) on novel terrains, significantly enhancing the robot's capability to traverse extremely difficult geometries. We adopt a two-stage end-to-end learning paradigm: a policy is first pre-trained on diverse procedurally generated terrains, followed by rapid fine-tuning on high-fidelity meshes reconstructed from real-world captures. Specifically, we develop a feed-forward, efficient, and high-fidelity geometry reconstruction pipeline using RGB-D inputs, ensuring both speed and quality during test-time training. We demonstrate that TTT-Parkour empowers humanoid robots to master complex obstacles, including wedges, stakes, boxes, trapezoids, and narrow beams. The whole pipeline of capturing, reconstructing, and test-time training requires less than 10 minutes on most tested terrains. Extensive experiments show that the policy after test-time training exhibits robust zero-shot sim-to-real transfer capability."}

However, some questions require inference, i.e., deriving answers that are not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the available information. We introduce Inferential QA -- a new task that challenges models to infer answers from answer-supporting passages which provide only clues. To study this problem, we construct QUIT (QUestions requiring Inference from Texts) dataset, comprising 7,401 questions and 2.4M passages built from high-convergence human- and machine-authored hints, labeled across three relevance levels using LLM-based answerability and human verification. Through comprehensive evaluation of retrievers, rerankers, and LLM-based readers, we show that methods effective on traditional QA tasks struggle in inferential QA: retrievers underperform, rerankers offer limited gains, and fine-tuning provides inconsistent improvements. Even reasoning-oriented LLMs fail to outperform smaller general-purpose models. These findings reveal that current QA pipelines are not yet ready for inference-based reasoning. Inferential QA thus establishes a new class of QA tasks that move towards understanding and reasoning from indirect textual evidence."}

To address this, we introduce PRISM, a single-pass policy based on a batch-global rejection-sampling variant of IMLE. PRISM couples a temporal multisensory encoder (integrating RGB, depth, tactile, audio, and proprioception) with a linear-attention generator using a Performer architecture. We demonstrate the efficacy of PRISM on a diverse real-world hardware suite, including loco-manipulation using a Unitree Go2 with a 7-DoF arm D1 and tabletop manipulation with a UR5 manipulator. Across challenging physical tasks such as pre-manipulation parking, high-precision insertion, and multi-object pick-and-place, PRISM outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion policies by 10-25% in success rate while maintaining high-frequency (30-50 Hz) closed-loop control. We further validate our approach on large-scale simulation benchmarks, including CALVIN, MetaWorld, and Robomimic. In CALVIN (10% data split), PRISM improves success rates by approximately 25% over diffusion and approximately 20% over flow matching, while simultaneously reducing trajectory jerk by 20x-50x.

Prior studies largely address monotone instances, whereas real-world tasks are often non-monotone-objects block one another and must be temporarily relocated to intermediate positions before reaching their final goals. In such settings, effective multi-agent collaboration can substantially reduce the time required to complete tasks. This paper introduces Centralized, Asynchronous, Multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (CAM-MCTS), a novel framework for general-purpose makespan-efficient object rearrangement planning in challenging environments. CAM-MCTS combines centralized task assignment-where agents remain aware of each other's intended actions to facilitate globally optimized planning-with an asynchronous task execution strategy that enables agents to take on new tasks at appropriate time steps, rather than waiting for others, guided by a one-step look-ahead cost estimate. This design minimizes idle time, prevents unnecessary synchronization delays, and enhances overall system efficiency. We evaluate CAM-MCTS across a diverse set of monotone and non-monotone tasks in cluttered environments, demonstrating consistent reductions in makespan compared to strong baselines. Finally, we validate our approach on a real-world multi-agent system under different configurations, further confirming its effectiveness and robustness."}

This variation suggests that using a fixed draft length limits the potential for further improvements in decoding speed. To address this challenge, we propose Pacer, a novel approach that dynamically controls draft length using a lightweight, trainable pre-verification layer. This layer pre-verifies draft tokens blockwise before they are sent to the target model, allowing the draft model to stop token generation if the blockwise pre-verification fails. We implement Pacer on multiple SD model pairs and evaluate its performance across various benchmarks.

Our contributions include: (1) integrating 3D foundation models to reliably estimate relative poses from monocular image pairs within decentralized C-SLAM; (2) introducing robust outlier mitigation techniques critical to the use of these relative poses; and (3) developing specialized pose graph optimization formulations that efficiently resolve scale ambiguities. We evaluate our method against state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating improvements in localization and mapping accuracy, alongside significant gains in computational and memory efficiency. These results highlight the potential of our approach for deployment in large-scale multi-robot scenarios."}

With the recent emergence of world models learned from real-world video-action data, we ask the question of whether training a policy in a world model can be more effective than supervised learning or software simulation in achieving better real-robot performance. We propose World-Gymnast, which performs RL finetuning of a vision-language-action (VLA) policy by rolling out the policy in an action-conditioned video world model and rewarding the rollouts with a vision-language model (VLM). On the Bridge robot setup, World-Gymnast outperforms SFT by as much as 18x and outperforms software simulator by as much as 2x. More importantly, World-Gymnast demonstrates intriguing capabilities of RL with a world model, including training on diverse language instructions and novel scenes from the world model, test-time training in a novel scene, and online iterative world model and policy improvement.

However, their practical utility is blocked by a critical limitation: the requirement of a fixed-length masked sequence for generation. This constraint severely degrades code infilling performance when the predefined mask size mismatches the ideal completion length. To address this, we propose DreamOn, a novel diffusion framework that enables dynamic, variable-length generation. DreamOn augments the diffusion process with two length control states, allowing the model to autonomously expand or contract the output length based solely on its own predictions. We integrate this mechanism into existing DLMs with minimal modifications to the training objective and no architectural changes. Built upon Dream-Coder-7B and DiffuCoder-7B, DreamOn achieves infilling performance on par with state-of-the-art autoregressive models on HumanEval-Infilling and SantaCoder-FIM and matches oracle performance achieved with ground-truth length.

Recent work mainly focused on improving answer accuracy via fine-tuning and structured or reinforcement-based optimization. However, reliable reasoning in response generation faces three challenges: 1) Reasoning Collapse. Reasoning in multi-hop QA is inherently complex due to multi-hop composition and is further destabilized by noisy retrieval. 2) Reasoning-answer inconsistency. Due to the intrinsic uncertainty of LLM generation and exposure to evidence--distractor mixtures, models may produce correct answers that are not faithfully supported by their intermediate reasoning or evidence. 3) Loss of format control. Traditional chain-of-thought generation often deviates from required structured output formats, leading to incomplete or malformed structured content. To address these challenges, we propose CRAFT (Calibrated Reasoning with Answer-Faithful Traces), a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement learning framework that trains models to perform faithful reasoning during response generation. CRAFT employs dual reward mechanisms to optimize multi-hop reasoning: deterministic rewards ensure structural correctness while judge-based rewards verify semantic faithfulness. This optimization framework supports controllable trace variants that enable systematic analysis of how structure and scale affect reasoning performance and faithfulness. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks show that CRAFT improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness across model scales, with the CRAFT 7B model achieving competitive performance with closed-source LLMs across multiple reasoning trace settings."}

XDLM offers two key contributions: (1) it provides a principled theoretical unification of MDLM and UDLM, recovering each paradigm as a special case; and (2) an alleviated memory bottleneck enabled by an algebraic simplification of the posterior probabilities.

HumanX integrates two co-designed components: XGen, a data generation pipeline that synthesizes diverse and physically plausible robot interaction data from video while supporting scalable data augmentation; and XMimic, a unified imitation learning framework that learns generalizable interaction skills.

Among various approaches, Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) has become a particularly important framework, enabling iterative generation, evaluation, rejection, and resampling of intermediate reasoning trajectories. A central component in this process is the reward model, which evaluates partial solutions and guides the allocation of computation during inference.\n  However, in practice, true reward models are never available. All deployed systems rely on approximate reward models, raising a fundamental question: Why and when do approximate reward models suffice for effective inference-time scaling? In this work, we provide a theoretical answer. We identify the Bellman error of the approximate reward model as the key quantity governing the effectiveness of SMC-based inference-time scaling. For a reasoning process of length $T$, we show that if the Bellman error of the approximate reward model is bounded by $O(1/T)$, then combining this reward model with SMC reduces the computational complexity of reasoning from exponential in $T$ to polynomial in $T$. This yields an exponential improvement in inference efficiency despite using only approximate rewards."}

In this work, we revisit where and how to distill in autoregressive LLMs. We disentangle selective KD along the position, class, and sample axes and systematically compare importance signals and selection policies. Then, guided by this analysis, we identify underexplored opportunities and introduce student-entropy-guided position selection (SE-KD). Across a suite of benchmarks, SE-KD often improves accuracy, downstream task adherence, and memory efficiency over dense distillation. Extending this approach across the class and sample axes (SE-KD 3X) yields complementary efficiency gains that make offline teacher caching feasible.

HLS offers faster iteration cycles, portability, and design permutability that make it a natural layer for agentic optimization.This position paper makes three contributions.

In addition, we propose fine-tuned pipelines for encoder-decoder language-specific and multilingual baseline models, and prompting-based pipelines for decoder-only LLMs to disentangle parametric and contextual knowledge in both factual and counterfactual scenarios. Furthermore, we apply LLM-based and human evaluation techniques that measure answer quality based on semantic similarity.

Building on this observation, we propose ConPress (Learning from Contextual Pressure), a lightweight self-supervised fine-tuning approach.

This study proposes Argument Rarity-based Originality Assessment (AROA), a framework for automatically evaluating argumentative originality in student essays. AROA defines originality as rarity within a reference corpus and evaluates it through four complementary components: structural rarity, claim rarity, evidence rarity, and cognitive depth. The framework quantifies the rarity of each component using density estimation and integrates them with a quality adjustment mechanism, thereby treating quality and originality as independent evaluation axes. Experiments using human essays and AI-generated essays revealed a strong negative correlation between quality and claim rarity, demonstrating a quality-originality trade-off where higher-quality texts tend to rely on typical claim patterns. Furthermore, while AI essays achieved comparable levels of structural complexity to human essays, their claim rarity was substantially lower than that of humans, indicating that LLMs can reproduce the form of argumentation but have limitations in the originality of content."}

This paper introduces a novel perspective, demonstrating that attention value vectors capture sentence semantics more effectively than hidden states. We propose Value Aggregation (VA), a simple method that pools token values across multiple layers and token indices. In a training-free setting, VA outperforms other LLM-based embeddings, even matches or surpasses the ensemble-based MetaEOL. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when paired with suitable prompts, the layer attention outputs can be interpreted as aligned weighted value vectors. Specifically, the attention scores of the last token function as the weights, while the output projection matrix ($W_O$) aligns these weighted value vectors with the common space of the LLM residual stream. This refined method, termed Aligned Weighted VA (AlignedWVA), achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free LLM-based embeddings, outperforming the high-cost MetaEOL by a substantial margin. Finally, we highlight the potential of obtaining strong LLM embedding models through fine-tuning Value Aggregation."}

Yet SVs can be unreliable in practice. Some concepts are unsteerable, and even when steering helps on average it can backfire for a non-trivial fraction of inputs. Reliability also degrades in long-form generation and multi-attribute steering. We take a geometric view of these failures. A static SV applies the same update vector everywhere in representation space, implicitly assuming that the concept-improving direction is constant across contexts. When the locally effective direction varies with the current activation, a single global vector can become misaligned, which yields weak or reversed effects. Guided by this perspective, we propose Steering Vector Fields (SVF), which learns a differentiable concept scoring function whose local gradient defines the steering direction at each activation, making interventions explicitly context-dependent. This formulation supports coordinated multi-layer interventions in a shared, aligned concept space, and enables efficient long-form and multi-attribute control within a unified framework. Across multiple LLMs and steering tasks, SVF delivers stronger and more reliable control, improving the practicality of inference-time steering."}

In this paper, we propose CoDiQ (Controllable Difficult Question Generation), a novel framework enabling fine-grained difficulty control via test-time scaling while ensuring question solvability. Specifically, first, we identify a test-time scaling tendency (extended reasoning token budget boosts difficulty but reduces solvability) and the intrinsic properties defining the upper bound of a model's ability to generate valid, high-difficulty questions. Then, we develop CoDiQ-Generator from Qwen3-8B, which improves the upper bound of difficult question generation, making it particularly well-suited for challenging question construction. Building on the CoDiQ framework, we build CoDiQ-Corpus (44K competition-grade question sequences). Human evaluations show these questions are significantly more challenging than LiveCodeBench/AIME with over 82% solvability. Training LRMs on CoDiQ-Corpus substantially improves reasoning performance, verifying that scaling controlled-difficulty training questions enhances reasoning capabilities.

Building on this utility, we introduce retrieval continuation and granularity control mechanisms that selectively regulate when to continue and stop retrieval, and how much information to expand. An annealed control strategy enables the agent to internalize effective information acquisition behaviors during training.

ICL opens up new ways to utilize LLMs in more domains, but its underlying mechanisms still remain poorly understood, making error correction and diagnosis extremely challenging. Thus, it is imperative that we better understand the limitations of ICL and how exactly LLMs support ICL.

We hypothesize that effective steering corresponds to structured entropy preservation and coherent KL alignment across decoding steps. Building on a reliability study demonstrating high inter-judge agreement between two architecturally distinct LLMs, we use LLM-generated annotations as ground truth and show that these mechanistic signals provide meaningful predictive power for identifying successful steering and estimating failure probability.

We introduce Marginal Information Gain (MIG), a metric defined as the relevance of a unit to the input query minus its semantic redundancy with other units, guiding the compression process to prioritize information that is both relevant and low redundant. The framework operates in two stages: (1) Coarse-Grained Group Reallocation, where the context is partitioned into groups and dynamically assigned compression rates based on inter-group MIG, ensuring compression budgets align with information value distribution; and (2) Fine-Grained Token Merging, where tokens within each group are fused via an intra-group MIG-based weighting mechanism, thereby preserving key semantics while avoiding the accumulation of redundancy.

Most existing guardrails for CUAs adopt a reactive approach, constraining agent behavior only within the current observation space. While these guardrails can prevent immediate short-term risks (e.g., clicking on a phishing link), they cannot proactively avoid long-term risks: seemingly reasonable actions can lead to high-risk consequences that emerge with a delay (e.g., cleaning logs leads to future audits being untraceable), which reactive guardrails cannot identify within the current observation space. To address these limitations, we propose a predictive guardrail approach, with the core idea of aligning predicted future risks with current decisions. Based on this approach, we present SafePred, a predictive guardrail framework for CUAs that establishes a risk-to-decision loop to ensure safe agent behavior. SafePred supports two key abilities: (1) Short- and long-term risk prediction: by using safety policies as the basis for risk prediction, SafePred leverages the prediction capability of the world model to generate semantic representations of both short-term and long-term risks, thereby identifying and pruning actions that lead to high-risk states; (2) Decision optimization: translating predicted risks into actionable safe decision guidances through step-level interventions and task-level re-planning. Extensive experiments show that SafePred significantly reduces high-risk behaviors, achieving over 97.6% safety performance and improving task utility by up to 21.4% compared with reactive baselines."}

First, we introduce a Two-Stage fine-tuning strategy that leverages low-rank adaptations to better adapt an AES model to target prompt essays. Second, we introduce a Score Alignment technique to improve consistency between predicted and true score distributions. Third, we employ uncertainty-aware self-training using unlabeled data, effectively expanding the training set with pseudo-labeled samples while mitigating label noise propagation. We implement above three key techniques on DualBERT. We conduct extensive experiments on the ASAP++ dataset.

In this paper, we propose WorldCup, a multi-bit watermarking framework for LLMs that treats sampling as a natural communication channel and embeds message bits directly into token selection via a hierarchical competition mechanism guided by complementary signals. Moreover, WorldCup further adopts entropy-aware modulation to preserve generation quality and supports robust message recovery through confidence-aware decoding. Comprehensive experiments show that WorldCup achieves a strong balance across capacity, detectability, robustness, text quality, and decoding efficiency, consistently outperforming prior baselines and laying a solid foundation for future LLM watermarking studies."}

Unlike methods relying on static datasets, Zero2Text synergizes LLM priors with a dynamic ridge regression mechanism to iteratively align generation to the target embedding on-the-fly. We further demonstrate that standard defenses, such as differential privacy, fail to effectively mitigate this adaptive threat. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks validate Zero2Text; notably, on MS MARCO against the OpenAI victim model, it achieves 1.8x higher ROUGE-L and 6.4x higher BLEU-2 scores compared to baselines, recovering sentences from unknown domains without a single leaked data pair."}

Existing approaches mainly either verbalize graphs into natural language, which leads to excessive token consumption and scattered attention, or transform graphs into trainable continuous embeddings (i.e., soft prompt), but exhibit severe misalignment with original text tokens. To solve this problem, we propose to incorporate one special token <SOG_k> to fully represent the Structure Of Graph within a unified token space, facilitating explicit topology input and structural information sharing. Specifically, we propose a topology-aware structural tokenizer that maps each graph topology into a highly selective single token. Afterwards, we construct a set of hybrid structure Question-Answering corpora to align new structural tokens with existing text tokens. With this approach, <SOG_k> empowers LLMs to understand, generate, and reason in a concise and accurate manner. Extensive experiments on five graph-level benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving a performance improvement of 9.9% to 41.4% compared to the baselines while exhibiting interpretability and consistency. Furthermore, our method provides a flexible extension to node-level tasks, enabling both global and local structural understanding.

Although recent advancements have widely adopted context compression to address these challenges, existing research only focus on model-side improvements, the impact of the data distribution itself on context compression remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we are the first to adopt a data-centric perspective to systematically investigate how data distribution impacts compression quality, including two dimensions: input data and intrinsic data (i.e., the model's internal pretrained knowledge). We evaluate the semantic integrity of compressed representations using an autoencoder-based framework to systematically investigate it. Our experimental results reveal that: (1) encoder-measured input entropy negatively correlates with compression quality, while decoder-measured entropy shows no significant relationship under a frozen-decoder setting; and (2) the gap between intrinsic data of the encoder and decoder significantly diminishes compression gains, which is hard to mitigate. Based on these findings, we further present practical guidelines to optimize compression gains."}

Currently, these models rely on a text-based paradigm that treats source code as a linear sequence of tokens, which leads to a linear increase in context length and associated computational costs. The rapid advancement of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) introduces an opportunity to optimize efficiency by representing source code as rendered images. Unlike text, which is difficult to compress without losing semantic meaning, the image modality is inherently suitable for compression. By adjusting resolution, images can be scaled to a fraction of their original token cost while remaining recognizable to vision-capable models. To explore the feasibility of this approach, we conduct the first systematic study on the effectiveness of MLLMs for code understanding. Our experiments reveal that: (1) MLLMs can effectively understand code with substantial token reduction, achieving up to 8x compression; (2) MLLMs can effectively leverage visual cues such as syntax highlighting, improving code completion performance under 4x compression; and (3) Code-understanding tasks like clone detection exhibit exceptional resilience to visual compression, with some compression ratios even slightly outperforming raw text inputs. Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of MLLMs in code understanding, which points out a shift toward image-modality code representation as a pathway to more efficient inference."}

We argue that such static embedding of the target word is insensitive to neighboring words, encouraging locally accurate word prediction while neglecting global structure across the target sentence. To address this limitation, we propose a continuous sentence representation, termed sentence curve, defined as a spline curve whose control points affect multiple words in the sentence. Based on this representation, we introduce sentence curve language model (SCLM), which extends DLMs to predict sentence curves instead of the static word embeddings. We theoretically show that sentence curve prediction induces a regularization effect that promotes global structure modeling, and characterize how different sentence curve types affect this behavior. Empirically, SCLM achieves SOTA performance among DLMs on IWSLT14 and WMT14, shows stable training without burdensome knowledge distillation, and demonstrates promising potential compared to discrete DLMs on LM1B."}

Inspired by human reading behavior (i.e., close reading important content while skimming less relevant content), RAM partitions the context into segments and encodes them with the input query in parallel. High-relevance segments are fully retained (close reading), while low-relevance ones are query-guided compressed into compact summary vectors (skimming). Both explicit textual segments and implicit summary vectors are concatenated and fed into decoder to achieve both superior performance and natural language format interpretability. To refine the decision boundary between close reading and skimming, we further introduce a contrastive learning objective based on positive and negative query-segment pairs.

Recent approaches, such as teaching models to say \"I don't know\" or post-hoc knowledge editing, either evade the problem or face catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue from its root, we propose \\textbf{PretrainRL}, a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning into the pretraining phase to consolidate factual knowledge. The core principle of PretrainRL is \"\\textbf{debiasing then learning}.\" It actively reshapes the model's probability distribution by down-weighting high-probability falsehoods, thereby making \"room\" for low-probability truths to be learned effectively. To enable this, we design an efficient negative sampling strategy to discover these high-probability falsehoods and introduce novel metrics to evaluate the model's probabilistic state concerning factual knowledge.

To address this gap, we introduce ES-MemEval, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates five core memory capabilities: information extraction, temporal reasoning, conflict detection, abstention, and user modeling, in long-term emotional support settings, covering question answering, summarization, and dialogue generation tasks. To support the benchmark, we also propose EvoEmo, a multi-session dataset for personalized long-term emotional support that captures fragmented, implicit user disclosures and evolving user states. Extensive experiments on open-source long-context, commercial, and retrieval-augmented (RAG) LLMs show that explicit long-term memory is essential for reducing hallucinations and enabling effective personalization.

Analysis of end-of-course feedback from 19 students reveals high satisfaction (mean scores 4.4-4.6/5.0) across engagement, conceptual learning, and assessment fairness.

However, these methods suffer from a \"Static Graph Fallacy\": they rely on fixed transition probabilities determined during indexing. This rigidity ignores the query-dependent nature of edge relevance, causing semantic drift where random walks are diverted into high-degree \"hub\" nodes before reaching critical downstream evidence. Consequently, models often achieve high partial recall but fail to retrieve the complete evidence chain required for multi-hop queries. To address this, we propose CatRAG, Context-Aware Traversal for robust RAG, a framework that builds on the HippoRAG 2 architecture and transforms the static KG into a query-adaptive navigation structure. We introduce a multi-faceted framework to steer the random walk: (1) Symbolic Anchoring, which injects weak entity constraints to regularize the random walk; (2) Query-Aware Dynamic Edge Weighting, which dynamically modulates graph structure, to prune irrelevant paths while amplifying those aligned with the query's intent; and (3) Key-Fact Passage Weight Enhancement, a cost-efficient bias that structurally anchors the random walk to likely evidence. Experiments across four multi-hop benchmarks demonstrate that CatRAG consistently outperforms state of the art baselines. Our analysis reveals that while standard Recall metrics show modest gains, CatRAG achieves substantial improvements in reasoning completeness, the capacity to recover the entire evidence path without gaps. These results reveal that our approach effectively bridges the gap between retrieving partial context and enabling fully grounded reasoning.

We introduce Moe-Ctc, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture with intermediate CTC supervision that jointly promotes expert specialization and generalization. During training, accent-aware routing encourages experts to capture accent-specific patterns, which gradually transitions to label-free routing for inference. Each expert is equipped with its own CTC head to align routing with transcription quality, and a routing-augmented loss further stabilizes optimization. Experiments on the Mcv-Accent benchmark demonstrate consistent gains across both seen and unseen accents in low- and high-resource conditions, achieving up to 29.3% relative WER reduction over strong FastConformer baselines."}

To address this issue, we propose an Orthogonal Hierarchical Decomposition (OHD) framework that constructs structure-preserving input representations of complex tables for LLMs. OHD introduces an Orthogonal Tree Induction (OTI) method based on spatial--semantic co-constraints, which decomposes irregular tables into a column tree and a row tree to capture vertical and horizontal hierarchical dependencies, respectively. Building on this representation, we design a dual-pathway association protocol to symmetrically reconstruct semantic lineage of each cell, and incorporate an LLM as a semantic arbitrator to align multi-level semantic information. We evaluate OHD framework on two complex table question answering benchmarks, AITQA and HiTab.

To explore this, our study presents a self-sampling framework based on activation steering for efficient CoT learning.

We argue retrieval should move beyond similarity matching and instead operate over latent components, following decoupling to aggregation: disentangle memories into semantic components, organise them into a hierarchy, and use this structure to drive retrieval. We propose xMemory, which builds a hierarchy of intact units and maintains a searchable yet faithful high-level node organisation via a sparsity--semantics objective that guides memory split and merge. At inference, xMemory retrieves top-down, selecting a compact, diverse set of themes and semantics for multi-fact queries, and expanding to episodes and raw messages only when it reduces the reader's uncertainty.

RPG-Encoder closes the reasoning loop through three mechanisms: (1) Encoding raw code into the RPG that combines lifted semantic features with code dependencies; (2) Evolving the topology incrementally to decouple maintenance costs from repository scale, reducing overhead by 95.7%; and (3) Operating as a unified interface for structure-aware navigation. In evaluations, RPG-Encoder establishes state-of-the-art repository understanding on SWE-bench Verified with 93.7% Acc@5 and exceeds the best baseline by over 10% on SWE-bench Live Lite. These results highlight our superior fine-grained localization accuracy in complex codebases. Furthermore, it achieves 98.5% reconstruction coverage on RepoCraft, confirming RPG's high-fidelity capacity to mirror the original codebase and closing the loop between intent and implementation."}

We present LEC-KG, a bidirectional collaborative framework that integrates the semantic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the structural reasoning of Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE). Our approach features three key components: (1) hierarchical coarse-to-fine relation extraction that mitigates long-tail bias, (2) evidence-guided Chain-of-Thought feedback that grounds structural suggestions in source text, and (3) semantic initialization that enables structural validation for unseen entities. The two modules enhance each other iteratively-KGE provides structure-aware feedback to refine LLM extractions, while validated triples progressively improve KGE representations. We evaluate LEC-KG on Chinese Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) reports, demonstrating substantial improvements over LLM baselines, particularly on low-frequency relations. Through iterative refinement, our framework reliably transforms unstructured policy text into validated knowledge graph triples."}

Moreover, naive length penalties in group-relative optimization can severely hurt accuracy. We attribute this failure to two structural issues: (i) Dilution of Length Baseline, where incorrect responses (with zero length reward) depress the group baseline and over-penalize correct solutions; and (ii) Difficulty-Penalty Mismatch, where a static penalty cannot adapt to problem difficulty, suppressing necessary reasoning on hard instances while leaving redundancy on easy ones. We propose Dynamic Decoupled Conditional Advantage (DDCA) to decouple efficiency optimization from correctness. DDCA computes length advantages conditionally within the correct-response cluster to eliminate baseline dilution, and dynamically scales the penalty strength using the group pass rate as a proxy for difficulty. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, AMC23, and AIME25 show that DDCA consistently improves the efficiency--accuracy trade-off relative to adaptive baselines, reducing generated tokens by approximately 60% on simpler tasks (e.g., GSM8K) versus over 20% on harder benchmarks (e.g., AIME25), thereby maintaining or improving accuracy.

The model is released in three sizes: 24B - adapted from the Mistral-Small-3.1 base model, 12B - adapted from the NVIDIA Nemotron Nano V2 model, and 1.7B - adapted from the Qwen3-1.7B base model. We are releasing multiple variants of each model, each with a native context length of 65k tokens; base model and chat model with tool-calling support. To rigorously evaluate our models, we introduce a new benchmark suite for evaluation of Hebrew chat-LLMs, covering a diverse set of tasks including Translation, Summarization, Winograd, Israeli Trivia, and Diacritization (nikud).

The primary culprits are the activations, whose memory footprints scale linearly with sequence length. We introduce OOMB, a highly memory-efficient training system that directly confronts this barrier. Our approach employs a chunk-recurrent training framework with on-the-fly activation recomputation, which maintains a constant activation memory footprint (O(1)) and shifts the primary bottleneck to the growing KV cache. To manage the KV cache, OOMB integrates a suite of synergistic optimizations: a paged memory manager for both the KV cache and its gradients to eliminate fragmentation, asynchronous CPU offloading to hide data transfer latency, and page-level sparse attention to reduce both computational complexity and communication overhead. The synergy of these techniques yields exceptional efficiency. Our empirical results show that for every additional 10K tokens of context, the end-to-end training memory overhead increases by a mere 10MB for Qwen2.5-7B. This allows training Qwen2.5-7B with a 4M-token context on a single H200 GPU, a feat that would otherwise require a large cluster using context parallelism. This work represents a substantial advance in resource efficiency for long-context LLM training. The source code is available at https://github.com/wenhaoli-xmu/OOMB."}

We show that this account is incomplete. Across eleven categories of refusal and non-compliance, including safety, incomplete or unsupported requests, anthropomorphization, and over-refusal, we find that these refusal behaviors correspond to geometrically distinct directions in activation space. Yet despite this diversity, linear steering along any refusal-related direction produces nearly identical refusal to over-refusal trade-offs, acting as a shared one-dimensional control knob. The primary effect of different directions is not whether the model refuses, but how it refuses."}

To investigate this question, we introduce GapEval, a bidirectional benchmark designed to quantify the gap between understanding and generation capabilities, and quantitatively measure the cognitive coherence of the two \"unified\" directions. Each question can be answered in both modalities (image and text), enabling a symmetric evaluation of a model's bidirectional inference capability and cross-modal consistency. Experiments reveal a persistent gap between the two directions across a wide range of UMMs with different architectures, suggesting that current models achieve only surface-level unification rather than deep cognitive convergence of the two. To further explore the underlying mechanism, we conduct an empirical study from the perspective of knowledge manipulation to illustrate the underlying limitations. Our findings indicate that knowledge within UMMs often remains disjoint. The capability emergence and knowledge across modalities are unsynchronized, paving the way for further exploration."}

In this paper, we present Focus-dLLM, a novel training-free attention sparsification framework tailored for accurate and efficient long-context dLLM inference. Based on the finding that token confidence strongly correlates across adjacent steps, we first design a past confidence-guided indicator to predict unmasked regions.

To further reduce overhead, this strategy reuses identified sink locations across layers, leveraging the observed cross-layer consistency.

Existing linguistic benchmarks typically focus on narrow phenomena, emphasize high-resource languages, and rarely evaluate metalinguistic knowledge-explicit reasoning about language structure rather than language use. Using accuracy and macro F1, together with majority-class and chance baselines, we analyse overall performance and examine variation by linguistic domains and language-related factors. Our results show that metalinguistic knowledge in current LLMs is limited: GPT-4o performs best but achieves only moderate accuracy (0.367), while open-source models lag behind. All models perform above chance but fail to outperform the majority-class baseline, suggesting they capture cross-linguistic patterns but lack fine-grained grammatical distinctions. Performance varies across linguistic domains, with lexical features showing the highest accuracy and phonological features among the lowest, partially reflecting differences in online visibility. At the language level, accuracy shows a strong association with digital language status: languages with higher digital presence and resource availability are evaluated more accurately, while low-resource languages show substantially lower performance. Analyses of predictive factors confirm that resource-related indicators (Wikipedia size, corpus availability) are more informative predictors of accuracy than geographical, genealogical, or sociolinguistic factors. Together, these results suggest that LLMs' metalinguistic knowledge is fragmented and shaped by data availability rather than generalizable grammatical competence across the world's languages. We release our benchmark as an open-source dataset to support systematic evaluation and encourage greater global linguistic diversity in future LLMs."}

While prior works mainly focus on point-wise and pair-wise evaluation paradigms. Rubric-based evaluation, where LLMs select a score from multiple rubrics, has received less analysis. In this work, we show that rubric-based evaluation implicitly resembles a multi-choice setting and therefore has position bias: LLMs prefer score options appearing at specific positions in the rubric list. Through controlled experiments across multiple models and datasets, we demonstrate consistent position bias. To mitigate this bias, we propose a balanced permutation strategy that evenly distributes each score option across positions. We show that aggregating scores across balanced permutations not only reveals latent position bias, but also improves correlation between the LLM-as-a-Judge and human. Our results suggest that rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge is not inherently point-wise and that simple permutation-based calibration can substantially improve its reliability."}

Despite the heuristic focus on regularity, it is often more an intuitive judgement than a quantified evaluation, and irregularity is more common than expected from the Neogrammarian model. Given the recent progress of computational methods in historical linguistics and the increased availability of standardized lexical data, we are now able to improve our workflows and provide such a quantitative evaluation. Here, we present the balanced average recurrence of correspondence patterns as a new measure of regularity. We also present a new computational method that uses this measure to identify cognate sets that lack regularity with respect to their correspondence patterns. We validate the method through two experiments, using simulated and real data. In the experiments, we employ leave-one-out validation to measure the regularity of cognate sets in which one word form has been replaced by an irregular one, checking how well our method identifies the forms causing the irregularity. Our method achieves an overall accuracy of 85\\% with the datasets based on real data. We also show the benefits of working with subsamples of large datasets and how increasing irregularity in the data influences our results.

We investigate evaluation reliability by holding generation conditions constant while varying target language. Using synthetic customer-support dialogues generated with identical parameters across Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian, we test whether automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge scoring produce stable model rankings across these morphologically rich, related Finno-Ugric languages. With a small set of Estonian native speaker annotations as a reference point, we find systematic ranking instabilities: surface-level metrics (lexical diversity, surface and semantic similarity) maintain cross-language stability, but pragmatic judgments (coherence, instruction-following) exhibit rank inversions and near-zero correlations. Because generation is controlled, these inconsistencies reflect how judge scoring behaves differently across languages rather than true model differences.\n  This controlled design provides a diagnostic probe: evaluation methods that fail to maintain stability under identical generation conditions signal transfer failure before deployment. Our findings suggest that zero-shot judge transfer is unreliable for discourse-level assessment in morphologically rich languages, motivating language-specific calibration against targeted human baselines.

StoryScore integrates semantic alignment, lexical grounding, narrative control, structural fidelity, redundancy avoidance, and entity-level hallucination detection into a unified framework. Our analysis also reveals why many hallucination detection methods fail to distinguish pedagogical creativity from factual errors, highlighting a key limitation: while automatic metrics can effectively assess semantic similarity with original content, they struggle to evaluate how it is narrated and controlled."}

We find representations of curved \"belief manifolds\" for these parameters form with sufficient in-context learning and study how the model adapts when the distribution suddenly changes. While standard linear steering often pushes the model off-manifold and induces coupled, out-of-distribution shifts, geometry and field-aware steering better preserves the intended belief family. Our work demonstrates an example of linear field probing (LFP) as a simple approach to tile the data manifold and make interventions that respect the underlying geometry. We conclude that rich structure emerges naturally in LLMs and that purely linear concept representations are often an inadequate abstraction."}

Accurately aligning molecular structure with natural language is therefore essential for enabling large language models (LLMs) to reason about downstream chemical tasks.

In this work, we propose a fully automated annotation framework for generating precise molecular structure descriptions at scale. Our approach builds upon and extends a rule-based chemical nomenclature parser to interpret IUPAC names and construct enriched, structured XML metadata that explicitly encodes molecular structure. This metadata is then used to guide LLMs in producing accurate natural-language descriptions. Using this framework, we curate a large-scale dataset of approximately $163$k molecule-description pairs. A rigorous validation protocol combining LLM-based and expert human evaluation on a subset of $2,000$ molecules demonstrates a high description precision of $98.6\\%$. The resulting dataset provides a reliable foundation for future molecule-language alignment, and the proposed annotation method is readily extensible to larger datasets and broader chemical tasks that rely on structural descriptions."}

This disparity is particularly evident in in-context learning scenarios, where providing demonstrations in English but testing on non-English inputs leads to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we hypothesize that LLMs develop a universal semantic space for understanding languages, where different languages are encoded as distinct directions within this space. Based on this hypothesis, we propose language vectors -- a training-free language steering approach that leverages activation differences between source and target languages to guide model behavior. We steer the model generations by adding the vector to the intermediate model activations during inference. This is done to make the model's internal representations shift towards the target language space without any parameter updates. We evaluate our method across three datasets and test on a total of 19 languages on three different models. Our results show consistent improvements on multilingual in-context learning over baselines across all tasks and languages tested. Beyond performance gains, hierarchical clustering of steering vectors reveals meaningful linguistic structure aligned with language families. These vectors also successfully transfer across tasks, demonstrating that these representations are task-agnostic."}

Building on this view, we propose a unified preference-utility analysis that separates control effects into preference, defined as the tendency toward a target concept, and utility, defined as coherent and task-valid generation, and measures both on a shared log-odds scale using polarity-paired contrastive examples. Across methods, we observe a consistent trade-off between preference and utility: stronger control increases preference while predictably reducing utility. We further explain this behavior through an activation manifold perspective, in which control shifts representations along target-concept directions to enhance preference, while utility declines primarily when interventions push representations off the model's valid-generation manifold. Finally, we introduce a new steering approach SPLIT guided by this analysis that improves preference while better preserving utility.

Low-friction assistants can become sycophantic, baking in implicit assumptions and pushing verification costs onto experts, while outcomes arrive too late to serve as reward signals. In deep-uncertainty decisions (where objectives are contested and reversals are costly), scaling fluent agreement amplifies poor commitments faster than it builds expertise. We argue reliable human-AI partnership requires a shift from answer generation to collaborative premise governance over a knowledge substrate, negotiating only what is decision-critical. A discrepancy-driven control loop operates over this substrate: detecting conflicts, localizing misalignment via typed discrepancies (teleological, epistemic, procedural), and triggering bounded negotiation through decision slices. Commitment gating blocks action on uncommitted load-bearing premises unless overridden under logged risk; value-gated challenge allocates probing under interaction cost. Trust then attaches to auditable premises and evidence standards, not conversational fluency. We illustrate with tutoring and propose falsifiable evaluation criteria."}

Recent approaches propose mitigating this issue by increasing inference-time structural constraints, either by encouraging abstract intermediate representations or by intervening directly in the model's internal computations; however, reliably suppressing semantic interference remains an open challenge. To make formal deduction less sensitive to semantic content, we introduce a framework for abstraction-guided reasoning that explicitly separates structural inference from lexical semantics. We construct paired content-laden and abstract syllogisms and use the model's activations on abstract inputs to define an abstract reasoning space. We then learn lightweight Abstractors that, from content-conditioned residual-stream states, predict representations aligned with this space and integrate these predictions via multi-layer interventions during the forward pass. Using cross-lingual transfer as a test bed, we show that abstraction-aligned steering reduces content-driven errors and improves validity-sensitive performance.

We view beliefs as representations in the model's latent space that emerge in response to a given input, and introduce a metric to quantify their dominance during generation.

Although promising, our analysis reveals a fundamental misalignment between general-purpose post-training and DAC-style inference, which limits the model's capacity to fully leverage this potential. To bridge this gap and fully unlock LLMs' reasoning capabilities on the most challenging tasks, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework to enhance their DAC-style reasoning capacity. At each step, the policy decomposes a problem into a group of subproblems, solves them sequentially, and addresses the original one conditioned on the subproblem solutions, with both decomposition and solution integrated into RL training.

The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a Reward-free Alignment framework for Conflicted Objectives (RACO) that directly leverages pairwise preference data and resolves gradient conflicts via a novel clipped variant of conflict-averse gradient descent. We provide convergence guarantees to Pareto-critical points that respect user-specified objective weights, and further show that clipping can strictly improve convergence rate in the two-objective setting. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct experiments to demonstrate the compatibility of the proposed framework for LLM alignment. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on multi-objective summarization and safety alignment tasks across multiple LLM families (Qwen 3, Llama 3, Gemma 3) show that our method consistently achieves better Pareto trade-offs compared to existing multi-objective alignment baselines."}
