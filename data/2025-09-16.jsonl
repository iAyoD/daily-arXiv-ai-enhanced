Classical Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is typically formulated as\nanswering one single question by actively exploring a 3D environment. Real\ndeployments, however, often demand handling multiple questions that may arrive\nasynchronously and carry different urgencies. We formalize this setting as\nEmbodied Questions Answering (EQsA) and present ParaEQsA, a framework for\nparallel, urgency-aware scheduling and answering. ParaEQsA leverages a group\nmemory module shared among questions to reduce redundant exploration, and a\npriority-planning module to dynamically schedule questions. To evaluate this\nsetting, we contribute the Parallel Asynchronous Embodied Questions (PAEQs)\nbenchmark containing 40 indoor scenes and five questions per scene (200 in\ntotal), featuring asynchronous follow-up questions and urgency labels. We\nfurther propose metrics for EQsA performance: Direct Answer Rate (DAR), and\nNormalized Urgency-Weighted Latency (NUWL), which jointly measure efficiency\nand responsiveness of this system. ParaEQsA consistently outperforms strong\nsequential baselines adapted from recent EQA systems, while reducing\nexploration and delay. Empirical evaluations investigate the relative\ncontributions of priority, urgency modeling, spatial scope, reward estimation,\nand dependency reasoning within our framework. Together, these results\ndemonstrate that urgency-aware, parallel scheduling is key to making embodied\nagents responsive and efficient under realistic, multi-question workloads."}

A\nprimary bottleneck is the reliance on coordinate-dependent models, which leads\nto profound data inefficiency by failing to generalize physical interactions\nacross different frames of reference. This forces learning algorithms to\nrediscover fundamental physical principles in every new orientation,\nartificially inflating the complexity of the learning task. This paper\nintroduces a novel framework that synergizes a coordinate-free, unreduced\nmultibody dynamics and kinematics model based on tensor mechanics with a\nData-Assisted Control (DAC) architecture. A non-recursive, closed-form\nNewton-Euler model in an augmented matrix form is derived that is optimized for\ntensor-based control design. This structure enables a principled decomposition\nof the system into a structurally certain, physically grounded part and an\nuncertain, empirical, and interaction-focused part, mediated by a virtual port\nvariable. Then, a complete, end-to-end tensor-invariant pipeline for modeling,\ncontrol, and learning is proposed. The coordinate-free control laws for the\nstructurally certain part provide a stable and abstract command interface,\nproven via Lyapunov analysis. Eventually, the model and closed-loop system are\nvalidated through simulations. This work provides a naturally ideal input for\ndata-efficient, frame-invariant learning algorithms, such as equivariant\nlearning, designed to learn the uncertain interaction. The synergy directly\naddresses the data-inefficiency problem, increases explainability and\ninterpretability, and paves the way for more robust and generalizable robotic\ncontrol in interactive environments."}

Existing\nmotorized LiDAR systems, however, typically employ constant-speed scanning that\ndisregards both scene structure and map priors, leading to wasted effort in\nfeature-sparse regions and degraded localization accuracy. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Adaptive LiDAR Scanning with OSM guidance, a framework\nthat integrates global priors with local observability prediction to improve\nlocalization robustness.
