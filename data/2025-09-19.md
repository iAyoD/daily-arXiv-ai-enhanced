TL;DR: AEGIS是一个自动化错误生成和识别框架，通过向成功的多智能体系统轨迹中注入可控错误来创建大规模错误数据集，支持监督微调、强化学习和对比学习三种范式，显著提升错误识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统日益自主和复杂，但缺乏大规模、多样化的错误标注数据集，严重阻碍了系统可靠性和安全性研究。

Method: 使用基于LLM的上下文感知自适应操纵器，通过提示注入和响应破坏等复杂攻击方式，在成功轨迹中系统性地注入可控、可追踪的错误，生成真实失败场景数据集。

Result: 在三种学习范式上都取得了显著改进，多个微调模型的性能与规模大一个数量级的专有系统相当甚至更优。

Conclusion: AEGIS框架是开发更鲁棒和可解释多智能体系统的关键资源，自动化数据生成方法有效解决了错误标注数据稀缺的问题。

Abstract: As Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) become increasingly autonomous and complex,
understanding their error modes is critical for ensuring their reliability and
safety. However, research in this area has been severely hampered by the lack
of large-scale, diverse datasets with precise, ground-truth error labels. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce \textbf{AEGIS}, a novel framework for
\textbf{A}utomated \textbf{E}rror \textbf{G}eneration and
\textbf{I}dentification for Multi-Agent \textbf{S}ystems. By systematically
injecting controllable and traceable errors into initially successful
trajectories, we create a rich dataset of realistic failures. This is achieved
using a context-aware, LLM-based adaptive manipulator that performs
sophisticated attacks like prompt injection and response corruption to induce
specific, predefined error modes. We demonstrate the value of our dataset by
exploring three distinct learning paradigms for the error identification task:
Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning. Our
comprehensive experiments show that models trained on AEGIS data achieve
substantial improvements across all three learning paradigms. Notably, several
of our fine-tuned models demonstrate performance competitive with or superior
to proprietary systems an order of magnitude larger, validating our automated
data generation framework as a crucial resource for developing more robust and
interpretable multi-agent systems. Our project website is available at

*Hao Jiang,Zhipeng Zhang,Yu Gao,Zhigang Sun,Yiru Wang,Yuwen Heng,Shuo Wang,Jinhao Chai,Zhuo Chen,Hao Zhao,Hao Sun,Xi Zhang,Anqing Jiang,Chuan Hu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FlowDrive是一个端到端自动驾驶框架，通过引入物理可解释的能量流场（风险势场和车道吸引场）来编码语义先验和安全提示，提升运动规划的安全性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶框架依赖隐式学习的BEV特征，缺乏对风险和引导先验的显式建模，无法保证安全且可解释的规划。

Method: 提出FlowDrive框架：1）引入风险势场和车道吸引场编码语义先验；2）使用条件扩散规划器解耦运动意图预测和轨迹去噪；3）通过特征级门控增强多模态多样性。

Result: 在NAVSIM v2基准测试中达到86.3的EPDMS分数，在安全性和规划质量方面均超越现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FlowDrive通过显式建模风险流场和语义先验，实现了更安全、可解释且性能优越的自动驾驶运动规划。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving leverage multi-view images
to construct BEV representations for motion planning. In motion planning,
autonomous vehicles need considering both hard constraints imposed by
geometrically occupied obstacles (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) and soft,
rule-based semantics with no explicit geometry (e.g., lane boundaries, traffic
priors). However, existing end-to-end frameworks typically rely on BEV features
learned in an implicit manner, lacking explicit modeling of risk and guidance
priors for safe and interpretable planning. To address this, we propose
FlowDrive, a novel framework that introduces physically interpretable
energy-based flow fields-including risk potential and lane attraction fields-to
encode semantic priors and safety cues into the BEV space. These flow-aware
features enable adaptive refinement of anchor trajectories and serve as
interpretable guidance for trajectory generation. Moreover, FlowDrive decouples
motion intent prediction from trajectory denoising via a conditional diffusion
planner with feature-level gating, alleviating task interference and enhancing
multimodal diversity. Experiments on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrate that
FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance with an EPDMS of 86.3,
surpassing prior baselines in both safety and planning quality. The project is
available at https://astrixdrive.github.io/FlowDrive.github.io/.

### [3] [Multi-Quadruped Cooperative Object Transport: Learning Decentralized Pinch-Lift-Move](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14342)
*Bikram Pandit,Aayam Kumar Shrestha,Alan Fern*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种去中心化的多足机器人协同运输方法，通过接触力而非机械连接实现无通信协调，使用分层策略架构和星座奖励公式，可扩展到任意团队规模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法依赖机器人-物体刚性机械连接的局限性，探索在无通信和集中控制条件下，通过纯接触力实现机械独立机器人的协调运输。

Method: 采用分层策略架构分离基座运动与手臂控制，提出星座奖励公式统一位置和方向跟踪以强制刚性接触行为，通过精心设计的奖励和训练课程使机器人表现得像刚性连接。

Result: 在2-10个机器人的团队规模下，对不同几何形状和质量的物体实现了鲁棒的运输，并展示了轻量级物体的仿真到现实迁移结果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过共享策略参数和隐式同步线索实现协调，无需重新训练即可扩展到任意团队规模，为去中心化协同运输提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study decentralized cooperative transport using teams of N-quadruped
robots with arm that must pinch, lift, and move ungraspable objects through
physical contact alone. Unlike prior work that relies on rigid mechanical
coupling between robots and objects, we address the more challenging setting
where mechanically independent robots must coordinate through contact forces
alone without any communication or centralized control. To this end, we employ
a hierarchical policy architecture that separates base locomotion from arm
control, and propose a constellation reward formulation that unifies position
and orientation tracking to enforce rigid contact behavior. The key insight is
encouraging robots to behave as if rigidly connected to the object through
careful reward design and training curriculum rather than explicit mechanical
constraints. Our approach enables coordination through shared policy parameters
and implicit synchronization cues - scaling to arbitrary team sizes without
retraining. We show extensive simulation experiments to demonstrate robust
transport across 2-10 robots on diverse object geometries and masses, along
with sim2real transfer results on lightweight objects.

*Zhengyang Kris Weng,Matthew L. Elwin,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LeVR是一个模块化软件框架，通过VR遥操作解决机器人模仿学习中的数据收集问题，并与LeRobot框架集成，提供从数据收集到策略部署的端到端工作流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人模仿学习中两个关键问题：为配备灵巧手的机械臂提供强大直观的VR遥操作数据收集系统，以及与现有模仿学习框架的集成问题。

Method: 开发LeVR模块化框架，提供VR遥操作功能；实现LeFranX开源实现（针对Franka FER臂和RobotEra XHand）；收集100个专家演示数据集用于微调视觉运动策略。

Result: 成功验证系统，收集了公开数据集并用于微调最先进的视觉运动策略，实现了从数据收集到真实世界策略部署的无缝工作流。

Conclusion: LeVR框架有效解决了机器人模仿学习中的数据收集和集成问题，通过开源框架、实现和数据集加速机器人社区的模仿学习研究。

Abstract: We introduce LeVR, a modular software framework designed to bridge two
critical gaps in robotic imitation learning. First, it provides robust and
intuitive virtual reality (VR) teleoperation for data collection using robot
arms paired with dexterous hands, addressing a common limitation in existing
systems. Second, it natively integrates with the powerful LeRobot imitation
learning (IL) framework, enabling the use of VR-based teleoperation data and
streamlining the demonstration collection process. To demonstrate LeVR, we
release LeFranX, an open-source implementation for the Franka FER arm and
RobotEra XHand, two widely used research platforms. LeFranX delivers a
seamless, end-to-end workflow from data collection to real-world policy
deployment. We validate our system by collecting a public dataset of 100 expert
demonstrations and use it to successfully fine-tune state-of-the-art visuomotor
policies. We provide our open-source framework, implementation, and dataset to
accelerate IL research for the robotics community.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DreamControl结合扩散模型和强化学习，利用人类运动数据训练的扩散先验指导RL策略，实现人形机器人全身技能学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决人形机器人同时控制上下半身并与物体交互的复杂任务，需要结合人类运动数据的自然性和RL的任务完成能力

Method: 使用人类运动数据训练扩散先验模型，然后用这个先验指导模拟环境中的RL策略学习特定任务

Result: 该方法能够发现直接RL无法达到的解决方案，产生的动作更加自然，有助于仿真到现实的迁移，在Unitree G1机器人上验证了有效性

Conclusion: DreamControl通过结合扩散模型和RL的优势，为人形机器人学习复杂的全身控制技能提供了一种有效的方法

Abstract: We introduce DreamControl, a novel methodology for learning autonomous
whole-body humanoid skills. DreamControl leverages the strengths of diffusion
models and Reinforcement Learning (RL): our core innovation is the use of a
diffusion prior trained on human motion data, which subsequently guides an RL
policy in simulation to complete specific tasks of interest (e.g., opening a
drawer or picking up an object). We demonstrate that this human motion-informed
prior allows RL to discover solutions unattainable by direct RL, and that
diffusion models inherently promote natural looking motions, aiding in
sim-to-real transfer. We validate DreamControl's effectiveness on a Unitree G1
robot across a diverse set of challenging tasks involving simultaneous lower
and upper body control and object interaction.

### [6] [CRAFT: Coaching Reinforcement Learning Autonomously using Foundation Models for Multi-Robot Coordination Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14380)
*Seoyeon Choi,Kanghyun Ryu,Jonghoon Ock,Negar Mehr*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CRAFT是一个利用基础模型作为"教练"的多机器人协调框架，通过LLM自动分解长时程任务为子任务序列，使用LLM生成奖励函数，并通过VLM引导的奖励精炼循环训练每个子任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类通过分阶段课程学习复杂协调的启发，解决MARL在机器人应用中面临的高维连续动作空间、复杂奖励设计和非平稳转换等挑战。

Method: 使用LLM的规划能力自动分解长时程协调任务为子任务序列，用LLM生成奖励函数训练每个子任务，并通过VLM引导的奖励精炼循环进行优化。

Result: 在多四足机器人导航和双手操作任务上验证了CRAFT学习复杂协调行为的能力，并在真实硬件实验中验证了多四足导航策略。

Conclusion: CRAFT框架成功利用基础模型的推理能力，为多机器人协调任务提供自动化的教练功能，能够有效学习复杂的协调行为。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a powerful framework for
learning coordination in multi-agent systems. However, applying MARL to
robotics still remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous joint
action spaces, complex reward design, and non-stationary transitions inherent
to decentralized settings. On the other hand, humans learn complex coordination
through staged curricula, where long-horizon behaviors are progressively built
upon simpler skills. Motivated by this, we propose CRAFT: Coaching
Reinforcement learning Autonomously using Foundation models for multi-robot
coordination Tasks, a framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of
foundation models to act as a "coach" for multi-robot coordination. CRAFT
automatically decomposes long-horizon coordination tasks into sequences of
subtasks using the planning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). In what
follows, CRAFT trains each subtask using reward functions generated by LLM, and
refines them through a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided reward-refinement
loop. We evaluate CRAFT on multi-quadruped navigation and bimanual manipulation
tasks, demonstrating its capability to learn complex coordination behaviors. In
addition, we validate the multi-quadruped navigation policy in real hardware
experiments.

### [7] [RLBind: Adversarial-Invariant Cross-Modal Alignment for Unified Robust Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14383)
*Yuhong Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RLBind是一个两阶段对抗不变性跨模态对齐框架，通过强化视觉编码器和利用跨模态对应关系，在保持泛化能力的同时提升多模态编码器对对抗性和自然损坏的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的防御方法通常在CLIP风格编码器中对齐干净和对抗特征，但忽视了更广泛的跨模态对应关系，导致增益有限且往往损害零样本迁移能力。机器人部署中视觉分支面临对抗性和自然损坏，鲁棒性成为安全前提。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段对干净-对抗对进行无监督微调以强化视觉编码器；第二阶段通过最小化干净/对抗特征与文本锚点之间的差异来利用跨模态对应，同时强制跨模态的类级分布对齐。

Result: 在图像、音频、热成像和视频数据上的广泛实验表明，RLBind在干净准确率和有界对抗鲁棒性方面均优于LanguageBind主干和标准微调基线。

Conclusion: RLBind在不牺牲泛化能力的情况下提高了鲁棒性，为具身机器人在导航、操作和其他自主场景中提供了更安全的多传感器感知堆栈的实用路径。

Abstract: Unified multi-modal encoders that bind vision, audio, and other sensors into
a shared embedding space are attractive building blocks for robot perception
and decision-making. However, on-robot deployment exposes the vision branch to
adversarial and natural corruptions, making robustness a prerequisite for
safety. Prior defenses typically align clean and adversarial features within
CLIP-style encoders and overlook broader cross-modal correspondence, yielding
modest gains and often degrading zero-shot transfer. We introduce RLBind, a
two-stage adversarial-invariant cross-modal alignment framework for robust
unified embeddings. Stage 1 performs unsupervised fine-tuning on
clean-adversarial pairs to harden the visual encoder. Stage 2 leverages
cross-modal correspondence by minimizing the discrepancy between
clean/adversarial features and a text anchor, while enforcing class-wise
distributional alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on Image,
Audio, Thermal, and Video data show that RLBind consistently outperforms the
LanguageBind backbone and standard fine-tuning baselines in both clean accuracy
and norm-bounded adversarial robustness. By improving resilience without
sacrificing generalization, RLBind provides a practical path toward safer
multi-sensor perception stacks for embodied robots in navigation, manipulation,
and other autonomy settings.

### [8] [GestOS: Advanced Hand Gesture Interpretation via Large Language Models to control Any Type of Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14412)
*Artem Lykov,Oleg Kobzarev,Dzmitry Tsetserukou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GestOS是一个基于手势的操作系统，通过语义理解和LLM推理实现多机器人团队的智能任务分配，无需用户明确指定目标或命令。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手势控制系统通常将手势映射为固定命令或单机器人动作，缺乏对多机器人团队的语义理解和动态任务分配能力。

Method: 结合轻量级视觉感知和大型语言模型：将手部姿态转换为结构化文本描述，LLM推断意图并生成机器人特定命令，实时匹配最适合的机器人执行任务。

Result: 实现了上下文感知的自适应控制，支持在动态环境中与机器人系统进行可扩展、灵活和用户友好的协作。

Conclusion: GestOS将手势交互从简单识别推进到智能编排，为异构机器人团队提供了语义化的高级控制方案。

Abstract: We present GestOS, a gesture-based operating system for high-level control of
heterogeneous robot teams. Unlike prior systems that map gestures to fixed
commands or single-agent actions, GestOS interprets hand gestures semantically
and dynamically distributes tasks across multiple robots based on their
capabilities, current state, and supported instruction sets. The system
combines lightweight visual perception with large language model (LLM)
reasoning: hand poses are converted into structured textual descriptions, which
the LLM uses to infer intent and generate robot-specific commands. A robot
selection module ensures that each gesture-triggered task is matched to the
most suitable agent in real time. This architecture enables context-aware,
adaptive control without requiring explicit user specification of targets or
commands. By advancing gesture interaction from recognition to intelligent
orchestration, GestOS supports scalable, flexible, and user-friendly
collaboration with robotic systems in dynamic environments.

### [9] [Perception-Integrated Safety Critical Control via Analytic Collision Cone Barrier Functions on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14421)
*Dario Tscholl,Yashwanth Nakka,Brian Gunter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出基于3D高斯泼溅的感知驱动安全滤波器，将每个3DGS转换为闭式前向碰撞锥，生成一阶控制屏障函数，实现高效实时的避障导航


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于距离的CBF方法反应性较强，只在障碍物接近时才激活，需要更早预警的主动避障方法以提高安全性和运动平滑性

Method: 利用泼溅的解析几何特性，将3D高斯泼溅转换为闭式碰撞锥，构建一阶CBF并嵌入二次规划问题，通过Minkowski和膨胀处理机器人物理尺寸

Result: 在包含17万个泼溅的大规模场景中，规划时间减少3倍，轨迹抖动显著降低，同时保持相同安全水平

Conclusion: 该方法完全解析、无需高阶CBF扩展，计算高效，适用于空间机器人和卫星系统等感知驱动的极端环境实时导航

Abstract: We present a perception-driven safety filter that converts each 3D Gaussian
Splat (3DGS) into a closed-form forward collision cone, which in turn yields a
first-order control barrier function (CBF) embedded within a quadratic program
(QP). By exploiting the analytic geometry of splats, our formulation provides a
continuous, closed-form representation of collision constraints that is both
simple and computationally efficient. Unlike distance-based CBFs, which tend to
activate reactively only when an obstacle is already close, our collision-cone
CBF activates proactively, allowing the robot to adjust earlier and thereby
produce smoother and safer avoidance maneuvers at lower computational cost. We
validate the method on a large synthetic scene with approximately 170k splats,
where our filter reduces planning time by a factor of 3 and significantly
decreased trajectory jerk compared to a state-of-the-art 3DGS planner, while
maintaining the same level of safety. The approach is entirely analytic,
requires no high-order CBF extensions (HOCBFs), and generalizes naturally to
robots with physical extent through a principled Minkowski-sum inflation of the
splats. These properties make the method broadly applicable to real-time
navigation in cluttered, perception-derived extreme environments, including
space robotics and satellite systems.

*Keqin Wang,Tao Zhong,David Chang,Christine Allen-Blanchette*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了LEGO框架，通过图神经网络实现置换等变性和E(n)等变性，解决多智能体强化学习在竞争性任务中的训练不稳定、泛化能力差等问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体强化学习在竞争性设置中同时适应导致训练不稳定、非动力学对策在不利条件下失效、以及策略在不同智能体数量环境中泛化能力差的问题

Method: 提出Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (LEGO)框架，集成图神经网络捕捉置换等变性和泛化能力，使用规范化实现E(n)-等变性，采用异构表示编码角色特定的归纳偏置

Result: 在合作和竞争性群体基准测试中优于强基线并提升泛化能力，在真实世界实验中展示了对不同团队规模和智能体故障的鲁棒性

Conclusion: LEGO框架有效解决了多智能体强化学习的关键挑战，提供了更好的训练稳定性和泛化性能

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for coordinating swarms of agents in complex decision-making, yet major
challenges remain. In competitive settings such as pursuer-evader tasks,
simultaneous adaptation can destabilize training; non-kinetic countermeasures
often fail under adverse conditions; and policies trained in one configuration
rarely generalize to environments with a different number of agents. To address
these issues, we propose the Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural
Networks (LEGO) framework, which integrates seamlessly with popular MARL
algorithms such as MAPPO. LEGO employs graph neural networks to capture
permutation equivariance and generalization to different agent numbers,
canonicalization to enforce E(n)-equivariance, and heterogeneous
representations to encode role-specific inductive biases. Experiments on
cooperative and competitive swarm benchmarks show that LEGO outperforms strong
baselines and improves generalization. In real-world experiments, LEGO
demonstrates robustness to varying team sizes and agent failure.

### [11] [Online Learning of Deceptive Policies under Intermittent Observation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14453)
*Gokul Puthumanaillam,Ram Padmanabhan,Jose Fuentes,Nicole Cruz,Paulo Padrao,Ruben Hernandez,Hao Jiang,William Schafer,Leonardo Bobadilla,Melkior Ornik*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文研究在间歇性监控环境下，智能体如何通过心理理论(Theory of Mind)实现欺骗性行为，在追求私有目标的同时保持对监督者参考策略的表面合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的监督控制往往不是连续监控，而是在已知时间间隔内进行间歇性观察。智能体需要在这种环境下既实现自身目标，又能在被观察时显得合规，这需要理解监督者的期望和信念。

Method: 利用心理理论建模监督者的期望，从中提取一个标量指标——预期偏差证据。将该标量作为状态依赖权重注入到在线强化学习的KL正则化策略改进步骤中，实现自我利益与合规性的平滑权衡。

Result: 在海洋(ASV)和空中(UAV)导航的真实硬件实验中，该方法能够在线运行，实现高回报和成功率，同时观察轨迹证据与监督者期望保持校准。

Conclusion: 心理理论可以有效地指导在线强化学习产生欺骗性行为，避免了手工设计或启发式策略，在真实世界的间歇性监控环境中表现出色。

Abstract: In supervisory control settings, autonomous systems are not monitored
continuously. Instead, monitoring often occurs at sporadic intervals within
known bounds. We study the problem of deception, where an agent pursues a
private objective while remaining plausibly compliant with a supervisor's
reference policy when observations occur. Motivated by the behavior of real,
human supervisors, we situate the problem within Theory of Mind: the
representation of what an observer believes and expects to see. We show that
Theory of Mind can be repurposed to steer online reinforcement learning (RL)
toward such deceptive behavior. We model the supervisor's expectations and
distill from them a single, calibrated scalar -- the expected evidence of
deviation if an observation were to happen now. This scalar combines how unlike
the reference and current action distributions appear, with the agent's belief
that an observation is imminent. Injected as a state-dependent weight into a
KL-regularized policy improvement step within an online RL loop, this scalar
informs a closed-form update that smoothly trades off self-interest and
compliance, thus sidestepping hand-crafted or heuristic policies. In
real-world, real-time hardware experiments on marine (ASV) and aerial (UAV)
navigation, our ToM-guided RL runs online, achieves high return and success
with observed-trace evidence calibrated to the supervisor's expectations.

### [12] [Learning Discrete Abstractions for Visual Rearrangement Tasks Using Vision-Guided Graph Coloring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14460)
*Abhiroop Ajith,Constantinos Chamzas*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种从视觉数据自动发现离散图结构抽象的方法，用于机器人重排任务规划，结合结构约束和注意力引导的视觉距离，无需人工设计抽象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够自然地在抽象层次进行推理，而机器人中的抽象通常需要人工设计，限制了可扩展性和实际应用。需要从视觉数据自动发现有用的抽象来支持高层规划。

Method: 结合结构约束和注意力引导的视觉距离，利用重排问题固有的二分图结构，将结构约束和视觉嵌入整合到统一框架中，从纯视觉数据自主发现抽象。

Result: 在仿真环境中的两个重排任务上评估，方法能够一致地识别出有意义的抽象，支持有效规划，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从视觉数据自动发现有用的抽象表示，为机器人高层规划提供支持，在重排任务中表现出色，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Learning abstractions directly from data is a core challenge in robotics.
Humans naturally operate at an abstract level, reasoning over high-level
subgoals while delegating execution to low-level motor skills -- an ability
that enables efficient problem solving in complex environments. In robotics,
abstractions and hierarchical reasoning have long been central to planning, yet
they are typically hand-engineered, demanding significant human effort and
limiting scalability. Automating the discovery of useful abstractions directly
from visual data would make planning frameworks more scalable and more
applicable to real-world robotic domains. In this work, we focus on
rearrangement tasks where the state is represented with raw images, and propose
a method to induce discrete, graph-structured abstractions by combining
structural constraints with an attention-guided visual distance. Our approach
leverages the inherent bipartite structure of rearrangement problems,
integrating structural constraints and visual embeddings into a unified
framework. This enables the autonomous discovery of abstractions from vision
alone, which can subsequently support high-level planning. We evaluate our
method on two rearrangement tasks in simulation and show that it consistently
identifies meaningful abstractions that facilitate effective planning and
outperform existing approaches.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文介绍了GelSight Baby Fin Ray软体机器人手在触觉感知方面的应用，通过机器学习方法实现了坚果壳纹理识别、力和位置估计，并比较了不同神经网络结构的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软体机器人手和触觉传感技术的进步使得能够执行更复杂的任务，但需要进一步探索如何从高分辨率触觉图像中提取有用信息，以增强软体机器人对环境的理解和交互能力。

Method: 使用GelSight Baby Fin Ray触觉传感器，集成摄像头与软性Fin Ray结构，采用ResNet50、GoogLeNet以及3层和5层CNN等神经网络结构进行纹理识别、力和位置估计的消融研究。

Result: 研究表明机器学习能够有效从高分辨率触觉图像中提取有用信息，不同神经网络结构在纹理识别和力/位置估计任务中表现出良好性能。

Conclusion: 机器学习是从触觉图像中提取信息的有效技术，能够赋能软体机器人更好地理解和与环境交互，具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: Recent advances in soft robotic hands and tactile sensing have enabled both
to perform an increasing number of complex tasks with the aid of machine
learning. In particular, we presented the GelSight Baby Fin Ray in our previous
work, which integrates a camera with a soft, compliant Fin Ray structure.
Camera-based tactile sensing gives the GelSight Baby Fin Ray the ability to
capture rich contact information like forces, object geometries, and textures.
Moreover, our previous work showed that the GelSight Baby Fin Ray can dig
through clutter, and classify in-shell nuts. To further examine the potential
of the GelSight Baby Fin Ray, we leverage learning to distinguish nut-in-shell
textures and to perform force and position estimation. We implement ablation
studies with popular neural network structures, including ResNet50, GoogLeNet,
and 3- and 5-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) structures. We conclude
that machine learning is a promising technique to extract useful information
from high-resolution tactile images and empower soft robotics to better
understand and interact with the environments.

### [14] [Event-LAB: Towards Standardized Evaluation of Neuromorphic Localization Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14516)
*Adam D. Hines,Alejandro Fontan,Michael Milford,Tobias Fischer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Event-LAB是一个统一的事件驱动定位框架，使用Pixi包管理器实现单命令安装和调用，支持多种定位方法和数据集，解决了该领域代码依赖和数据格式多样化带来的比较困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件驱动定位研究快速发展，但代码依赖和数据格式多样化使得方法比较和实施变得困难且繁琐，需要一个统一的框架来简化这一过程。

Method: 基于Pixi包和依赖管理器实现Event-LAB框架，支持单命令行安装和调用，实现了视觉位置识别（VPR）和同步定位与建图（SLAM）两种常见事件驱动定位流程。

Result: 框架能够系统地可视化和分析多种方法和数据集的结果，揭示了事件收集计数和帧生成窗口大小等参数对性能的重大影响。

Conclusion: Event-LAB为研究社区提供了公平比较方法的能力，通过一致的参数设置简化了多条件实验设置流程，强调了使用一致事件图像生成参数进行公平比较的重要性。

Abstract: Event-based localization research and datasets are a rapidly growing area of
interest, with a tenfold increase in the cumulative total number of published
papers on this topic over the past 10 years. Whilst the rapid expansion in the
field is exciting, it brings with it an associated challenge: a growth in the
variety of required code and package dependencies as well as data formats,
making comparisons difficult and cumbersome for researchers to implement
reliably. To address this challenge, we present Event-LAB: a new and unified
framework for running several event-based localization methodologies across
multiple datasets. Event-LAB is implemented using the Pixi package and
dependency manager, that enables a single command-line installation and
invocation for combinations of localization methods and datasets. To
demonstrate the capabilities of the framework, we implement two common
event-based localization pipelines: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) and
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). We demonstrate the ability of the
framework to systematically visualize and analyze the results of multiple
methods and datasets, revealing key insights such as the association of
parameters that control event collection counts and window sizes for frame
generation to large variations in performance. The results and analysis

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于人类演示学习的草莓采摘机器人系统，使用4自由度SCARA机械臂和端位姿辅助动作分块Transformer，在遮挡场景下显著优于直接ACT方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 草莓自然生长在簇群中，与叶片、茎干和其他果实交织，导致频繁遮挡，传统感知-规划-控制系统难以在杂乱环境中采摘果实

Method: 采用4自由度SCARA机械臂配合人类遥操作接口收集数据，利用端位姿辅助动作分块Transformer(ACT)开发精细的视觉运动采摘策略

Result: 在各种遮挡场景下的实验表明，改进的方法显著优于直接实施ACT，展现了在实际遮挡草莓采摘中的潜在应用价值

Conclusion: 基于人类演示学习的机器人系统能够有效解决草莓采摘中的遮挡问题，通过精细的视觉运动策略实现成功的果实采摘

Abstract: Strawberries naturally grow in clusters, interwoven with leaves, stems, and
other fruits, which frequently leads to occlusion. This inherent growth habit
presents a significant challenge for robotic picking, as traditional
percept-plan-control systems struggle to reach fruits amid the clutter.
Effectively picking an occluded strawberry demands dexterous manipulation to
carefully bypass or gently move the surrounding soft objects and precisely
access the ideal picking point located at the stem just above the calyx. To
address this challenge, we introduce a strawberry-picking robotic system that
learns from human demonstrations. Our system features a 4-DoF SCARA arm paired
with a human teleoperation interface for efficient data collection and
leverages an End Pose Assisted Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) to develop a
fine-grained visuomotor picking policy. Experiments under various occlusion
scenarios demonstrate that our modified approach significantly outperforms the
direct implementation of ACT, underscoring its potential for practical
application in occluded strawberry picking.

<details>

Motivation: 解决材料实验室振动筛自动化操作中的三个关键挑战：狭窄空间的双臂盖操作、重叠工作空间的双手交接、以及有方向约束的受阻粉末容器递送

Method: 分层规划框架结合先验引导路径规划和多步轨迹优化，前者使用有限高斯混合模型提高狭窄通道采样效率，后者通过缩短、简化、施加关节约束和B样条平滑来优化路径

Result: 规划时间减少80.4%，路径点减少89.4%，并在物理实验中成功完成完整的振动筛操作流程

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了复杂实验室自动化中的操作挑战，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of automating vibratory sieve shaker
operations in a materials laboratory, focusing on three critical tasks: 1)
dual-arm lid manipulation in 3 cm clearance spaces, 2) bimanual handover in
overlapping workspaces, and 3) obstructed powder sample container delivery with
orientation constraints. These tasks present significant challenges, including
inefficient sampling in narrow passages, the need for smooth trajectories to
prevent spillage, and suboptimal paths generated by conventional methods. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a hierarchical planning framework
combining Prior-Guided Path Planning and Multi-Step Trajectory Optimization.
The former uses a finite Gaussian mixture model to improve sampling efficiency
in narrow passages, while the latter refines paths by shortening, simplifying,
imposing joint constraints, and B-spline smoothing. Experimental results
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness: planning time is reduced by up to
80.4%, and waypoints are decreased by 89.4%. Furthermore, the system completes
the full vibratory sieve shaker operation workflow in a physical experiment,
validating its practical applicability for complex laboratory automation.

Abstract: Curated datasets are essential for training and evaluating AI approaches, but
are often lacking in domains where language and physical action are deeply
intertwined. In particular, few datasets capture how people acquire embodied
skills through verbal instruction over time. To address this gap, we introduce
SimCoachCorpus: a unique dataset of race car simulator driving that allows for
the investigation of rich interactive phenomena during guided and unguided
motor skill acquisition. In this dataset, 29 humans were asked to drive in a
simulator around a race track for approximately ninety minutes. Fifteen
participants were given personalized one-on-one instruction from a professional
performance driving coach, and 14 participants drove without coaching. \name\
includes embodied features such as vehicle state and inputs, map (track
boundaries and raceline), and cone landmarks. These are synchronized with
concurrent verbal coaching from a professional coach and additional feedback at
the end of each lap. We further provide annotations of coaching categories for
each concurrent feedback utterance, ratings on students' compliance with
coaching advice, and self-reported cognitive load and emotional state of
participants (gathered from surveys during the study). The dataset includes
over 20,000 concurrent feedback utterances, over 400 terminal feedback
utterances, and over 40 hours of vehicle driving data. Our naturalistic dataset
can be used for investigating motor learning dynamics, exploring linguistic
phenomena, and training computational models of teaching. We demonstrate
applications of this dataset for in-context learning, imitation learning, and

Motivation: 解决可重构机器人在拆卸约束结构时面临的大规模复杂搜索空间问题，避免系统陷入局部最优，提高自动化拆卸的效率和适应性。

Method: 集成多机械臂和旋转台的可重构系统，采用分层优化方法：使用多目标遗传算法进行序列和任务规划（含运动评估），然后使用约束规划进行调度，并针对约束结构设计了染色体初始化方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的系统集成方法和分层优化策略成功解决了可重构机器人拆卸约束结构的复杂规划问题，为自动化非破坏性拆卸提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This study presents a system integration approach for planning schedules,
sequences, tasks, and motions for reconfigurable robots to automatically
disassemble constrained structures in a non-destructive manner. Such systems
must adapt their configuration and coordination to the target structure, but
the large and complex search space makes them prone to local optima. To address
this, we integrate multiple robot arms equipped with different types of tools,
together with a rotary stage, into a reconfigurable setup. This flexible system
is based on a hierarchical optimization method that generates plans meeting
multiple preferred conditions under mandatory requirements within a realistic
timeframe. The approach employs two many-objective genetic algorithms for
sequence and task planning with motion evaluations, followed by constraint
programming for scheduling. Because sequence planning has a much larger search
space, we introduce a chromosome initialization method tailored to constrained
structures to mitigate the risk of local optima. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed method effectively solves complex problems in reconfigurable
robotic disassembly.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过设计对机器人配置变换等变的动作空间和策略来解决跨具身预训练中配置泛化问题的新框架，包括动作解码器和几何感知网络架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作策略在大规模预训练中虽然能够学习跨任务、环境和具身的操作技能，但对新颖机器人配置的泛化能力有限。大多数方法过于关注模型规模和数据集多样性，而忽视了动作空间的设计，导致需要昂贵的适配成本。

Method: 1) 建立具身等变性理论来指导动作空间和策略设计；2) 引入强制配置等变的动作解码器；3) 整合几何感知网络架构以增强与具身无关的空间推理能力。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中的大量实验表明，该方法提高了预训练效果，并能够在新颖机器人具身上实现高效的微调。

Conclusion: 通过将跨具身预训练形式化为对具身配置变换等变的策略设计问题，该框架有效解决了配置泛化挑战，为机器人学习提供了更强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language-action policies learn manipulation skills across tasks,
environments and embodiments through large-scale pre-training. However, their
ability to generalize to novel robot configurations remains limited. Most
approaches emphasize model size, dataset scale and diversity while paying less
attention to the design of action spaces. This leads to the configuration
generalization problem, which requires costly adaptation. We address this
challenge by formulating cross-embodiment pre-training as designing policies
equivariant to embodiment configuration transformations. Building on this
principle, we propose a framework that (i) establishes a embodiment
equivariance theory for action space and policy design, (ii) introduces an
action decoder that enforces configuration equivariance, and (iii) incorporates
a geometry-aware network architecture to enhance embodiment-agnostic spatial
reasoning. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings
demonstrate that our approach improves pre-training effectiveness and enables
efficient fine-tuning on novel robot embodiments. Our code is available at

TL;DR: BEV-ODOM2是一个改进的鸟瞰图视觉里程计框架，通过密集BEV光流监督和PV-BEV融合技术，解决了现有BEV方法监督信号稀疏和信息丢失的问题，在多个数据集上实现了40%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的鸟瞰图(BEV)方法在单目视觉里程计中存在监督信号稀疏和透视到BEV投影过程中的信息丢失问题，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出密集BEV光流监督（从3-DoF位姿真值构建）和PV-BEV融合（在投影前计算相关体积以保持6-DoF运动线索），采用三级监督机制和增强的旋转采样策略。

Result: 在KITTI、NCLT、Oxford和新收集的ZJH-VO多尺度数据集上实现了最先进的性能，相对位姿误差(RTE)相比之前BEV方法提升了40%。

Conclusion: BEV-ODOM2框架有效解决了BEV方法的监督稀疏和信息丢失问题，无需额外标注即可显著提升性能，同时公开了ZJH-VO数据集促进未来研究。

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representation offers a metric-scaled planar workspace,
facilitating the simplification of 6-DoF ego-motion to a more robust 3-DoF
model for monocular visual odometry (MVO) in intelligent transportation
systems. However, existing BEV methods suffer from sparse supervision signals
and information loss during perspective-to-BEV projection. We present
BEV-ODOM2, an enhanced framework addressing both limitations without additional
annotations. Our approach introduces: (1) dense BEV optical flow supervision
constructed from 3-DoF pose ground truth for pixel-level guidance; (2) PV-BEV
fusion that computes correlation volumes before projection to preserve 6-DoF
motion cues while maintaining scale consistency. The framework employs three
supervision levels derived solely from pose data: dense BEV flow, 5-DoF for the
PV branch, and final 3-DoF output. Enhanced rotation sampling further balances
diverse motion patterns in training. Extensive evaluation on KITTI, NCLT,
Oxford, and our newly collected ZJH-VO multi-scale dataset demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 40 improvement in RTE compared to
previous BEV methods. The ZJH-VO dataset, covering diverse ground vehicle
scenarios from underground parking to outdoor plazas, is publicly available to
facilitate future research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的无插值三平面提升和体素融合框架，通过直接投影3D体素到平面特征并使用广播和求和重建特征体积，将非线性转移到2D卷积，降低计算复杂度同时保持完全并行化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集3D卷积在感知任务中精度高但计算成本过高，不适合实时机器人系统。现有三平面方法依赖2D图像特征插值、点查询和隐式MLP，计算量大且不适合嵌入式3D推理。

Method: 提出插值自由的三平面提升和体素融合框架，将3D体素直接投影到平面特征，通过广播和求和重建特征体积。添加低分辨率体素分支通过轻量级集成层与提升特征融合，捕获全局上下文。

Result: 在分类、补全、分割和检测任务上的实验表明：分类和补全保持或提高精度，分割和检测在精度略有下降的同时获得显著计算节省。在NVIDIA Jetson Orin nano上的设备基准测试确认了稳健的实时吞吐量。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和精度之间取得了良好平衡，适合嵌入式机器人感知应用，能够实现实时3D推理。

Abstract: Dense 3D convolutions provide high accuracy for perception but are too
computationally expensive for real-time robotic systems. Existing tri-plane
methods rely on 2D image features with interpolation, point-wise queries, and
implicit MLPs, which makes them computationally heavy and unsuitable for
embedded 3D inference. As an alternative, we propose a novel interpolation-free
tri-plane lifting and volumetric fusion framework, that directly projects 3D
voxels into plane features and reconstructs a feature volume through broadcast
and summation. This shifts nonlinearity to 2D convolutions, reducing complexity
while remaining fully parallelizable. To capture global context, we add a
low-resolution volumetric branch fused with the lifted features through a
lightweight integration layer, yielding a design that is both efficient and
end-to-end GPU-accelerated. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method, we conduct experiments on classification, completion, segmentation, and
detection, and we map the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy across
tasks. Results show that classification and completion retain or improve
accuracy, while segmentation and detection trade modest drops in accuracy for
significant computational savings. On-device benchmarks on an NVIDIA Jetson
Orin nano confirm robust real-time throughput, demonstrating the suitability of
the approach for embedded robotic perception.

Abstract: The emerging field of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for humanoid robots faces
several fundamental challenges, including the high cost of data acquisition,
the lack of a standardized benchmark, and the significant gap between

RealMirror, a comprehensive, open-source embodied AI VLA platform. RealMirror
builds an efficient, low-cost data collection, model training, and inference
system that enables end-to-end VLA research without requiring a real robot. To
facilitate model evolution and fair comparison, we also introduce a dedicated
VLA benchmark for humanoid robots, featuring multiple scenarios, extensive
trajectories, and various VLA models. Furthermore, by integrating generative
models and 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct realistic environments and
robot models, we successfully demonstrate zero-shot Sim2Real transfer, where
models trained exclusively on simulation data can perform tasks on a real robot
seamlessly, without any fine-tuning. In conclusion, with the unification of
these critical components, RealMirror provides a robust framework that
significantly accelerates the development of VLA models for humanoid robots.

Abstract: Tactile-aware robot learning faces critical challenges in data collection and

feedback in existing systems. To address these limitations, we introduce a
tactile robot learning system with both hardware and algorithm innovations. We
present exUMI, an extensible data collection device that enhances the vanilla

propose Tactile Prediction Pretraining (TPP), a representation learning
framework through action-aware temporal tactile prediction, capturing contact

outperforms traditional tactile imitation learning. Our work bridges the gap

Motivation: 重新审视Wohlhart在ARK 2004提出的三环空间连杆机构（基于Baker 1980年的两环机构扩展），Diez-Martinez等人在ARK 2006已分析过，但需要进一步研究其局部运动特性。

Method: 采用局部分析方法，计算运动切锥和构型空间的局部近似，分析机构的微分自由度和构型空间特性。

Result: 发现该机构在参考配置下有限自由度为3（过约束），但微分自由度为5；构型空间是局部光滑流形，参考配置不是奇点；微分自由度局部恒定，表明机构是摇动的。

Conclusion: 该三环空间连杆机构具有独特的运动特性：虽然是过约束机构，但在参考配置下不是构型空间奇点，且具有局部恒定的微分自由度，属于摇动机构。

Abstract: This paper revisits a three-loop spatial linkage that was proposed in an ARK
2004 paper by Karl Wohlhart (as extension of a two-loop linkage proposed by
Eddie Baker in 1980) and later analyzed in an ARK 2006 paper by Diez-Martinez
et. al. A local analysis shows that this linkage has a finite degree of freedom
(DOF) 3 (and is thus overconstrained) while in its reference configuration the
differential DOF is 5. It is shown that its configuration space is locally a
smooth manifold so that the reference configuration is not a c-space
singularity. It is shown that the differential DOF is locally constant, which
makes this linkage shaky (so that the reference configuration is not a
singularity). The higher-order local analysis is facilitated by the computation
of the kinematic tangent cone as well as a local approximation of the c-space.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无参考的无人机竞速控制方法，通过将基于强化学习的门进度目标直接整合到MPPI框架中，实现了与传统基于参考方法相竞争甚至更优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模型的控制器在无人机竞速中依赖预计算的参考轨迹，限制了性能。虽然轮廓控制放宽了对完整状态参考的要求，但仍需要几何路径参考。强化学习研究表明许多控制器优化的是替代目标（如轨迹跟踪）而非直接最大化通过门的进度。

Method: 将基于强化学习奖励塑造的门进度目标直接整合到模型预测路径积分(MPPI)框架中，利用MPPI的采样特性实时优化不连续且不可微的目标函数。建立了统一框架系统比较三种目标函数：传统轨迹跟踪、轮廓控制和提出的门进度目标。

Result: 提出的无参考方法实现了具有竞争力的竞速性能，与基于参考的方法相当甚至更优。MPPI在优化不连续目标方面优于传统梯度求解器。

Conclusion: 参考自由的方法通过直接优化竞速目标（门进度）而非替代目标，可以在无人机竞速中实现优异性能，MPPI框架为此类不连续目标的实时优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While model-based controllers have demonstrated remarkable performance in
autonomous drone racing, their performance is often constrained by the reliance
on pre-computed reference trajectories. Conventional approaches, such as
trajectory tracking, demand a dynamically feasible, full-state reference,
whereas contouring control relaxes this requirement to a geometric path but
still necessitates a reference. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning
(RL) have revealed that many model-based controllers optimize surrogate
objectives, such as trajectory tracking, rather than the primary racing goal of
directly maximizing progress through gates. Inspired by these findings, this
work introduces a reference-free method for time-optimal racing by
incorporating this gate progress objective, derived from RL reward shaping,
directly into the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) formulation. The
sampling-based nature of MPPI makes it uniquely capable of optimizing the
discontinuous and non-differentiable objective in real-time. We also establish
a unified framework that leverages MPPI to systematically and fairly compare
three distinct objective functions with a consistent dynamics model and
parameter set: classical trajectory tracking, contouring control, and the
proposed gate progress objective. We compare the performance of these three
objectives when solved via both MPPI and a traditional gradient-based solver.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed reference-free approach achieves
competitive racing performance, rivaling or exceeding reference-based methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了在人类-机器人协作中，非语言沟通（LED灯光信号和情感显示）对安全性和效率的影响，发现情感显示虽能提升交互感知但未显著改善任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在共享工作空间中，有效沟通对安全和效率至关重要，研究旨在了解非语言沟通方式如何影响人类-机器人协作。

Method: 使用Franka Emika Panda机器人，配备末端LED灯带和平板动画面部显示，通过颜色编码信号和面部表情传达运动意图，进行18人参与的协作实验，比较三种条件：仅LED信号、LED加反应式情感显示、LED加预判式情感显示。

Result: 情感显示增加了机器人的交互感知性，但相比仅使用LED信号，并未显著改善碰撞预期、沟通清晰度或任务效率。

Conclusion: 情感线索可以增强用户参与度，但在共享工作空间中对任务性能的影响有限，LED信号本身已足够有效。

Abstract: Effective communication is essential for safety and efficiency in human-robot
collaboration, particularly in shared workspaces. This paper investigates the
impact of nonverbal communication on human-robot interaction (HRI) by
integrating reactive light signals and emotional displays into a robotic
system. We equipped a Franka Emika Panda robot with an LED strip on its end
effector and an animated facial display on a tablet to convey movement intent
through colour-coded signals and facial expressions. We conducted a human-robot
collaboration experiment with 18 participants, evaluating three conditions: LED
signals alone, LED signals with reactive emotional displays, and LED signals
with pre-emptive emotional displays. We collected data through questionnaires
and position tracking to assess anticipation of potential collisions, perceived
clarity of communication, and task performance. The results indicate that while
emotional displays increased the perceived interactivity of the robot, they did
not significantly improve collision anticipation, communication clarity, or
task efficiency compared to LED signals alone. These findings suggest that
while emotional cues can enhance user engagement, their impact on task
performance in shared workspaces is limited.

Abstract: Ensuring safety of vision-based control systems remains a major challenge
hindering their deployment in critical settings. Safety filters have gained
increased interest as effective tools for ensuring the safety of classical
control systems, but their applications in vision-based control settings have
so far been limited. Pre-trained vision models (PVRs) have been shown to be
effective perception backbones for control in various robotics domains. In this
paper, we are interested in examining their effectiveness when used for
designing vision-based safety filters. We use them as backbones for classifiers
defining failure sets, for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based safety
filters, and for latent world models. We discuss the trade-offs between
training from scratch, fine-tuning, and freezing the PVRs when training the
models they are backbones for. We also evaluate whether one of the PVRs is
superior across all tasks, evaluate whether learned world models or Q-functions
are better for switching decisions to safe policies, and discuss practical
considerations for deploying these PVRs on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Manipulation in confined and cluttered environments remains a significant
challenge due to partial observability and complex configuration spaces.
Effective manipulation in such environments requires an intelligent exploration
strategy to safely understand the scene and search the target. In this paper,
we propose COMPASS, a multi-stage exploration and manipulation framework
featuring a manipulation-aware sampling-based planner. First, we reduce
collision risks with a near-field awareness scan to build a local collision
map. Additionally, we employ a multi-objective utility function to find
viewpoints that are both informative and conducive to subsequent manipulation.
Moreover, we perform a constrained manipulation optimization strategy to
generate manipulation poses that respect obstacle constraints. To
systematically evaluate method's performance under these difficulties, we
propose a benchmark of confined-space exploration and manipulation containing
four level challenging scenarios. Compared to exploration methods designed for
other robots and only considering information gain, our framework increases
manipulation success rate by 24.25% in simulations. Real-world experiments
demonstrate our method's capability for active sensing and manipulation in
confined environments.

*Humphrey Munn,Brendan Tidd,Peter Böhm,Marcus Gallagher,David Howard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GCR-PPO是一种改进的强化学习算法，通过多目标梯度冲突解决机制，在机器人控制任务中相比传统PPO方法性能提升9.5%，特别适用于高冲突目标场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习将多目标任务目标聚合为单一标量奖励，导致需要精细的奖励调优、容易陷入局部最优，且随着目标数量增加，调优成本和次优性问题加剧。多目标方法在机器人RL中应用受限主要因为计算成本和优化难度。

Method: 提出GCR-PPO方法，修改actor-critic优化过程：使用多头critic分解actor更新为目标级梯度，基于目标优先级解决梯度冲突。

Result: 在IsaacLab操作和运动基准测试中，相比并行PPO表现出更好的可扩展性(p=0.04)，无显著计算开销。高冲突任务性能提升更明显，平均改进9.5%。

Conclusion: GCR-PPO有效解决了多目标强化学习中的梯度冲突问题，在机器人控制任务中实现了更好的性能和可扩展性，特别适用于目标冲突严重的场景。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) robot controllers usually aggregate many task
objectives into one scalar reward. While large-scale proximal policy
optimisation (PPO) has enabled impressive results such as robust robot
locomotion in the real world, many tasks still require careful reward tuning
and are brittle to local optima. Tuning cost and sub-optimality grow with the
number of objectives, limiting scalability. Modelling reward vectors and their
trade-offs can address these issues; however, multi-objective methods remain
underused in RL for robotics because of computational cost and optimisation
difficulty. In this work, we investigate the conflict between gradient
contributions for each objective that emerge from scalarising the task
objectives. In particular, we explicitly address the conflict between
task-based rewards and terms that regularise the policy towards realistic
behaviour. We propose GCR-PPO, a modification to actor-critic optimisation that
decomposes the actor update into objective-wise gradients using a multi-headed
critic and resolves conflicts based on the objective priority. Our methodology,
GCR-PPO, is evaluated on the well-known IsaacLab manipulation and locomotion
benchmarks and additional multi-objective modifications on two related tasks.
We show superior scalability compared to parallel PPO (p = 0.04), without
significant computational overhead. We also show higher performance with more
conflicting tasks. GCR-PPO improves on large-scale PPO with an average
improvement of 9.5%, with high-conflict tasks observing a greater improvement.

Motivation: 解决现有VLA方法的领域过拟合、不可解释推理和辅助生成模型高延迟等关键限制，推动VLA从不透明的控制器向真正能够与人类推理、行动和协作的辅助代理转变

Method: 采用专家混合设计，整合VLM反思推理和扩散动作生成，通过两阶段训练方法（动作接地和反思调优）支持显式自我反思，并在遇到不确定性或重复失败时主动寻求人类指导

Result: 与生成代理相比，标准化时间减少约2倍，Dream计数减少约4倍，实现了更高的成功率、改进的可解释性以及与现有方法相比平衡的低延迟

Conclusion: 这项工作在将VLA从不透明的控制器转变为真正能够与人类推理、行动和协作的辅助代理方面迈出了开创性的一步

Abstract: In this work, we present CollabVLA, a self-reflective vision-language-action
framework that transforms a standard visuomotor policy into a collaborative
assistant. CollabVLA tackles key limitations of prior VLAs, including domain
overfitting, non-interpretable reasoning, and the high latency of auxiliary
generative models, by integrating VLM-based reflective reasoning with
diffusion-based action generation under a mixture-of-experts design. Through a
two-stage training recipe of action grounding and reflection tuning, it
supports explicit self-reflection and proactively solicits human guidance when
confronted with uncertainty or repeated failure. It cuts normalized Time by ~2x
and Dream counts by ~4x vs. generative agents, achieving higher success rates,
improved interpretability, and balanced low latency compared with existing
methods. This work takes a pioneering step toward shifting VLAs from opaque
controllers to genuinely assistive agents capable of reasoning, acting, and
collaborating with humans.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PERAL是一个面向球形机器人的感知感知运动控制框架，通过内部差速驱动实现被动LiDAR激励，无需额外硬件即可增强垂直扫描多样性，提高导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水平安装的LiDAR（如MID360）在近地面捕获点云较少，限制了地形感知能力，在特征稀少环境中性能下降。现有解决方案要么牺牲水平感知，要么增加执行器、成本和功耗。

Method: 通过建模内部差速驱动与传感器姿态的耦合关系，在名义目标或轨迹跟踪命令上叠加有界非周期性振荡，实现被动LiDAR激励。

Result: 在实验室、走廊和战术环境中验证，实现高达96%的地图完整性，轨迹跟踪误差减少27%，并实现鲁棒的近地面人体检测，相比基准方案具有更低重量、功耗和成本。

Conclusion: PERAL框架成功解决了水平LiDAR近地面感知不足的问题，通过被动激励方式显著提升了导航和感知性能，且设计将开源共享。

Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots increasingly rely on LiDAR-IMU odometry for
navigation and mapping, yet horizontally mounted LiDARs such as the MID360
capture few near-ground returns, limiting terrain awareness and degrading
performance in feature-scarce environments. Prior solutions - static tilt,
active rotation, or high-density sensors - either sacrifice horizontal
perception or incur added actuators, cost, and power. We introduce PERAL, a
perception-aware motion control framework for spherical robots that achieves
passive LiDAR excitation without dedicated hardware. By modeling the coupling
between internal differential-drive actuation and sensor attitude, PERAL
superimposes bounded, non-periodic oscillations onto nominal goal- or
trajectory-tracking commands, enriching vertical scan diversity while
preserving navigation accuracy. Implemented on a compact spherical robot, PERAL
is validated across laboratory, corridor, and tactical environments.
Experiments demonstrate up to 96 percent map completeness, a 27 percent
reduction in trajectory tracking error, and robust near-ground human detection,
all at lower weight, power, and cost compared with static tilt, active
rotation, and fixed horizontal baselines. The design and code will be
open-sourced upon acceptance.

Conclusion: RCS成功填补了机器人学习研究中的工具空白，为大规模通用策略研究提供了高效支持，证明了模拟数据对提升真实世界性能的价值

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) mark a major shift in robot learning.
They replace specialized architectures and task-tailored components of expert
policies with large-scale data collection and setup-specific fine-tuning. In
this machine learning-focused workflow that is centered around models and
scalable training, traditional robotics software frameworks become a
bottleneck, while robot simulations offer only limited support for
transitioning from and to real-world experiments. In this work, we close this
gap by introducing Robot Control Stack (RCS), a lean ecosystem designed from
the ground up to support research in robot learning with large-scale generalist
policies. At its core, RCS features a modular and easily extensible layered
architecture with a unified interface for simulated and physical robots,
facilitating sim-to-real transfer. Despite its minimal footprint and
dependencies, it offers a complete feature set, enabling both real-world
experiments and large-scale training in simulation. Our contribution is
twofold: First, we introduce the architecture of RCS and explain its design
principles. Second, we evaluate its usability and performance along the
development cycle of VLA and RL policies. Our experiments also provide an
extensive evaluation of Octo, OpenVLA, and Pi Zero on multiple robots and shed
light on how simulation data can improve real-world policy performance. Our

Abstract: This paper presents a CAD-driven co-design framework for optimizing
jet-powered aerial humanoid robots to execute dynamically constrained
trajectories. Starting from the iRonCub-Mk3 model, a Design of Experiments
(DoE) approach is used to generate 5,000 geometrically varied and mechanically
feasible designs by modifying limb dimensions, jet interface geometry (e.g.,
angle and offset), and overall mass distribution. Each model is constructed
through CAD assemblies to ensure structural validity and compatibility with
simulation tools. To reduce computational cost and enable parameter sensitivity
analysis, the models are clustered using K-means, with representative centroids
selected for evaluation. A minimum-jerk trajectory is used to assess flight
performance, providing position and velocity references for a momentum-based
linearized Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy. A multi-objective
optimization is then conducted using the NSGA-II algorithm, jointly exploring
the space of design centroids and MPC gain parameters. The objectives are to
minimize trajectory tracking error and mechanical energy expenditure. The
framework outputs a set of flight-ready humanoid configurations with validated
control parameters, offering a structured method for selecting and implementing
feasible aerial humanoid designs.

Conclusion: DART框架通过结合语义理解、affordance学习和扩散策略，有效提升了关节灵巧操作的性能和泛化能力

Abstract: Despite recent advances in dexterous manipulations, the manipulation of
articulated objects and generalization across different categories remain
significant challenges. To address these issues, we introduce DART, a novel
framework that enhances a diffusion-based policy with affordance learning and
linear temporal logic (LTL) representations to improve the learning efficiency
and generalizability of articulated dexterous manipulation. Specifically, DART
leverages LTL to understand task semantics and affordance learning to identify
optimal interaction points. The {diffusion-based policy} then generalizes these
interactions across various categories. Additionally, we exploit an
optimization method based on interaction data to refine actions, overcoming the
limitations of traditional diffusion policies that typically rely on offline
reinforcement learning or learning from demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that DART outperforms most existing methods in manipulation
ability, generalization performance, transfer reasoning, and robustness. For

Motivation: 解决多机器人在未知大环境中协同覆盖的挑战，需要最小化总覆盖路径长度并减少机器人间冲突。现有方法在路径重叠和协调效率方面存在不足。

Conclusion: Multi-CAP算法通过连通性感知的层次化规划框架，有效解决了多机器人协同覆盖问题，在减少路径重叠和提高覆盖效率方面表现出色，为未知环境下的多机器人协同作业提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient coordination of multiple robots for coverage of large, unknown
environments is a significant challenge that involves minimizing the total
coverage path length while reducing inter-robot conflicts. In this paper, we
introduce a Multi-robot Connectivity-Aware Planner (Multi-CAP), a hierarchical
coverage path planning algorithm that facilitates multi-robot coordination
through a novel connectivity-aware approach. The algorithm constructs and
dynamically maintains an adjacency graph that represents the environment as a
set of connected subareas. Critically, we make the assumption that the
environment, while unknown, is bounded. This allows for incremental refinement
of the adjacency graph online to ensure its structure represents the physical
layout of the space, both in observed and unobserved areas of the map as robots
explore the environment. We frame the task of assigning subareas to robots as a
Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a well-studied problem for finding optimal
routes for a fleet of vehicles. This is used to compute disjoint tours that
minimize redundant travel, assigning each robot a unique, non-conflicting set
of subareas. Each robot then executes its assigned tour, independently adapting
its coverage strategy within each subarea to minimize path length based on
real-time sensor observations of the subarea. We demonstrate through
simulations and multi-robot hardware experiments that Multi-CAP significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in key metrics, including coverage time,
total path length, and path overlap ratio. Ablation studies further validate
the critical role of our connectivity-aware graph and the global tour planner
in achieving these performance gains.

Abstract: Semantic SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems enrich robot
maps with structural and semantic information, enabling robots to operate more
effectively in complex environments. However, these systems struggle in
real-world scenarios with occlusions, incomplete data, or ambiguous geometries,
as they cannot fully leverage the higher-level spatial and semantic knowledge
humans naturally apply. We introduce HICS-SLAM, a Human-in-the-Loop semantic
SLAM framework that uses a shared extended reality environment for real-time
collaboration. The system allows human operators to directly interact with and
visualize the robot's 3D scene graph, and add high-level semantic concepts
(e.g., rooms or structural entities) into the mapping process. We propose a
graph-based semantic fusion methodology that integrates these human
interventions with robot perception, enabling scalable collaboration for
enhanced situational awareness. Experimental evaluations on real-world
construction site datasets demonstrate improvements in room detection accuracy,
map precision, and semantic completeness compared to automated baselines,
demonstrating both the effectiveness of the approach and its potential for
future extensions.

Abstract: We propose a neuromorphic tactile sensing framework for robotic texture
classification that is inspired by human exploratory strategies. Our system
utilizes the NeuroTac sensor to capture neuromorphic tactile data during a
series of exploratory motions. We first tested six distinct motions for texture
classification under fixed environment: sliding, rotating, tapping, as well as
the combined motions: sliding+rotating, tapping+rotating, and tapping+sliding.
We chose sliding and sliding+rotating as the best motions based on final
accuracy and the sample timing length needed to reach converged accuracy. In
the second experiment designed to simulate complex real-world conditions, these
two motions were further evaluated under varying contact depth and speeds.
Under these conditions, our framework attained the highest accuracy of 87.33\%
with sliding+rotating while maintaining an extremely low power consumption of
only 8.04 mW. These results suggest that the sliding+rotating motion is the
optimal exploratory strategy for neuromorphic tactile sensing deployment in
texture classification tasks and holds significant promise for enhancing
robotic environmental interaction.

Abstract: Effective human-robot collaboration in surgery is affected by the inherent
ambiguity of verbal communication. This paper presents a framework for a
robotic surgical assistant that interprets and disambiguates verbal
instructions from a surgeon by grounding them in the visual context of the
operating field. The system employs a two-level affordance-based reasoning
process that first analyzes the surgical scene using a multimodal
vision-language model and then reasons about the instruction using a knowledge
base of tool capabilities. To ensure patient safety, a dual-set conformal
prediction method is used to provide a statistically rigorous confidence
measure for robot decisions, allowing it to identify and flag ambiguous
commands. We evaluated our framework on a curated dataset of ambiguous surgical
requests from cholecystectomy videos, demonstrating a general disambiguation
rate of 60% and presenting a method for safer human-robot interaction in the

Abstract: Quadrotor navigation in unknown environments is critical for practical
missions such as search-and-rescue. Solving it requires addressing three key
challenges: the non-convexity of free space due to obstacles,
quadrotor-specific dynamics and objectives, and the need for exploration of
unknown regions to find a path to the goal. Recently, the Model Predictive Path
Integral (MPPI) method has emerged as a promising solution that solves the
first two challenges. By leveraging sampling-based optimization, it can
effectively handle non-convex free space while directly optimizing over the
full quadrotor dynamics, enabling the inclusion of quadrotor-specific costs
such as energy consumption. However, its performance in unknown environments is
limited, as it lacks the ability to explore unknown regions when blocked by
large obstacles. To solve this issue, we introduce Perception-Aware MPPI
(PA-MPPI). Here, perception-awareness is defined as adapting the trajectory
online based on perception objectives. Specifically, when the goal is occluded,
PA-MPPI's perception cost biases trajectories that can perceive unknown
regions. This expands the mapped traversable space and increases the likelihood
of finding alternative paths to the goal. Through hardware experiments, we
demonstrate that PA-MPPI, running at 50 Hz with our efficient perception and
mapping module, performs up to 100% better than the baseline in our challenging
settings where the state-of-the-art MPPI fails. In addition, we demonstrate
that PA-MPPI can be used as a safe and robust action policy for navigation
foundation models, which often provide goal poses that are not directly
reachable.

Abstract: Mobile manipulation requires the coordinated control of a mobile base and a
robotic arm while simultaneously perceiving both global scene context and
fine-grained object details. Existing single-view approaches often fail in
unstructured environments due to limited fields of view, exploration, and
generalization abilities. Moreover, classical controllers, although stable,
struggle with efficiency and manipulability near singularities. To address
these challenges, we propose M4Diffuser, a hybrid framework that integrates a
Multi-View Diffusion Policy with a novel Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP
(ReM-QP) controller for mobile manipulation. The diffusion policy leverages
proprioceptive states and complementary camera perspectives with both
close-range object details and global scene context to generate task-relevant
end-effector goals in the world frame. These high-level goals are then executed
by the ReM-QP controller, which eliminates slack variables for computational
efficiency and incorporates manipulability-aware preferences for robustness
near singularities. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world
environments show that M4Diffuser achieves 7 to 56 percent higher success rates
and reduces collisions by 3 to 31 percent over baselines. Our approach
demonstrates robust performance for smooth whole-body coordination, and strong
generalization to unseen tasks, paving the way for reliable mobile manipulation
in unstructured environments. Details of the demo and supplemental material are
available on our project website https://sites.google.com/view/m4diffuser.

Abstract: In-hand manipulation tasks, particularly in human-inspired robotic systems,
must rely on distributed tactile sensing to achieve precise control across a
wide variety of tasks. However, the optimal configuration of this network of
sensors is a complex problem, and while the fingertips are a common choice for
placing sensors, the contribution of tactile information from other regions of
the hand is often overlooked. This work investigates the impact of tactile
feedback from various regions of the fingers and palm in performing in-hand
object reorientation tasks. We analyze how sensory feedback from different
parts of the hand influences the robustness of deep reinforcement learning
control policies and investigate the relationship between object
characteristics and optimal sensor placement. We identify which tactile sensing
configurations contribute to improving the efficiency and accuracy of
manipulation. Our results provide valuable insights for the design and use of

Abstract: Scaling up the deployment of autonomous excavators is of great economic and
societal importance. Yet it remains a challenging problem, as effective systems
must robustly handle unseen worksite conditions and new hardware
configurations. Current state-of-the-art approaches rely on highly engineered,
task-specific controllers, which require extensive manual tuning for each new
scenario. In contrast, recent advances in large-scale pretrained models have
shown remarkable adaptability across tasks and embodiments in domains such as
manipulation and navigation, but their applicability to heavy construction
machinery remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce ExT, a unified
open-source framework for large-scale demonstration collection, pretraining,
and fine-tuning of multitask excavation policies. ExT policies are first
trained on large-scale demonstrations collected from a mix of experts, then
fine-tuned either with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning
fine-tuning (RLFT) to specialize to new tasks or operating conditions. Through
both simulation and real-world experiments, we show that pretrained ExT
policies can execute complete excavation cycles with centimeter-level accuracy,
successfully transferring from simulation to real machine with performance
comparable to specialized single-task controllers. Furthermore, in simulation,
we demonstrate that ExT's fine-tuning pipelines allow rapid adaptation to new
tasks, out-of-distribution conditions, and machine configurations, while
maintaining strong performance on previously learned tasks. These results
highlight the potential of ExT to serve as a foundation for scalable and
generalizable autonomous excavation.

Abstract: Reliable, drift-free global localization presents significant challenges yet
remains crucial for autonomous navigation in large-scale dynamic environments.
In this paper, we introduce a tightly-coupled Semantic-LiDAR-Inertial-Wheel
Odometry fusion framework, which is specifically designed to provide
high-precision state estimation and robust localization in large-scale dynamic
environments. Our framework leverages an efficient semantic-voxel map
representation and employs an improved scan matching algorithm, which utilizes
global semantic information to significantly reduce long-term trajectory drift.
Furthermore, it seamlessly fuses data from LiDAR, IMU, and wheel odometry using
a tightly-coupled multi-sensor fusion Iterative Error-State Kalman Filter
(iESKF). This ensures reliable localization without experiencing abnormal
drift. Moreover, to tackle the challenges posed by terrain variations and
dynamic movements, we introduce a 3D adaptive scaling strategy that allows for
flexible adjustments to wheel odometry measurement weights, thereby enhancing
localization precision. This study presents extensive real-world experiments
conducted in a one-million-square-meter automated port, encompassing 3,575
hours of operational data from 35 Intelligent Guided Vehicles (IGVs). The
results consistently demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art
LiDAR-based localization methods in large-scale dynamic environments,
highlighting the framework's reliability and practical value.

Abstract: We propose a new formulation for the multi-robot task allocation problem that
incorporates (a) complex precedence relationships between tasks, (b) efficient
intra-task coordination, and (c) cooperation through the formation of robot
coalitions. A task graph specifies the tasks and their relationships, and a set
of reward functions models the effects of coalition size and preceding task
performance. Maximizing task rewards is NP-hard; hence, we propose network
flow-based algorithms to approximate solutions efficiently. A novel online
algorithm performs iterative re-allocation, providing robustness to task
failures and model inaccuracies to achieve higher performance than offline
approaches. We comprehensively evaluate the algorithms in a testbed with random
missions and reward functions and compare them to a mixed-integer solver and a
greedy heuristic. Additionally, we validate the overall approach in an advanced
simulator, modeling reward functions based on realistic physical phenomena and
executing the tasks with realistic robot dynamics. Results establish efficacy
in modeling complex missions and efficiency in generating high-fidelity task
plans while leveraging task relationships.

Result: 在8个真实世界任务评估中，该框架优于现有的最先进VLA方法

Conclusion: 提出的框架和训练策略为实现协作性具身代理提供了一条可行路径

Abstract: The ultimate goal of embodied agents is to create collaborators that can
interact with humans, not mere executors that passively follow instructions.
This requires agents to communicate, coordinate, and adapt their actions based
on human feedback. Recently, advances in VLAs have offered a path toward this
goal. However, most current VLA-based embodied agents operate in a one-way
mode: they receive an instruction and execute it without feedback. This
approach fails in real-world scenarios where instructions are often ambiguous.
In this paper, we address this problem with the Ask-to-Clarify framework. Our
framework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking questions in a
multi-turn dialogue. Then it generates low-level actions end-to-end.
Specifically, the Ask-to-Clarify framework consists of two components, one VLM
for collaboration and one diffusion for action. We also introduce a connection
module that generates conditions for the diffusion based on the output of the
VLM. This module adjusts the observation by instructions to create reliable
conditions. We train our framework with a two-stage knowledge-insulation
strategy. First, we fine-tune the collaboration component using
ambiguity-solving dialogue data to handle ambiguity. Then, we integrate the
action component while freezing the collaboration one. This preserves the
interaction abilities while fine-tuning the diffusion to generate actions. The
training strategy guarantees our framework can first ask questions, then
generate actions. During inference, a signal detector functions as a router
that helps our framework switch between asking questions and taking actions. We
evaluate the Ask-to-Clarify framework in 8 real-world tasks, where it
outperforms existing state-of-the-art VLAs. The results suggest that our
proposed framework, along with the training strategy, provides a path toward
collaborative embodied agents.

TL;DR: 提出了一种能量约束轨迹规划框架，将RTG-太阳能混合电源的累积能量预算和瞬时功率约束整合到SE(2)多项式轨迹优化中，确保轨迹平滑、动态可行且功率合规


<details>

Motivation: 未来行星探测车需要在混合电源（RTG稳定输出+太阳能可变输入）下长期运行，现有规划方法主要关注地形和几何平滑性，忽略了能量可行性和瞬时功率约束

Conclusion: 该方法为长期行星任务提供了一种原则性和实用的能量感知自主规划方法，确保轨迹在能量约束下的可行性

Abstract: Future planetary exploration rovers must operate for extended durations on
hybrid power inputs that combine steady radioisotope thermoelectric generator
(RTG) output with variable solar photovoltaic (PV) availability. While
energy-aware planning has been studied for aerial and underwater robots under
battery limits, few works for ground rovers explicitly model power flow or
enforce instantaneous power constraints. Classical terrain-aware planners
emphasize slope or traversability, and trajectory optimization methods
typically focus on geometric smoothness and dynamic feasibility, neglecting
energy feasibility. We present an energy-constrained trajectory planning
framework that explicitly integrates physics-based models of translational,
rotational, and resistive power with baseline subsystem loads, under hybrid
RTG-solar input. By incorporating both cumulative energy budgets and
instantaneous power constraints into SE(2)-based polynomial trajectory
optimization, the method ensures trajectories that are simultaneously smooth,
dynamically feasible, and power-compliant. Simulation results on lunar-like
terrain show that our planner generates trajectories with peak power within
0.55 percent of the prescribed limit, while existing methods exceed limits by
over 17 percent. This demonstrates a principled and practical approach to
energy-aware autonomy for long-duration planetary missions.

Abstract: Multivariate time-series anomaly detection, which is critical for identifying
unexpected events, has been explored in the field of machine learning for
several decades. However, directly applying these methods to data from forceful
tool use tasks is challenging because streaming sensor data in the real world
tends to be inherently noisy, exhibits non-stationary behavior, and varies
across different tasks and tools. To address these challenges, we propose a
method, AnoF-Diff, based on the diffusion model to extract force-torque
features from time-series data and use force-torque features to detect
anomalies. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods in terms
of F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC)
on four forceful tool-use tasks, demonstrating that our method has better
performance and is more robust to a noisy dataset. We also propose the method
of parallel anomaly score evaluation based on one-step diffusion and
demonstrate how our method can be used for online anomaly detection in several
forceful tool use experiments.

Abstract: Soft growing robots, commonly referred to as vine robots, have demonstrated
remarkable ability to interact safely and robustly with unstructured and
dynamic environments. It is therefore natural to exploit contact with the
environment for planning and design optimization tasks. Previous research has
focused on planning under contact for passively deforming robots with
pre-formed bends. However, adding active steering to these soft growing robots
is necessary for successful navigation in more complex environments. To this
end, we develop a unified modeling framework that integrates vine robot growth,
bending, actuation, and obstacle contact. We extend the beam moment model to
include the effects of actuation on kinematics under growth and then use these
models to develop a fast parallel simulation framework. We validate our model
and simulator with real robot experiments. To showcase the capabilities of our
framework, we apply our model in a design optimization task to find designs for
vine robots navigating through cluttered environments, identifying designs that
minimize the number of required actuators by exploiting environmental contacts.
We show the robustness of the designs to environmental and manufacturing
uncertainties. Finally, we fabricate an optimized design and successfully
deploy it in an obstacle-rich environment.
